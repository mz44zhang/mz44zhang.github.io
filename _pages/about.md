Welcome to my personal website! My name is Maggie Zhang 张梦情. I am a PhD candidate in [Institute of Communications Research (ICR)](https://media.illinois.edu/icr) at University of Illinois-Urabna Champaign (UIUC), advised by Prof. [Margaret Yee Man Ng](https://media.illinois.edu/journalism/ng-margaret-yee-man) and [Harsh Taneja](https://media.illinois.edu/advertising/taneja-harsh).

Research Interests
==================

My scholarship is at the intersection of social media and AI, with a particular focus on understanding how these technologies are transforming communication, public discourse, and user behavior. My research combines computational methods, such as natural language processing and computer vision, with experimental designs and social science theories to examine the complex interplay between social media, AI, and human interaction.

My previous projects investigate how social media platform features influence user attitudes and behavior. For instance, one study explores how Twitter trending topics shape public and individual agendas ([Zhang &amp; Ng, 2023](https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/20324), International Journal of Communication). Another examines how YouTube users react to the removal of dislike counts and its implications for user engagement (Zhang & Ng, R&R at New Media & Society). In addition, one study investigates the socializing behavior of platform-owned social bot and the influence on user engagement and behavior on microblogging platforms (Yang, Zhang, & Lysyakov, under review at Information Systems Research).


# Teaching Experience

I independently designed and developed the course [ADV 480: Social Media Analytics](https://mz44zhang.github.io/teaching/) for graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Department of Advertising, in 2023. I teach students how to use Python and R to collect social media data and analyze it using text mining and social network analysis techniques.

# Professional Experience

I am currently working as a data science and statistics consultant at the Center for Innovation in Teaching & Learning, where I provide consultation services on finding and preparing data for analysis, as well as survey construction and experiment implementation. 

Additionally, I am a full-stack engineer leading a team to develop (1) a fully functional social media platform similar to Twitter using React and Google Firebase ([link to the platform](https://twitter-clone-ai.vercel.app/)), (2) a Chrome extension that provides AI assistance for content creation on social media platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn (see a [demo here](https://social-media-ai-extension.vercel.app/welcome.html)) and (3) a chatbot web app. I have experience working with AWS, Google Firebase, and JavaScript.

I am well-versed in conducting experiments using Qualtrics and have extensive experience in machine learning and text mining.

# Publication and Awards

I have received top student paper awards from the International Communication Association and the Top Paper Award from the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.

My work have been published in peer-reviewed journals including _International Journal of Communication, Social Science Computer Review, and Journal of Marketing Communications._

Education Background
====================

I am concurrently a Master's student in Computer Science in the department of computer science and a Ph.D. candidate in communication at UIUC.

Prior to joining UIUC, I received my M.Phil degree in Communication from [School of Journalism and Communication](http://www.com.cuhk.edu.hk/en-GB/) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong where I was supervised by [Prof. Hai Liang](https://drhailiang.com/) and B.A. degree in [Journalism](https://www.tsjc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) from Tsinghua University in China.
