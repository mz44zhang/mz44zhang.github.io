Abstract
--------

This study investigates the impact of YouTube’s 2021 policy, which hides dislike counts and thus limits a form of negative social feedback, on social media herding behavior—the tendency of users to align with the majority opinion. We adopted a mixed-method approach, incorporating an online experiment that simulates the YouTube interface and an Interrupted Time Series analysis of real-world user reactions, to assess how the policy affects user engagement. The study specifically examines how the absence of one-sided digital cues, coupled with content characteristics and individual user predispositions, influences behavior. Findings suggest YouTube’s initiative to boost platform positivity had limited success: user responses were more influenced by their ideological leanings than by visible digital cues. Hiding dislikes appears to diminish commenting frequencies and may inadvertently increase negative expression. These results highlight the stronger role of ideological beliefs over social cues in shaping engagement, contesting the presumed impact of audience conformity and the negativity bias on social media dynamics.
