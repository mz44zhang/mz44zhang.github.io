5," So very Meh...
",tommy-97761,/user/ur150551506/,28 February 2023,"I am very glad that I skipped the cinema and opted to wait for a VOD release. Though there definitely were good moments, overall the movie feels bland, formulaic, drawn, long, BORING.There are absolutely no stakes in these movies anymore and hence the actionscenes are just redundant. Though the characterwork is still better, but I feel like the Marvel movies are on a trajectory towards Transformers. Basically just colorfull fluff to fill the time when you happen to find yourself on a flight but nothing esential, even if you are a comicbook fan. I mean, bullets no longer pose a threat, not only when wearing the Black Panter costume but to the dora milaje either. One person receives a pretty much fatal wound and acts like it's nothing at all, just a fleshwound. If no-one is in any kind of danger, then why should I as a viewer be interested in anything that happens?"
10," 2nd highest grossing Marvel film in 2022 for a reason
",BlackEden,/user/ur30300801/,28 February 2023,"Despite the rac*st and m*sogynistic reviews, this film surpassed every other Marvel movie that came out this year, except Dr Strange, in gross revenue! The reason being? It was fantastic!As someone who isn't normally a fan of Marvel or simple action movies, I thought this was a really well done film. So much detail went into creating an alternative world, taking a lot from African cultures before they were devastated by European c0lonialism. The costumes were also well researched, culturally relevant, innovative, and beautiful.I also really appreciated the detail that went into the Talokan tribe, with many references from Mayan art and attire. My only issue with them was that after so many years of living underwater, the people could have at least evolved webbed feet and fingers by then. It didn't pull away from the movie though - that's just my sci fi nerd nitpicking.The cast was great! I like how this movie focused more on strong black women - hardly any movies do this. They produced some great fight scenes and provided some humour woven throughout the story. There were some deeper meanings behind a lot of the scenes, especially as they relate to historic and contemporary parallels of wh*te supremacy (loved it when they made the European c0lonizers kneel - great parallel to Kaepernick's activism in real life).Overall, I was never bored and enjoyed watching this movie. Action, comedy, and heartbreak were all wrapped into one cohesive film. I'm excited to see the next chapter!"
5," Waterlogged and lost
",valorousjames,/user/ur83530766/,27 February 2023,"The film moves far too slowly with fruitless exposition on loss and the evils of colonialism. It's bloated runtime makes it a painful watch that barely holds your attention. The lack of a strong central personality to provide cohesion and direction rather than what feels like a revolving door of ancillary characters in mourning slowing the plot to a crawl. New addition Riri Williams as Ironheart was a big miss for the film. When introduced she is arrogant and unlikeable, but quickly she becomes a flat and boring macguffin. Her final costume design is also laughably bad when compared to how great all the other costume and design choices were in the film. Perhaps, in my opinion, the biggest missed opportunity is Namor and his people. Making them a derivative of a native Mexican culture rather than being true to the source material or creating a new and novel civilization comes across as a forced agenda driven decision rather than a true artistic endeavor. The choice was clearly made to have exposition on the evils of colonialism. This exposition is lost on or moot for much of the target audience. Agenda as a plot device has become tiresome and exceedingly shallow at this point particularly when it detracts from the quality of the end product as I feel it did here. I firmly believe that faithfulness to the comic Namor or had they broke new ground would have served the film tremendously. Aside from that personal quibble I did like Tenoch Huerta in the role. He very much grabbed my attention when he was oncscreen, but not as much as M'baku(Winston Duke) who is a scene stealer. It really hurt the film that he has so much more screen presence than Shuri(Letitia Wright) or the Queen Romonda(Angela Bassett). Queen Romonda does have a few strong moments on her own to be fair. Now the problem of the final act. It is beyond lackluster. It has no honest drama to pull you in. It just does not do a good job making you believe that there is much riding on this final confrontation. I also lacks a lot of the fun eye candy in which Marvel films tend to excel. Finally, the worst issue for this film is nothing with it per se, but more the presence of who is not there. The loss of Chadwick Boseman was awful, and I truly wish he could have reprised his role as T'Challa. His memory haunts this film terribly. There are many moments of reflection and questioning how to go forward without him causing characters throughout to be directionless and unmotivated. Loss is a major point of the film's message, but unfortunately it puts a nearly insurmountable hurdle in the way of the story. Without Chadwick Boseman I fear that the Black Panther franchise may be irrevocably wounded without his strong endearing screen presence."
4," Plodding
",cstruvemd,/user/ur52334276/,27 February 2023,"I will let the title summarize it but my true contribution to this thread will be a simple observation. Before I watched it, I read ALOT of the reviews by people on this site. I have never seen so many 5-6s with words that would normally reflect 3 or lower. Its as if no one is willing to say the obvious, namely that this movie is just not that good (like almost all of Phase 4). Ultimately I think everyone at Marvel struggled to deal with Boseman's death and how to pay tribute without allowing his death to overshadow the entire movie. I would point to one user's comment that they should have waited longer but of course Marvel cant do that. My $0.03 (inflation you know) would be to pass it on by if you didnt like Phase 4. I certainly wouldnt pay real money to see it."
7," Wankada Forever has a lot going on
",Entertainmentsparadise,/user/ur131752399/,27 February 2023,"Upon my initial watch of Wakanda Forever, I was slightly underwhelmed, coming in with no expectations. However, the film had a lot to tackle in a short two and half hours long movie. It did appeal heavily to emotions. Of course, the film focus on the mourning of T'Challa. But it also has an arduous task of attempting to fill those shoes and introduce us to a new world and antagonist. All of which can serve as a stand-alone central theme for a movie. With that being said, I had a tough time grappling with the development of the plot, the main issue, and how it all culminated. Unfortunately, the revenge aspect was the least convincing arc of this film.What stood out to me was the disrespect to tradition and the illogical methods afterward.Although some critiques ultimately led me to compare my feelings for the original Black Panther film, there were also some good ones.As I mentioned earlier, the emotions were on point. Angela Bassett acted her ass off in this movie. Also, what's a Marvel movie without a cameo or introducing a new character from the universe? Also, did we finally hear the word ""Mutant"" in the Marvel cinematic universe?Ultimately Wankada Forever has a lot going on; it thrives by including representation and political aspects while also incorporating three challenging elements of mourning, development, and integration. While that's positive, it is also a fault; I left the movie feeling underwhelmed by what I watched. I feel this is the filler movie that needed to tie up loose ends and project us into the next sequence. The ending credit scene was the icing on the cake. Therefore I rate Wakanda Forever a 7/10 3.5
Long live the King."
4," Lose an hour and it may have worked
",wms59,/user/ur0821805/,27 February 2023,"Made the mistake of choosing this for a family movie night. I found the whole thing dragged interminably along and should have had tighter direction, and losing around an hour in the process.It was interesting that when discussing it with the rest of my family afterwards, we all had similar thoughts on the script and direction.Interestingly we thought the acting was, with a few exceptions, fine, it was just the material they had been given that was suspect.Although we realise that a main thrust of the story was on the family dynamics as they come to terms with recent events, it did seem as though actors such as Martin Freeman were woefully under-utilised; to the point where they could have been written out altogether with no change to the story.."
1," Worst mcu movie
",zraw,/user/ur80330868/,27 February 2023,"I've seen every mcu movie and show to date. They handled Chadwick's passing horribly and didn't give him or his character justice huge let down to be completely honest, I had very high hopes for the film hoping it would be a great addition and keep his name alive but they should've just let him and his stand alone move stay at its place where it was and not soil another name In the mcu with a terrible filler movie will not be watching again. For this to be the only movie I won't watch from the mcu twice says great deals because I give plenty of films the benefit of a doubt and even a second chance but this movie is not it I'd go back and watch the first two Thor films again before I was this very big let down from marvel since Chadwick had such a big impact on so many myself included."
3," Bloated and Unfocused Mess
",PartTimeCritic,/user/ur162720103/,26 February 2023,"THE BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER (C-) is a bloated film hobbled and rendered relatively inert by trying to serve far too many ends. First and foremost, Ryan Coogler wants this to be a serious and high-minded superhero film: it plays with heavy themes of imperialism & vengeance, includes plenty of long sit down talks about those themes, and checks off almost every desire for a diverse cast. Second, the film tries to be a sequel to ""Black Panther"" despite the hole left by the deceased Chadwick Boseman. Lastly, the film tries to be part of the wider MCU, introducing new kingdoms and characters to the ongoing MCU story. The three never fully mesh and often act against each other. The high minded part of the film thankfully gives us some beautiful and imaginative art direction as well as a great musical score, but it unfortunately just feels like a rehash of the same questions the first one brought up. It bloats the film and cuts off any of the fun spectacle that the second two goals were trying to accomplish. On that second goal, the film is just not able to replace the charisma that Boseman brought. Shuri is a nice secondary character, but whether its due to the writing/direction/performance, she just isn't as compelling, decisive, or believable as a main. Lastly, having to conform to the formula of an MCU film often led to those serious sequences being undercut by a dumb and subpar, but mandatory as an MCU film, action sequence. I'd be a bit more forgiving of the attempt to be serious if there was much interesting in what the film was trying to says. In one example, we have a serious moment between the Queen and Shuri (who is a strong scientist) where Shuri doubts her mother's belief that the passed away T'Challa is in the wind like she is experiencing. I thought, maybe the film will be an interesting discussion of science vs. Faith that will have ramifications for the MCU...but Shuri eventually takes the same ""protector liquid"" that takes people to the ancestral plane and is just proved wrong. No thoughtful discussions here - the decision to keep the MCU intact wins out. Another example, but going the other way is a moment where Shuri has her new strength (from the protector liquid) and puts on the Black Panther suit and like a strong main character she is dropped right into the middle of the discussion of whether to go to war with Namor and his tribe. This conversation feels like it goes on and on and gets bogged down with the seriousness and moral ambiguity the director wants for the film. This should have been an easy decision in the MCU direction - you partner Shuri's first appearance with the black panther suit with a triumphant black and white ""I'm the new blank panther moment"" audience cheer, not with a drawn-out ambiguous war discussion. But that didn't happen because Coogler wants Shuri to be wrong here - driven by vengeance and the real problem is not with the misunderstandings between the two noble oppressed groups, but with the devious American imperializers. Think about this encapsulation of the film, we essentially get the female reboot of Iron Man in this film and it's this throw away storyline that the film really doesn't care about and is so generic that I literally could write, ""black female college student that is high tech smarter than others"" and you'd know pretty much everything about her the film wants to tell us. I wasn't a big fan of the first Black Panther film, but at least that one was more focused and anchored with by Bosewick's moral integrity. This one is a mess."
5," Mediocre, below bad.
",dsilvamontanha,/user/ur150314900/,26 February 2023,"Look, to begin with, one thing that bothered me watching this movie was, they did not reveal the reason for the death of the panther, I know that everyone knows the reason for the death of the actor, but I believe that it would not cost to invent a dignified death for the character, and not just say he just died for unknown reasons. And now talking about the direction I find such a mediocre corner, fight scenes that are not cool or fun, some epic moments and the action scenes have many unnecessary cuts. And now talking about the story, it's interesting, about how wakanda is a superpower, but a defect is that if wakanda is a superpower then why didn't it just go and kill namor and his army at once, and why talking about namor, the villain of this movie is not that interesting story nice but not gripping, and there is a part of the movie that namor could have destroyed and killed everyone there, and I wonder why he didn't! And then he comes with a story that he's going to take some time to bring his army to destroy wakanda, no, that's serious!! In summary, it's but a bad Marvel movie that made a lot of money and that didn't please and didn't even have the result that many imagined it would have."
4," The ultimate sub-par sequel
",tarushin,/user/ur75766783/,26 February 2023,"This is a not so short and not so sweet review ... ;)This sequel was very underwhelming , the story is very very confused . It tries really hard to force many uninteresting stories !The lead actors were unable to really cary the story . It feels very much like an episode of a series where the lead actors are on vacation and the supporting cast steps in to tell the story - which is understandable due to the absence of Chadwick. The movie goes to great lengths to honour Chadwick , which is commendable ,but lingers a little too long , 3 ardeous hours too long. In my humble opinion , I feel a more appropriate way to honour the brillance of the man would simply have been to make a better movie . Sadly this just doesnt cut it and that is the REAL tragedy of this movie.The story drags and the action is a bit of a yawn to be honest. I dont understand how you can go from creating Avengers Endgame , possibly one of the greatest action flicks of recent times , to this half baked attempt ; possibly one of the worst movies of recent times . It is truly really puzzling!The final nail in the snoozefest cofin is the villain who is a merman Aztec from the deep sea for some reason ? Without giving away any spoilers , the action sequences which follow after the introduction of this character are truly laughable.All in all its long ,boring , unintersting , muddled, confusing and quite frankly a huge let down. The most interesting 5 minutes is when Michael B Jordon makes an appearance. His cahrisma and screen prescence instantly elevates the material , albeit briefly.In my opinion save yourself 3 hours of agony , honour Chadwick and go watch the first Black Panther to get your action fix !"
8," Really good !
",gehriquentin,/user/ur155518392/,26 February 2023,"That's a really good movie, to be honest I didn't really love the first one.Namor is a really good villain who is not only bad or good. I was happy to see IronHearth being introduced in the movie. There wasn't too much jokes, because sometimes their jokes are not really fun.I didn't love the new suit of Black Panther, it's ugly to see the mask putting him himself.At first, I thought it was going to be long, cause it's a two hour and half movie. I watched it in 2 or 3 times but it was never boring or too slow like peoples are saying.Honestly, I recommend you this movie even if I know that the non marvel fan won't watch it and the marvel fans will have to watch to know the story."
3," OMG.... so boring of a movie.
",pseely-09031,/user/ur94391767/,26 February 2023,"So boring so slow. I can't believe this is the sequel to the thrilling first movie..
Costumes are great and all the CGI is wonderful but the storyline is just horrible.Do yourself a favor and watch a star track or something else that has more action.Just slow and walking through mud. It's just too bad Disney's lost its magic. Once again, the sequel doesn't live up to the original movie.Angela Bassett is great but the storyline is just boring.Do yourself a favor and find a better movie. No wonder this movie didn't do well at the box office.As I said before, do yourself a favor watch this movie with lots of people so you don't have to pay attention."
4," Yawn!
",barrymw,/user/ur62880559/,25 February 2023,"There isn't anything about this that would make me want to watch it again. In trying to respect the memory of Chadwick Boseman they have forgotten what made that film so great.This is just a long winded mess with an unsatisfying unoriginal plot that we've seen a hundred times before only better.Black Panther was so rich and full of great characterisation to accompany the spectacular battle and action sequences. You cared about what happened to everyone. Here everyone is a poor copy of the original, no mean feat with so many of the original cast returning.File this under ""what were they thinking?"""
3," Slow
",mbell-56214,/user/ur67275523/,25 February 2023,"I was really hopping after the opening 10 minutes homage to Chadwick Boseman, that the film would improve, but unfortunately not.Tediously slow and predictable it just felt that there was a total lack of new ideas for this film. At just short of three hours most of this film was actually a waste of time. And even with the long run time, there was a strange lack of action in the movie.Phase 4 for Marvel, quite frankly has been an embarrassment and I'm sure Stan will be turning in his grave. It really does feel like the writers have run out of ideas. I hate to say this but I'm now filled with dread for the final Guardians of the Galaxy movie.I was really hopping after the opening 10 minutes homage to Chadwick Boseman, that the film would improve, but unfortunately not.Tediously slow and predictable it just felt that there was a total lack of new ideas for this film.

5," Boring, slow and weak plot.
",abdullahh_,/user/ur126578657/,25 February 2023,"It looks like the Marvel are evolving, but just backwards as their movies have lost their touch. It was just made to honor Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. This sequel of Black Panther was very boring and it seemed to go on and on. It didn't hook me at all. The plot was very weak with awful direction. The story was slow with little or no character development. Very flat movie for me and if you have nothing else to watch, you can watch it but I dont feel like watching this movie with my friends or family or any occasion. The ending is very flat and boring too. Never once it had my interest. I wish they end Black Panther and do not drag it further."
8," SWAG-kanda Forever: Finding Namor
",dtcwee,/user/ur98451635/,25 February 2023,"While Michael B. Jordan and the late Chadwick Boseman stole the show in the first Black Panther, every cast member in this sequel delivers an amazing performance.Letitia Wright in the main role delivers the most range, from grief to fury, far from the cocky savant in other Marvel movies.Angela Basset is supposed to be a queen, but amps it up to Goddess.Danai Gurira takes haughty warrior to the next level, and navigates it through a fairly dramatic arc.The less-melanin-endowed - Tenoch Huerta, Martin Freeman, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus - also bring their a-game, dropping lines like bombs throughout.Everyone has so much swagger that those with slightly less screen time, like Winston Duke, Dominique Thorne, and Lupita Nyong'o are drowned out or do not get the development they deserve.There are so many important characters that some disappear for big chunks of the film. Wakanda Forever, at 2 hours 40 minutes could have been 2 films, though I was never bored.It's a pity that the great performances are poorly supported by forgettable dialogue and clumsy plotting.Even with that handicap, the actors go beyond having chemistry to be more like pieces of flint striking each other and giving off sparks. The tension is picked up by decent camera work, zoom, and framing.Which brings me the worst part for me. The 2:39 extra-wide aspect ratio is best suited to wide Imax vistas, of which the movie has very few. When used on ensemble dramas, the cropping of characters becomes distractingly clear as does the empty space to the sides. (I kept checking my TV settings to see if they were the problem.) It's even wrong for the battle sequences, which instead of being wide line clashes play out vertically, on tall structures or surface-to-sky.Despite these difficulties, Wakanda Forever is full of actors and characters I would love to see again.""Uhambe"" for now."
8," Commendable
",Prasil15,/user/ur85639547/,25 February 2023,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a very nice effort. Letitia Wright's performance as Shiru was admirable.The story of the movie was decent. The movie is very well directed. The songs were sounding perfect in the background. The costumes of the characters were beautiful. The cinematography was also adequate. All the emotional scenes were well executed. At some places, the story was falling apart, but the brilliant performances saved that. The fighting scenes were satisfactory.In a nutshell, it was enjoyable and it could have been extra-ordinary, but it was a good and memorable tribute to Chadwick Boseman."
10," W Movie. Kind of insane how a story this good was pulled off.
",bellvk,/user/ur162527304/,25 February 2023,"How does a society cope when its greatest defender and spiritual leader is no longer there to protect and ensure the well being of the people? Truly, Wakanda Forever is a story unique and distinct compared to all the other marvel movies. I have no explanation for why the reviews here seem to be so negative. For all the nitpicking you can do, in the end the plot was insanely ambitious and the creators pull it off magnificently. The conflicts and tension throughout kept me on edge and the introduction of Atlantis as a mirror to Wakanda was an incredible choice.This movie left more of an impact on me than most marvel movies. I was shocked that it rated lower on IMDB than Ant man or Dr Strange Multiverse or Love and Thunder.... I don't mind those films like some other marvel fans but rating Wakanda Forever as lower really makes zero sense. I'd hate to think there is a negative bias to the Black Panther series.Seriously this is a very mature film that blew my expectations away and raised my hope and excitement for the next story into the stratosphere. The only mid part of the script was the random teenage engineer character, but apart from that, a hell of a movie and one that honours the late Chadwick Boseman. All Hail."

Some of the characters didn't seem right in the film and maybe should have been introduced in a different film or could have had more time developing them.the tribute to Chadwick Boseman was a nice touch but he should have been recast as he wished rather than having him killed off."
2," Pure political correctness
",yu_yickd,/user/ur141872042/,25 February 2023,"It was a disaster. After the death of the Black Panther King, the sense of solemnity and Marvel style shenanigans under internal troubles and foreign conflicts intermittently appeared, which dealt a devastating blow to the characters on the basis of the already shallow group image creation. The spectacle presentation of the new country and the Marvel Universe interaction task imposed by studio even squeezed out the role of the first protagonist Suri. When the drama is out of control, there is only one action scene, but it is also full of almost zero action design, shot editing that seems to avoid action description and strong CG sense. The most ridiculous thing is that the feminist point of view is carried out from the beginning to the end, and Shuri's growth is so valuable (btw's acting is very poor), from others to her full protection to her full protection, the last minute egg disgusting face finally can not be maintained, and there is still a little prince, or a man who wants to win the fruits of the revolution. Sure enough, the throne can only be sat by men, who win the final moment but foil. Namo is very big down there. It's the only one worth seeing."
4," Wakanda Forever? No, it just feels like it
",NavyOrion,/user/ur13246564/,25 February 2023,"""Wakanda Forever"" is saved from being the worst MCU movie by one thing: the fact that ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" was even worse. But at least Thor 4 didn't take almost three hours to suck so badly.Letitia Wright, as Princess Shuri, was just fine playing a sidekick role and providing some comic relief in ""Black Panther,"" supporting Chadwick Boseman. But forced by his death to take over the lead, she just can't cut it, having neither the acting ability nor the screen presence to carry a movie, let alone the physicality to portray a believable super-hero. Angela Basset, normally an excellent actress of depth and gravitas, is relegated to petulant screaming and temper tantrums until she is mercifully allowed to be killed off. And while Dominique Thorne did well in her role as the black female Tony Stark, after being the driving character for the first act, she was simply forgotten for much of the rest of the movie, until debuting as Ironheart, in a suit that looked like a design rejected for the Power Rangers movie.Granted, the death of the starring actor left the producers in a bad situation, but writing out the character was the wrong answer. I can't help but think that simply recasting T'Challa would have been a better solution. It would have been difficult to replace Boseman, but if nothing else, maybe they could have attracted better writers.The cgi was adequate, but wasted on implausible scenes and badly-choreographed fight scenes, which came and went with no more lasting effect than a dance scene in a Baliwood musical. The dialog was bland, the plot was thin and unrealistic, and the villian was not only poorly-motivated and ultimately unthreatening, but frankly silly-looking (pigeon wings on his ankles, seriously?)I'm glad I didn't see this dumpster fire in the theater, but waited until it was streaming on Disney, so that I didn't waste $15; the bad news is that I wasted almost three hours of my life. Unfortunately, ""Wakanda Forever"" is just another example of how the Disney movie-by-committee format is bringing down yet another once-great franchise."

The first one is that, it proved Chadwick Boseman could not be replaced. Oh, and by the way, for the n'th time, why oh why pander to the current fad to make the film so dark, and the sound so muffled? It adds nothing to the drama, it's just annoying. As so often, cgi is inserted to cover up a lack of a coherent story-line, previous characters are wheeled in to provide continuity (they don't) and (bless) the shots of the undersea dwellers look like normal humans holding their breath while smiling. And last but by no means least - how does Martin Freeman get these parts?

",TheDanishMovie-Nerd,/user/ur157552764/,24 February 2023,"Wakanda Forever, the latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Phase Four, is another average entry in the franchise. The movie has some positive highlights, including stunning world-building and visual style in the first half. However, in the third act, the film loses its visual flair, becoming comparable to a Saturday morning cartoon with goofy and awkward CGI animations.The central performances are fine, with Angela Basset standing out as she steals every scene she appears in. The plot is a little messy, with a couple of unnecessary side quests that didn't add much to the movie and felt like a set-up for future films that the studio forced in.The absence of T'challa is felt throughout the movie, and it's clear how much Chadwick Boseman brought to the first movie. He is truly missed, and may he rest in peace.Wakanda Forever is another average addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Phase Four. While some positive aspects include stunning world-building and fine performances, the film's messy plot and forced set-up for future movies detract from the overall experience. The absence of Chadwick Boseman is deeply felt, and his talent is sorely missed. Fans of the franchise may still enjoy this latest instalment, but it falls short of its predecessor's greatness."
8," One of the best marvel movies
",PJMZdanowski,/user/ur21651443/,24 February 2023,"Having been raised on comic books I like watching Marvel movies, but lets be frank: most of them are pretty predictable, poorly acted and can only serve as a pure popcorn entertainment, best consumed when you are too tired to do anything else, but want to see some cool fights and have a few laughs. This one however was extremely refreshing, with a much more powerful emotional scenes, awe inspiring visuals and quite fresh designs of two exotic nations. The almost all female ensemble on the side of Wakanda delivered really great performances and the Namor was also depicted in fascinating way, that will probably make him one of the most interesting villain/anti-heroes of the whole franchise. Overall this is probably the best part of this phase and probably one of the best in the entire marvel slate."
2," Worse than Thor: Love and Thunder
",moritzpracher111,/user/ur44656587/,24 February 2023,"The whole Movie was way too long and still the story and the characters had no depth to me. The underwater scenes were too dark for watching it at home and the action scenes felt very boring. And Agent Ross also barely appeared in it, even tough he was the only humorous character in the first film and since marvel loves to use childish humor in their movies it felt like they tried it a bit here, but it didn't work out at all. I can't even tell if it was meant to be funny at some moments or not. The funeral tough was executed in a very good way and felt like a good tribute to chadwick and the appearance of killmonger was also good.Overall the movies is just lame, I am glad I didn't watch it in the cinema."
6," An hour too long
",elgraefen,/user/ur68264897/,23 February 2023,"I was on 2 overseas flights for a total of 19 hours, and that's how long it took me to slog through this movie, and that's with nothing esle new or interesting to watch. I kept starting and stopping it, because it is soooooo slooooow. It feels as if there are thirty minutes of film dedicated to simply watching the main character think. If they cut an hour out of it, it might make for a pretty good flick, and maybe even get up 7.5 stars. It also struggles with no big name stars to carry it. The storyline is fairly interesting, and the action scenes are well done, but there's just not enough of either."
10," I mean what can you say about this film!
",sidelsworthy,/user/ur161017734/,23 February 2023,For a film that was a tribute act to Chadwick I'd honestly say that they could have done some things to the film. Like add more to Shuri's story. Or make Queen Ramonda's death a little bit more tense to add suspense and drama to the film. I think that Ryan Coogler and Kevin Feige executed off a brilliant way to end Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They need to add more into the story of the Talokan people in Phase 5 or 6 (that would be cool) just so people can contrast between the Talokans and the Wakandans. Overall I think Tenoch Huerta's acting debut is spectacular. He really portrays the character well.
5," No need to see it more than once...
",isabelleskogh,/user/ur153232593/,23 February 2023,"For obvious reasons, I knew going in that this movie wouldn't measure up to the first BP movie. Still, I rarely miss out on watching a Marvel movie but in the end, I personally feel that this movie was barely worth the price of the money ticket. Especially considering when it was released on Disney+ like two months later. I've seen it once and have no desire och interest to ever see it again. This is one of the latest Marvel sequels that was just simply disappointing, overrated and overpriced. A sign that the Marvel movie magic is wearing off and that they're gonna have to work harder to measure up to the early movies' standard..."
7," Not what I expected
",muhammad-tahatariqstudentboras,/user/ur162637450/,23 February 2023,"It was a pretty good film, and interesting. It had the new balck panther and the new water people. It had all the things a person can expect from a intersting movie. But I disliked that they didnt pay a lot of respect to mr Boseman. They could have put an ending that said rest in piece blackpanther, but they didn't. It was just in the start. They could have shown more of the vibranium because that is the material that is the best thing wakanda has. They could have shown Africa better, and not just killed black-panthers mom so easily. I also think that they could have continued the story a bit more like the Black panther 1, and not just add a whole another thing."
8," A film that pulled off the impossible
",dakotadickenson-83457,/user/ur161212279/,22 February 2023,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is one of the best projects of Phase 4 of the MCU and I was glad they saved this for last, unless you count the Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special. After the real life death of Chadwick Boseman, who played King T'challa of Wakanda in the first Black Panther, it looked like this film was on the verge of not being made, but Ryan Coogler pulled off the impossible and made it work while also following key details from the comics. The film honors Chadwick Boseman in the best way that can be done and is probably one of the saddest movies of the MCU. Shuri played by Letitia Wright steps into the shoes as the lead character in this film and pulls it off successfully while using real life elements to fill in the shoes of her on screen brothers role. This is also hands down Angela Bassett's best role she's ever done as the current leader of Wakanda following King T'challa's passing and as well as one of the best performances by an actor/actress in the MCU and superhero movies period. She steals the show in every single scene she is in and knows how to grab the audiences attention making her one of the standout characters of this film. Tenoch Huerta who played the villain Namor is phenomenal and one of my favorite villains currently in the MCU. He brought us a villain that wasn't always bad and always tried to do things for the best of his people, making him a villain that audiences alike can relate too. It was great to see some of the old cast from the first Black Panther again as well as newcomers such as Riri Williams Iron Heart. It's also worth noting that the visual effects on this movie were probably some of the best to come out of Phase 4. Overall, this is a powerful film mixed with real life elements that pulled off what was thought to be impossible to do, only to pull it off in the end in a big way. Rating 8/10."
5," Not a good film
",benpulford-82589,/user/ur139502180/,22 February 2023,"Oh dear. Another rubbish marvel sequel. The film doesn't work. The story doesn't work. It's all become very ... puerile. There's something really missing from these sequels, that was ever present and perfectly attuned in the 'Infinity Saga' films and stories. What the heck was it? This film doesn't hang together at all well. It's all over the place. It's like sitting through a pop song 'video', that does little other than try to be trendy. Why has everything everywhere gone up itself? Do people not care about anything anymore? I'm so disappointed as I write this review. Story, story, story. That's what's missing. Point, point, point. That's what's missing. All these films are like computer-games too. If you fail (that is get wiped-out by the baddies), you can just start again at whatever pointless level you got wasted on. There are no consequences anymore ... to anything. You can do what you like, as long as it's no good. Funny thing, when I was a little ten year old, Black Panther was my favourite marvel comic. An age before even battery operated calculators. Maybe I'm too old to get all this ... stuff ... anymore? But a good film, a good story ... is timeless. How many people will enjoy watching any of these films in years or decades to come?"
2," Please get a new set of lights
",Waynecampbell1,/user/ur28026821/,22 February 2023,This movie was a waste of time half of it was unwatchable as it was in so much darkness that I could not see what the hell was going on I know most of the cast are black but why have the movie in so much darkness's that I can't see any one at all the director and the person in charge of lighting should find a new career. As making movie s is be on their skill set. The actors did their job and the story was ok the special affects were excellent but it all went to waste because us at home watching it can't see any action at all what was the lighting supervisor doing during the movie phoning it in from home.
1," So Much for this Avenger
",milescorn,/user/ur0863508/,21 February 2023,"Black Panther was an Aveger and yet none of the other Avengers came to his funeral?? Yet he was there when they created Ironman, Disney must not have had enough money or respect for the character to have any of the Avengers there. What a waste for a movie, oh well. Well at least they had good continuity, oh wait, nope that precious metal was used by Stark Industry's well shucks, continuity is hard. And why is this movie so dark, can hardly see it, they needed better lighting on the set. All in all one of the worst movies I have tried to watch in a long time. Right up there with films like Things, Manos Hands of Fate."
6," I really wanted to like it
",agatek0101,/user/ur57941634/,21 February 2023,"I felt kind of bad when I didn't really like the first movie. I found it quite boring and so I hoped this one might be better. The first few minutes were great with some mystery and these blue creatures with the weird masks emerging from the ocean looked amazing - quite beautiful and a bit menacing. I had high hopes for them.And then it just went downhill from there.Pity, it could have been cool. But the script was weak with lots of silly stuff happening only for the purpose of making other silly stuff possible.And the movie is way too long for that little bit of story that is there and so then we have action scenes filling the time but as it's often the case they're just too long and therefore it all becomes tiresome. There are some attempts at humour (that genius girl is annoying). There is no real suspense.The best thing about the movie - the way in which it honours the memory of Chadwick Boseman. It was nicely done and quite touching."
4," One of the worst from Marvel
",shauntyagi,/user/ur123180471/,21 February 2023,"I want my time back that I spent on this movie. One of the worst storyline and screenplay. There was a lot of directorial hiccups in the movie. Some scenes were just added purely to increase movie time. No comedy, action was average, VFX average. Everything else predictable. Namor's character was great, until the climax scene. Talokan was shown nicely. A lot of useless characters with overacting overload. Just ridiculous childish storyline disappointed me. The new suits were like cartoons. The tribute to Chadwick was great. Angela basset was good in the movie. Lupita's character was rushed in both movies. I personally did not enjoy this movie. Marvel has lost its shine."
7," Stretched but good storyline
",anuraaggupta-90835,/user/ur160876733/,21 February 2023,"Let's start with the good points - this film doesn't try to be all comedy and spectacle, like the recent Dr Strange 2 and Thor 4. In fact, there is almost zero comedy at all.It does try to bring some drama, and to make some points about the responsibility of nations to use their wealth, resources and technology for global benefit, rather than national advancement.Namor is different to the comics, but once I got past the initial differences, I think the portrayal was a good one. He isn't a one-dimensional villain, his people are descended from the Mayans, and he has proper motivation.But the film has a lot of problems. Firstly, the pacing is all over the place - it should be at least half an hour shorter. The comic-book science is paper thin (Shuri extracts DNA from plant fibres on a bracelet that has been underwater for 400 years, but cannot do the same from the recently dead plant in her lab). Shuri takes a spear right through her stomach and out of her back, but gets over it after a short breather. The Wakandan ship is breached from undersea, tilts over by 45 degrees and then the next scene it is upright and apparently seaworthy again. The fact that Namor's people take mortal wounds but get up again is never explained.And then there is still my biggest problem with Wakanda. Both Black Panther films promote the idea that Wakanda is a Utopian society, both technology and socially. Yet they still choose their leader by who is best at beating up other challengers.I think there was a missed opportunity here. Namor would be more likely to say ""join us, or if not, don't get in our way"", as he plans to attack the rest of the surface world. This would present Wakanda with a far more interesting moral dilemma - standby by and watch untold millions die, or utilise their resources and technology to aid the nations who have been trying to rob them."
3," Something is off
",GabrielSymes,/user/ur21852919/,20 February 2023,"It has all the high production values of other MCU films. In general, the story is just about okay. But there's a superficiality about the film. It does not feel like the cast are that bothered about what is going on, and exude a flippant nonchalance. This might come across as quirky, if a few characters were so inclined. But when it's most of them, it becomes annoying. It's a shame. Wakanda is an interesting concept, and when first introduced into the MCU the place made sense and worked. But when introduced, it was as a super secret lair where the inhabitants avoided involvement in the outside world. It was hidden. Now there are characters jumping in and out of Wakanda. Everyone knows about Wakanda. They've somehow accelerated Wakanda's sell-by date."
4," Snore, a mess
",uberdonkey6,/user/ur51252022/,20 February 2023,"So, it's difficult to follow an original film with a sequel. And this fails. I can hardly remember the plot. It's so involved with trying to respect Boseman, that it forgets it's not a requiem, it's supposed to be telling a cohesive and interesting story. No one can deny alot of money has been spent on effects..amd at times there is ok acting. Just makes me cry though that so much money is spent on something so self indulgent. Yeh, wat h it, but for what reason? In many ways this has damaged the 'franchise'. Makese want to puke that word, because it's clear Hollywood wants to sell whatever sold before, rather than evaluate films for what they are. But heck, adolescents will watch it and love their favourite characters.Watch it? Meh, why bother."
8," An emotional movie
",oanhtranvu,/user/ur162539891/,20 February 2023,"This is probably the most emotional and humane value film Marvel has ever made in their cinematic universe. It's quite long compared to the usual scale of standalone movies in the MCU. Therefore, for those who love movies with many action elements, it will make you feel boring. However, for me this is a good movie and brings a lot of emotions. It is the story of women and how they overcome the pain of losing a loved one. Besides introducing new superheroes, Phase 4 is also a healing phase after the End Game, and this movie does a great job of that. I feel like I've been with the characters through their pain and finally over it. I love the silence scenes Ryan created, it's a great way to pay tribute to Chadwick.The movie is great but I still can only give it 8 points because the Talokan scene is poetic but a bit dark, if it were a little brighter, it would be better but still ensure the aesthetic and realistic level that the director wanted. In addition, Iron Heart's performance has not left me too much. I will be looking forward to Dominique's better performance in her own movie."
4," Has potential but fizzle out towards the end
",ladyliliroche,/user/ur81897723/,20 February 2023,"After series of disappointing movies in phase 4 and the lacklustre of antman quantum as well, this movie did grab me in the opening scene until it started to introduce riri and the rest of the plot.I do like Namor. I think he is an interesting guy. The life underwater was interesting too but i am not sure if it fit this movie and just the overall plot.Im not a fan of this riri williams being introduced this way. A teenage girl that just happen to build a perfectly functional vibranium detector that the goverment used and yet, she is still working in a garage and not in some official goverment labs.Tony did create his outfit in a cave but it was a prototype and it took him some time after to perfected it. And yet riri created this detector in just months? Sure... her appearance is the one that caused this conflict as well. Not sure if its a great introduction to the character. (Not a comic reader so i am oblivious but not sure if I want or need to know anyway).Anyway, the battle is lacklustre, the whole thing is just meh. I like okoye and the end with the flashback did bring me some tear but again, please, have better writer.I went to watch the earlier mcu after (long flight) and wow, I felt there was just this much different. Maybe due to many events happening but none of the characters kinda touch it (looking at you eternals) made all the newer mcu feel very disjointed."
5," Poorly written
",allthepower-01422,/user/ur104749435/,20 February 2023,"We get it, we all missed the lead black panther, but there's no need to sacrifice the script and specially the motivations to act according to each character. Two or three characters act according to their personality, everybody else acts according to where the story wants to go, so, credibility is thrown out the window. Hence, the movie is frustrating, slow and at certain times annoying. When the sarcophagus is rising, the quality and attention to detail was worst than an intern paying to do an internship for carrying a bag of potatoes. The base of Kukulkans story was an extraordinary idea, but poorly developed, it seems as if the writers didn't sat down to think ""would this character do this, or that"" instead they just wrote it without care, thus, several characters lost their credibility around 3/4 of the movie. Disappointed."

",dranoosh-398-377460,/user/ur34417063/,20 February 2023,"Such a disappointment. Acting is horrible, casting is even worse, villains who look silly and not villainous, it's as if they took a Mexican drug cartel actors instead of a sci-fi storyline actors. They literally ruined Chadwick Bosemans's legacy! It's me a B rated Avatar! Wasted multiple hours of my life that I will never get back. Pushing the feminist Agenda on top of it. Disney and Hollywood has turned upside down! Not a single action scene in this movie made any sense or had anything to with any previous storyline! You can see it was a movie just made purely to make money by using Boseman's death for financial gains! Just a disgusting utter disgrace!"
3," Nothing Happens
",daniel_lajoie,/user/ur53878881/,20 February 2023,"My Marvel has fallen from grace. A franchise that seemingly never missed has had one flop after another in the post Avengers: End Game era.The movie is literally people talking about the same things for almost 3 hours. The villain is interesting and complex, or at least has the potential to be. But they've done a bad job at making his motivation believable. For a movie as long as this, that shouldn't have been a problem.Without the Black Panther the movie is listless. People don't watch comic book movies for the drama, they want action and heroes we can identify with. Something this film sorely lacks.At least the costumes and cinematography are nice."
4," Way too boring and way too long
",vn_larsen1,/user/ur42102985/,20 February 2023,"Title pretty much sums it up. I was counting down the minutes until this ended. Shuri is not an acceptable replacement for Black Panther. She was good as the cool tech nerd side character in the original, but she does not do well carrying a movie as lead. Riri was a fun addition, but the discount iron man suit was ridiculous and came out of nowhere. Namor as a character was pretty cool, but his motivation made no sense. The fact that he lost to a first day, Wish BP is crazy for anyone that knows Namor. The writing seemed to focus more on ""diversity"" and ""girl power"" than actual substance and plot. Dialogue leaned way too much on Chad's death. The opening was a great tribute to Boseman and the emotions seen definitely felt real, but they used his death in every single emotional scene that it just felt cheap. All in all, Marvel is going downhill fast."

So drawn out and unexciting. I only Watched this because its part of the marvel franchise otherwise I would have stopped it part way through. Unless you want to watch this just because it is part of the marvel universe, I would skip it entirely. This is just time you will never get back. The first black panther was so much better. I don't know why you have to write so many words for a review but I don't have any Other words to say about this movie, just super boring and long."

",Jimbreze,/user/ur157630588/,20 February 2023,Black panther wakanda forever is about what I expected. Considering a complete rewrite was needed after Chadwick death. I give credit for having a difficult task by everyone involved. As far as MCU movies it's middle to little below the others. Glad I didn't go to the theaters to watch. Opening the door to a future T'Chala was unexpected and was a good move for the future. Obviously there is future ties with namor and his people battling the non vibraniam world. The performances were solid and the cinematography was the best part. The underwater effects I liked. I'm the end a nice watch on the big screen at home. Hopefully future installments will be better.
1," Boring
",scottpolkadtel,/user/ur83432197/,20 February 2023,"Found it lacking in originality and failed to offer any surprises or twists, making the movie quite dull and monotonous.Additionally, I would say that the characters were one-dimensional and lacked depth, leaving me feeling uninvested in their struggles and triumphs. The dialogue also fell flat, lacking any real emotional impact or memorable lines.Moreover, the special effects and action scenes were mediocre at best, failing to deliver the high-intensity action that one would expect from a superhero movie.Overall, while the movie may have received critical acclaim, I found it to be underwhelming and disappointing, failing to live up to the hype that surrounded its release."
2," Lacked on multiple fronts
",ryan2023,/user/ur161168508/,19 February 2023,A big part of the movie was very dark so you could not see very well. That was a bit annoying. The storyline wasn't thought through well enough. It lacked imagination and the characters and races were very simple. They lost a chance to make a good movie. I've seen all the marvel movies and the black panther ones are my least favourite. I've rated the movie a 2 because what I did was look at all marvel movies in sequence and then this movie is the second worst. Maybe next movie can be more diverse with better actors. Add the Hulk and then it will be at least cool. Hope my review helps people. Just trying to share my love :)
," Move is made to make sure Angela Bassett can over-act
",Polat_Aydin,/user/ur1909703/,19 February 2023,"Enough has been written about this move here. It is an extremely boring, overrated, over priced Hollywood product that should be forgotten soonest. Having any category getting nominated for Academy Awards is ridiculous. CGI was great but still not as creative as the 1st Wakanda. Bassett's acting and long dialogues killed the movie. She keeps getting over emotional over and over and over, not really making sense after a while. I am a fan of her but this movie seemed to be sold to her as an opportunity for Academy Award. She has been much much better than this in most of her movies.Better to watch stupid Super Bowl commercials than this."

Lame story,lame characters (except Namor).Had so much potential with Namors character, but completely messed it up.The story has quite a few nessus.The visuals were dissapointing, the background score was dissapointing, the soundtracks were a letdown. This movie was as bad as the first one was good.If you're going to watch this movie for simple entertainment, I would advise you to stop and just go watch something else as you will not get your time back. Wakanda forever is seriously not worth it."
4," This Movie Is Pointless
",pakuntze,/user/ur162498718/,19 February 2023,"This movie exists only because the first one was too successful for no logical reasons beyond the cultural ""importance"", but minus Boseman. Honestly, with the iconic Black Panther actor being dead and with no attempt to find a better and suitable one, this movie has even less reasons to exist.But what is happening?In short, the mom of Boseman now leads the Wakands and keeps refusing to share their resources with the world despite trade agreements. The Americans are on the search for super space material aka vibranium, but one of their research ships get attacked by Aztek fishmen. Their leader Nemo ehm Namor then demands that the Wakands need to kill a scientist or else they will attack Wakanda. Shuri and bald lady find black female Tony Stark aka Ironhearth and then they mess with the FBI and get attacked by whales and fishmen. They dont wanna kill black teeny Tony Stark anymore for reasons and try to forge an alliance with the Wakands to capture the world, and apparently the fishmen also have same space magic material as Wakanda. Ofc they escape and Aztek fishmen are attacking Wakanda and kill the Queen. After the funeral, the other Wakands magically find one of the magic herbs to turn Shuri into Black Panther. They plan and eventually attack the fishmen and want to kill Mexican Killmonger with a freaking microwave, but they eventually make peace after some random visions. The Wakands find more magic herbs and plant them, and Shuri finds the son of her brother and says, he is T'Challa.There was also some plot concerning the Hobbit agent and the CIA but I didnt really bother here.(The film of course started with the upcoming death of T'Challa and his sis trying everything to save him but ultimately failed but this too well written compared to the remaining movie I don't even know if the same authors wrote it)Let's come to my rating and opinion.#1 Length
The movie is too freaking long. I don't mind long movies if they have a good plot and good characters, but this movie has neither of them, at least not good enough to justify over 2,5h. A long movie does not feel long, but this movie feels long, and I was literally exhausted after it ended.#2 Plot/ Writing
The plot and the lore in the first movie was not really that great either, but the second movie makes even less sense. It feels like after Boseman died, the Wakands lost any remaining sense of logic and morality and their enemy are a downgrade and borderline pathetic.Black Panther/ Protagonists:
For a start, it makes it harder for the new Black Panther to follow the steps of Bosemen if they emotionalize his death and funeral to the point I would call it necrophilia. Yes, he was probably the best actor for this role, which is just one reason why not making a second movie or at least not using his hero role again. Nothing against Miss Wright, but she seems to suffer from similar issues as the actresses of Batwoman. She just looks unbelievable as Black Panther and she was never a warrior in the first place, but a scientist teenager. In my opinion, Angela Basset or Florence Kassumba suit far better in the role of the Black Panther. But since even Shuri questions the role of Black Panther after her brother's death, why not letting her forge a new and own path, creating a more suitable hero identity for her and (if necessary) give her brother's hero role to his son since he even has the same name for reasons.Ironhearth aka black teeny Tony Stark had no real purpose in the movie beyond the last act, and I don't see the point of why the writers even add her? Because... she is black? Maybe it's some sort of satire as she is just a cheap and inclusive copy+paste of Tony Stark minus flaws, which could be viewed as Shuri becoming a cheap female copy+paste of the Black Panther though she has some flaws.Death of Boseman/ Black Panther:
Apart from the issue with the new BP, it felt too much like milking the charisma and importante of Boseman for the first movie to make the second movie better without even having him as actor. I admit, it's an interesting method and as I said ealier, the beginning of the movie concerning the death of T'Challa was maybe the best and most emotional part of the movie.The Bad Guys:
The blue Aztekt-Maya Fishmen and Nemo or however they were called feel like a Latin-American copy+paste from Killmonger since they both have a similar background story and goal. For the love of god, could the Wakands face an enemy who has nothing better to do than taking revenge for 200+ years old crimes against minorities/ colonialism? As I said and will say again, Namor is a bad copy of Killmonger, but even less dangerous and evil looking. He looks like a budget version of Aquaman and appears as evil and scary as Alice from Batwoman. Killmonger at least was tough and thick and felt like an actual threat to the Wakands compared to the whale riders. MCU Aquaman people also have never been found by the world because reasons. Why do they guard their cities as they are begging their prisoners to get saved by one enemy? Why did they threaten the Wakanda at first and then suddenly wanna create an alliance with them? Why do they wanna kill black teeny Tony Stark if it won't slow down the US ambitions to find vibranium (ever heard from research teams or even blueprints)and just increase their chance of getting discovered? Why do they later change their mind and do not want to kill her? It doesn't make sense, even when they suddenly want to forge an alliance with Wakanda. I don't know how the fish people would be able to win against a super nation, consider they can mostly only attack from water and do not even have an air force. Do they wait until the poles are melted or what? Not to mention that the Wakands are at best a city-state with spears and rhinos.Wakanda:
The Wakands are even dumber and weaker than before. Like, a mostly land-locked city gets ass-kicked by fish people who rely on freaking whales because its a bit wet. I don't know why the writers want to make the Wakands look good and the Yankees bad. I mean, the Wakands never bothered to help the world with any mess, let alone helping the nations bordering them from bad white crimes. And they basically do the same thing the CIA does but its... good I guess? Not sharing their resources because the world could mess around them despite the invention of Tony Stark or Caps shield helped more people than the Wakands with their spears and rhino tanks (excluding Ultron). The writers also keep trying to make Wakanda look like a superpower, while at best I would call it a city-state Switzerland with marginally better technology and a weird and stereotypical African tribal culture to the point where they used the best material in the world to create spears as standard-issued weapon. Besides the fact that they got threaten by freaking fish people who are even less advanced than they are, the Wakands are not really impressive. I don't know how well their army of like hundreds of spear wielding soldiers ad rhinos and five jets would do against the NATO, let alone the Avengers, who defeated far worse enemies.US:
The hostility of the Wakands towards the Americans makes no sense since they have allies within the US and the Avengers and the US never really bothered with the Wakands as long as they don't intervene in their business. Why don't they tell them the truth about the fishmen, especially since they blame them for the ship incident, which could lead to a war? How can Wakands openly attack CIA and FBI agents, cops and steal a CIA asset without the Americans seeing this as an act of war, let alone the incident of the ship where they blamed the Wakands? Why is the CIA, the same agency who messed around with the world for decades and responsible for awful yet impressive actions, so ridiculous stupid here?Rules:
Speaking of the first movie, it is funny that many old rules/ events/ lores from the first movie have been erased because the writers didn't bother to come up with something better. The super magic herbs have been burned down by Killmonger? Dont worry, the fishmen have them as well. The Wakands were the only civilization who have vibranium because of some space magic asteroid? Well, now it's also lying in the oceans and no one bothered to search for or even find them until the Queen refused to share with the world. At least, the mountain Wakands don't make ape noises anymore. The Wakands now put Queens in charge, and apparently they abolished the uncivilized rule of finding a king and in both movies, the Avengers/ other heroes do not exist.#3 Acting
The acting itself is fine, and T'Challas sis and mom did a great job in the first act during the death of him. But as I mentioned, actors are put in roles they do not fit in and the illogical writing makes everything worse. Huerta was a bad nemo because of the CGI and partly his acting. He did not impress me compared to the actor of Killmonger.#4 CGI
The CGI is a minor thing, but I need to mention it after Marvel launched crap such as She-Hulk, I take a closer look at it. It is overall fine, but Atlantis/ however blue fishsmurf city was called, looked rather depressive. I don't know if this intentional to make the baddies look a bit ""badder"" since their leader is a joke as villain, but maybe more colors would be nice.#5 Conclusion
Wakanda Forever is not the worst movie in the recent time released by Marvel and is not awful, which is a compliment for the MCU. It is also nice that this movie is less overhyped and treated as the second civil right movement, which allows people to actually criticize the movie.It's an okay movie, but far too long to justify the watch time. This movie could be cut down to 90 mins, and it wouldn't change much plotwise. The villains are poor copy+pastes from the first movie but now an ancient blue Latin American water tribe and their leader is a joke. The plot makes no sense, suffers from plotholes, change of rules."
8," Not bad, but not anything to write home about
",PaytonMArnett,/user/ur162006125/,19 February 2023,"Of course this had no chance of living up to the first film, especially with the passing of Chadwick Boseman. The plot is simple, but not bad. Most of the characters are somewhat bland, except Shuri. Letitia Wright is a great actress, I would have liked to see her arch fleshed out a bit more though. The biggest issue is the movie does not feel like a sequel to the first without Boseman at the helm. It also felt unnecessary to kill off the Queen. The inclusion of Riri Williams was odd, as she is an Iron Man type character shoved into an Black Panther film. With all that said, I still enjoyed it and did not have any major complaints. The MCU overall is getting stale, but this is a decent film."
9," As usual, ignore the negative reviews
",cabakota00,/user/ur17347505/,19 February 2023,"Getting VERY TIRED of people giving negative reviews b/c their chief reason is the movie is too long. How about using your brain and look up the runtime before deciding to see the movie. Then if you decide not to see said movie, don't go. Save the time writing a dumb dumb review. Rotten Tomatoes has it right!As for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever I found it enjoyable. Not a great movie but enjoyable. My review is really 8.5/10. It would be higher if:1. Yes it was too long but not terribly so.2. Some of the story is jumbled a bit. You can decide for yourself.The good: Angela Bassett. She is a Queen in my book and deserves EVERY award she is nominated for this film. It's one heck of a performance. And of course the tribute for T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is extraordinary.The reason I decided to watch this film is b/c of a speech Boseman gave at the AFI Lifetime Achievement celebrating the works of Denzel Washington. It a speech for the ages. Every time I watching it makes me cry. I highly recommend it. The video should be available on YouTube.WAKANDA FOREVER!"

",maria_garcia_us,/user/ur149691155/,19 February 2023,"I really liked Black Panther despite it's racism against white people, the ""colonizers"". The pot shots got really old not half way through the film. So I worked hard to ignore it so that I could enjoy the story and visuals.Before I watched Wakanda Forever, I had read a wide range of reviews from all over the political spectrum. So it's not like I wasn't warned.And I wasn't disappointed; it was a bad as I thought it would be. Not sure how far into the movie (not very far) when the 'colonizer' poo came. Oh and don't get me started on all the 'woman power' poo. It was throughout. And by the way, some women should NOT shave their heads. Ever. And this one didn't have as much humor as the first. And the imperfect, angry protagonist thing fell flat. Mad queen. Mad daughter. Mad warrior women. Just mad."
5," Very unsatisfying 148 minutes
",gazzellazwer,/user/ur64328003/,19 February 2023,"Iron Man rip off and a diluted Panther. It had very little to offer. Very nice costumes and colors, but that was about it. Some characters are completely useless and most dialogues are empty. Two funerals in 1 hour - and what do they do with the bodies?? The only thing I liked along with the costumes is the obvious tribute to Chadwick Bosman. The set up for the next movie seems to be like the Aqua-Aztec-elf will betray the union and perhaps the little nephew won't be so little anymore and will become another panther and revenge them all? Just a note: not sure why we had to wait for a union for 2 hours instead of reaching agreement during the underwater visit (where you need or don't need a suit?). Instead we kill the queen (with the best hairstyle by the way, honest) and then we shake hands anyway."
1," Utter garbage.
",jujudoll-39219,/user/ur162473794/,18 February 2023,"The worst Marvel film by a country mile. Apart from Shuri being the most annoying character in the entire MCU, her self absorbed wallowing in self pity doesn't make for an interesting plot, hopefully she will meet a grisly end soon leaving the way open for her nephew to step up eventually. The only redeeming factor was this new weird Namor character, who is so unrecognizable from the true Sub-Mariner character as to leave Namor McKenzie untarnished. This film would never have been allowed if Stan Lee were still around, the bastardization of the first Marvel super hero must have him spinning in his grave. Shame on all involved for being scared that you couldn't improve on DC's Aquaman, especially when the character material had so much depth to draw on. This film fails on every level, with some of the dodgiest CGI since James Bond went parachute surfing in ""Die another day"" I think this film has pretty much killed off everything that was interesting about Wakanda, good job."
2," If you thought 1st movie was mediocre stay clear of this one
",celestialode,/user/ur38221758/,18 February 2023,"Fist Black Panther movie was quite mediocre. Compared to Captain America, & Iron Man films it fell short in all areas despite the really good presence and acting by. Chadwick Boseman. With a not so good presented story and weak secondary characters it left a lot to be desired. But Wakanda Forever is truly truly abysmal like Namor's home world. Male characters appear dumb as hell while female characters all powerful. Wouldn't have a problem with the above if the movie had what it was supposed to. Action and unfortunately it is seriously lacking in this big time. Can't but wonder to whom these new Marvel phase 5 movies are directed. Because it's definitely not comics or action fans. If you like films were the dominant characters are always women. Were movies are filled with desperate moments of leading characters mourning (probably their poor acting skills) then definitely that's the film for you. Otherwise for fans of previous Marvel movies keep hoping that something good will come in the future especially if all these managers get into their thick head to include once again all the elements that made Marvel super hero films what they were to begin with."
1," Another Marvel movie with no heart
",chandan-17014,/user/ur78710328/,18 February 2023,"The move is a one time watch if you can neglect the repeat of Marvel's agenda of propagating their highly debatable political ideas about racism. It's stylish, even though if it's stylish than the previous movies. The action and thrill is much less and emotions are not much convincing. The acting is average. Somehow if they could leave the forceful pushing of political ideologies behind and focus on the movie story, the writing, dialogues and basic movie making techniques which keep the audience have an attachment towards the good guys.The acting is good but the director's vision lacks the focus on concepts like bravery, right and wrong, heroism, some underdog feelings. Rather the movie feels materialistic and another course on how America is bad, white people are bad, human beings except Wakandans are bad.The movie also seems very long. The villain's intentions and goal is not very convincing. Feels more like a drama and less of a super hero movie. Disappointed."
6," Too long, low stakes/tension, too much, and lazy character addition
",lastunicorn985,/user/ur2542272/,18 February 2023,"First of all, I thought the grief and loss parts of the film were well done. I appreciated the moment of silence and that storyline throughout.The scientist character was poorly done. I am not a genius, but from the moment the character said she was late late for her dif-e-q class, I was like, ""wouldn't she have tested out of that class?"" I had a math minor, am not a genius by any means, but that was the ""fun/easy"" course the math majors were taking and what I was learning for fun on Khan academy. The way she talked was not how anyone I know with PhDs do, as rules and things as used to explain why things don't work instead of a ""please excuse my dear aunt sally"" to remember how to do basics. It made it obvious that the writers didn't know what they were talking about and throwing about big words like the character in The Glass Onion (""just stupid""). So, whenever she said anything ""smart"" it was dumb...like diffusion--high school Biology after an introduction of it in previous grades--was a big reveal. Like, and then we breath---wait for it--oxygen. Genius.The tension with the other nation was just not there. The fight scene at the end was boring. Cool gadgets, but why am I bored? There were lots of ways to build up tension, but the movie was bloated and had extra things instead of letting tension and stakes build.It reminded me of the later Pirates movies where the movie relied on effects, telling, and the audience already being bought in than having a tight script with a good build-up and movie.I wanted to like it, but it was meh, and I don't really see myself rewatching it. Parts were well done and good, but other pieces were boring, too long, or felt lazy (like the scientist). So many great actors and actresses are here, doing a great job. I couldn't tell about the new addition of the scientist since the script hindered me believing her to be a genius, which is not her fault.The script and story structure seem to be the biggest problems here. It could have been great."

Absolutely no words for how much a waste of time and energy these films are these days.Only give it 2 starts because I gave Wonder Woman 1984, the unquestionably worst scripted, directed, told and made film of all time, 1 star. Kindest thing I can say is its 1 star better than Wonder Woman.2 hours and 25 minutes of worthless, pointless dialogue and storyline, only to have 5 minutes of action...

6," Emotions over substance
",sujanfaster,/user/ur35235050/,18 February 2023,"It is safe to say MARVEL's content has been pretty underwhelming recently on both big screen and OTTs. I don't have the same energy to hit the theaters anymore when MARVEL's new movie releases. I had my doubts with respect to Wakanda Forever as well, but after hearing about its great tribute to Chadwick Boseman, I went to the cinemas to watch it anyway.The trailer pretty much gives away where the plot is going and also who would be the new Black Panther. The initial T'challa tribute scenes are very heartwarming and also brilliantly shot. The sound design for those scenes is top notch. The plot continues to go around the obvious Vibranium arc afterwards. Despite the ""coming together"" events in Avengers: Endgame, we go back to square 1 where Wakanda is again distancing itself from the power and resource hungry world leaders. The introduction of the antagonist Namor and his tribe brings back the energy up to a certain level. However the film doesn't really justify the acts of Namor and also the battle in the end doesn't really intrigue as much,The characters in this movie carry heavy emotions and they do deliver well especially tying it to T'challa's death. I still believe there could have been something more added to that part of the story. Letitia Wright as Shuri carries herself with ease along with Angela Basset as Ramonda. But I personally feel that Ramonda's role isn't significant enough to grant Basset an oscar nomination for this movie. Tenoch Huerta's intense performance as Namor is definitely a standout and a great introduction for the actor. However, the other characters are not so impactful mainly because of them working with new supporting characters who are introduced in the movie. Although the movie is long, it doesn't provide enough substance to roles of Okoye, M'Baku, Oyo and Namora. Less I said about RiRi is better as I feel it was a very forced and poorly written character. I know that there's future for RiRi's role in the MARVEL universe and will wait to see how it pans out.Wakanda Forever is a weird movie to judge. It has a great tribute to Chadwick, but I don't think the movie itself is one. It is a decent watch for the Black Panther fans but quite a tiresome for the rest."
10," Incredible!
",lenacrowley,/user/ur126777739/,17 February 2023,"This movie has so much emotional, cultural, linguistic and human depth, it's incredible! It's such a mature and beautiful marvel movie and will forever be a movie I cherish.It's long but there's so much too it. As a language nerd, I loved the linguistic diversity and it was a lot of fun to see what I can and cannot understand.As usual, the CGI was amazing and the under water scenes looked stunning. A more serious, mature and sophisticated marvel movie. The diverse cast was the cherry on top and I loved seeing all the different African cultural elements.Just a fantastic movie, I'd give it 20 starts if I could."
7," Maybe a bit too long than it needed to be, but it was decent
",SafReviews,/user/ur93969415/,17 February 2023,"I didn't have high expectations for this movie because of the mixed reviews, but it was actually decent. The plot was probably a Marvel formula plot, but I found it intriguing because it was interesting to see how Wakanda would cope after the death of the Black Panther. I liked the new characters especially the underwater species who made me doubt whether the Wakandans would beat them. I thought the action scenes were good especially the last fight scene which was pretty epic. I hope this is the last Black Panther movie because I think another movie would not turn out good and Marvel seem like they've run out of ideas."
2," The worst marvel movie
",CursedSeal86,/user/ur42393662/,17 February 2023,"Movies with real stories like ""Hidden Figures"" about African americans contribution to science is the standard of empowerment and truth I want to see...not wars over fictional countries hoarding fictional metal/tech. I was disappointed even at the film process as the lighting was terrible in so many scenes and the fight scenes lacked any quality/logic. The blue people made it feel like avatar and silly. The writing is simply forced, contrived, and lacks logic. I did not like ANY of the characters. The only tolerable part is the villain and he is weak and unremarkable. Similar to ""aquaman"" the lesson of under water heroes/ villains being the worst needs to be learned by studios. ""The boys"" tv show even makes fun of this very well. This movie moves the marvel ball very little to a large collab movie when compared the way previous marvel phases built off each other into ""endgame"". 2/10."
3," Didn't Honor The First Movie's Legacy
",ryanperez-22064,/user/ur159679205/,17 February 2023,"I know that Ryan Coogler had to rewrite the script because of Chadwick Boseman's passing but I felt he wasn't given enough time to flesh out the story. The funeral scene was touching and Namor was a great villain though I felt this sequel did disservice to what was established. In the first movie, T'Challa promises the world to share their resources and Vibranium. In the sequel. It's like ""Sorry. We're taking back our Vibranium and keeping Wakanda hidden again"". Also, the movie didn't show how Queen Ramonda and Shuri ran Wakanda after T'Challa's passing. Instead, we get a typical comic book revenge story that doesn't go with what's established from the first movie. Ramonda's death had me almost walk out of the theater since she was just introduced. Using that to make Shuri to become Black Panther was not cool. She should have been inspired and motivated by either T'Challa or her father in the Ancestral Plane. Like what was Shuri's relationship with her father like? Even though he covered the story about his brother and Killmonger, he could have been redeemed to tell Shuri to not make the same mistake he did. Instead, we get Killmonger which I know that was out of fanservice to motivate Shuri to take down Namor. I mean didn't T'Challa tell Shuri that you should never vengeance consume you? In conclusion, there were good and bad choices in the movie. Also, no one applauded when I saw the movie three times. Not even when Shuri wore her Black Panther suit. Guess everyone feels the same way. When I first saw the first movie, I walked out overjoyed seeing a landmark film. With the sequel, I walked out saying ""Did we just lose?"" If this movie was to give us closure after Chadwick Boseman's passing, it midly succeeded. Not like how Endgame gave us closure after we lost our main heroes. I didn't feel healed after watching the movie. Shuri was barely healed and she should have closure after seeing her father or T'Challa in the Ancestral Plane. Then she would have been healed including the audience. I didn't feel lifted by Rhianna's song at the end. It felt like a funeral song. I felt Ryan Coogler messed up his characters and needed to rewrite the script more. He's one of my favorite storytellers but needed some help. Killing off the queen was wrong. You could have put her in a coma. Now, Shuri lost her whole family making the whole film depressing. Like in a way, Namor won. He wanted everything to fall even though he wants Wakanda to be his ally. So, yeah. This film is divisive. It's how I felt about Multiverse of Madness. I know most people didn't like Love and Thunder but at least the movie was fun, straight forward and got you pumped to see more. I walked out of that movie with a smile on my face. Definitely the MCU's finest movies in a while. With Wakanda Forever, I felt flabbergasted and not overjoyed. So, I give it 3 1/2 stars."

7," BETTER THAN EXPECTED
",Hiya_Georgie,/user/ur129215936/,17 February 2023,"I will start by daring to say that beside the parallels between MLK/Malcolm X and T'Challa/Killmonger, i did not enjoy the first Black Panther movie that much, especially the unnecessarily pompous third act and its terrible CGI.In this one, the director seems to have learned from this previous mistake as he used the effects budget wisely. That means he made Wakanda Forever a deeper film, with more dialogue and meaningful interactions between characters.Angela Basset's dynamic performance is breathtaking. It feels like she really carries the whole film. There are also quite a few subtle non-verbal interactions between characters, that channel their thoughts and feelings seamlessly.The costumes were already a strong card of the Black Panther world, but now they ascended in a whole other level. You really can't take your eyes off the colourful designs.Also, i am glad the aesthetic of Wakandans is now much more native African oriented, than African-American. That means less rap and swag, to my relief. It reinforces the antithesis with the brilliant choice of making Namor's people ancient Mayans, as well.The relationship Wakanda forms with the foe kingdom of Talocan, reflects a new relationship that forms with itself, forcing it to look within.Wakanda Forever succeeded all that, after tragically loosing the actor who plays the character with the franchise's name. And doing it respectfully, in top of that. Boseman was a perfect choice for the role and i am glad they didn't recast him.Which brings me to the bad stuff.The successor isn't worthy of the mantle in a lot of ways (morally, physically, emotionally), and it shows. The movie almost winks to the audience, every time it happens. In the first movie, T'Challa almost died and the whole country fell into civil war just to stay impartially consistent to their own rules. But all this is now out of the window. Stuff are now just plate served, just because.The final conflict resolution has a certain reasoning behind it, but the rushed delivery makes it a bit childish.Riri Williams really wasn't necessary, at all. An anonymous character could be in her position and everything would be exactly the same. Not to mention that flying around in the battlefield makes her vulnerable and her whole plot point invalid.It is a personal nitpicking, but it puts me off to see civilisations talk underwater without even air bubbles out of their mouths. Looks lazy filter work, but that maybe is just me.Overall, i had lower expectations for this film, given the circumstances and some impressions from the prequel. But it had me a invested until the very end. If only Chadwick was alive, i would love to see him be a part of it."
2," Endless and mindless CGI action shots stuffed down your throats until you want to upchuck.
",screenact-1,/user/ur9086999/,16 February 2023,"I've finally reached my limit of CGI superhero action movies that have become more and more comical than the comic books that inspired them.Even a subplot designed to give this film a sense of respectable seriousness can save it from being a bloated worn-out showcase for ""superhero"" and ""supervillain"" characters that will beat you over the head with a tsunami of body-bashing and death. Unless, of course, you still are in the embrace of an unthinking, gleeful adolescent fervor for such things.But if that's not the case, then this is a movie that might finally give you an action movie version of GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease, otherwise known as really, really bad acid indigestion - metorphorically speaking).But no Tums will be needed if you have finally grown up and need more to entertain you than over two hours of golly-gee-whiz wham bang explosions and animated headgears that magically appear and disappear from a super whoever's head and grownup smurf-like people possessing feet with little wings that allow them to fly... and you choose to march on and watch something else.But you protest... isn't there a super-serious and angst filled plot running deep within all this mayhem that will require the use of a hanky (to wipe the tears away)?Well, kind of. The only problem being how all the other stuff kind of gets in the way of a good cry. Or maybe not.In the end it's your decision to watch or not watch. But don't say I didn't warn you."
7," Can I split the movie into 2? Loss of a King 7! Rest a 3.
",yollya,/user/ur64663596/,16 February 2023,"The movie was good but what I liked best was the emotional aspect that surrounded the loss of Black Panther (Boseman) outside of that, the plot surrounding Wakanda's enemy was kind of ridiculous. Even with the understanding that you must put your critical thinking aside for a few hours to enjoy the film. It is hard to believe that if the sad passing of Boseman had not happened, the movie would have been good with the Talokan as the main plot. His acting was great but as Marvel enemies go, this was one of the poorest executed. My rating of 7 is for the emotional aspect at the loss of the king of Wakanda, the rest of the movie would have gotten a 3 at best."
8," An incredible tribute to Chadwick
",Mysterygeneration,/user/ur104853183/,16 February 2023,"King T'Challa's statement in the middle of ""Black Panther"" implies that Wakanda has been a superpower for a very long time. Puncturing a meteorite's protective bubble and demonstrating that people are interrelated and that ""better"" can win out was T'Challa's defining act as the king of Wakanda.The movie ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is about the razor-thin margins of success and how T'Challa's passing compels the characters to decide between upholding his father's legacy and reigning independently. Breaking from ""Black Panther's"" solitary identity, ""Wakanda Forever"" introduces the rest of the MCU."
2," Nothing special,boring, one of the worst marvel movie.
",jerryson_e,/user/ur150605568/,16 February 2023,As usual we are back in Wakanda. Where they are far superior than the western world and this movie forces to make everyone understand that. The first Black panther movie didn't deserve an Oscar but it is far better than this one. The movie basically has women leads so automatically critics are praising it. The story wasn't interesting. It's close to unbearable and fails to keep you focused. But they put a bumbling white guy who clearly is submissive to the Wakandans and basically plays a goofball and a stooge so that should probably put this movie on top of most positive lists. Who knows maybe an Oscar or two...
4," Deeply tragic, and deeply confusing
",misterkevinoh,/user/ur27348894/,16 February 2023,"Nothing really holds this film together. While Shuri is defacto protagonist she is not always whom we spend time with. It feels as though the director wants us to care about all of his main characters equally and while that is not uncommon for a film to try and do, I had almost zero interest in the life and times of all of these side characters. This is where the next problem rears it's head in that the film is an ungodly length, without truly the substance to sustain such a runtime. While the avengers films were long they had justified reasoning. Still, the actress for Shuri had much on her shoulders to helm the Black Panther moniker, and should be commended. Namor was a pleasure to watch as well, although disappointing in his final fight."
4," What was the point?
",jimcrighton,/user/ur28953596/,16 February 2023,"What a huge disappointment, the story line was somewhere between non existant and nonsensical. The resolution was too easy to not have been a non starter kin the first place. The acting and effects were great, but showing what you are capable of doing just to spend millions of dollars is not entertainment. The movie as entertainment was one star. To keep the money going into that ever deep pit super hero movies seem to love throwing more fuel into, it seems they have opened the door to try another , I for one think it should end here, because that kind of sucked! Now I have to add thirty four more characters to publish."

Makes no logical sense in many places and the characters make out of character choices.There are deaths that also make no sense. They don't further the story.The CGI is so badly done that unless you are watching on a huge movie theater screen, you cannot make out what is happening on the screen. So if you buy the movie to watch at home you truly are lost as to whom or what you are seeing.A sad/poor sequel to a fantastic and outstanding movie."
8," Well done Marvel!
",becky-92346,/user/ur105136670/,15 February 2023,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) follows the people of Wakanda as they fight to protect their nation after T'Challa's death. It's rare that I'm impressed with Marvel nowadays, but this film is brilliant. It's the perfect tribute to Chadwick Boseman and I'm sure it would've made him very proud.The film has some very unique camerawork and is very well lit, with some super pretty colour schemes. Also, the movie makes good use of slow-motion to add tension to the action sequences. My only solid criticism of the film is that some of the CGI would've benefit from a touch up, which unfortunately is a consistent criticism for the MCU.The score is very well used, and the soundtrack is fun and fitting. The sound mixing is done well too, and the sound design is overall very impressive. I absolutely adore the siren song scene, the sound is so eerie and really helps to build up an unnerving atmosphere.All the performances are great, showing raw emotion, and like the previous film the characters are extremely likeable. The actors have a lot of chemistry with each other and compliment each other on screen perfectly. Okoye is definitely a standout, she's badass and so much fun to watch.The movie does follow the basic Marvel movie structure, but it's still entertaining and well paced, so I don't see this as a big issue. The plot it set up well, and there are so many thrilling moments throughout the duration. As expected, this movie is incredibly emotional, Ramonda's passing is so heartbreaking and the scene is played out well."
3," Dull plot and drawn out
",rgoodbourn,/user/ur152151886/,15 February 2023,"The loss of Chadwick Boseman is definitely felt throughout.Like recent MCU entries, the film feels dull, overlong and lacking a main character to drive the plot forward. It is shame with so many good actors and visuals. Disney and the MCU always fall at this hurdle.The inclusion of secondary plots to build up phase 5 & future characters make it harder to engage with the film. Again it's something Marvel traps themselves in, where they don't make films stand alone from the overall MCU arc phases.Overall you can say Marvel fatigue is setting in with the scripts and direction since Endgame."
2," Too Long and Boring.. Marvel seems lost
",CoolGuy007,/user/ur132667897/,15 February 2023,"So much of hype and what we get a long, boring and not so well connected plot.. bad plot.. too bad that it is no where near the first part.. had high hopes for this but all in vein.. this looks like a movie created without any passion.. characters seems like they are doing whatever is told.. Marvel has lost its touch in the last few years.. this felt unnecessary.. the script seemed like forced into this.. a mixture of Aquaman and Avatar but without any emotions.. was so disappointed after watching this.. Black Panther was so appealing to start.. but u will see the Black Panther only for last half an hour.. Conclusion: don't just go because of the hype.."
4," Boring and total failure
",gogoal1,/user/ur162323073/,15 February 2023,"Marvel's comic book movies have lost their interpretation space since stage 4, as they are becoming less and less like movies and more and more like the comics themselves or live-action versions of the comics.The plot almost looks like written by AI, with constant mechanical sÃ©ances, constant raw twists, constant nonsense, and constant scattered disorder, just like the original comics, just geared towards a teenage audience to make them look funny.The whole film seems to feminize ""Black Panther"" and again with ""Sea King"" and ""Avatar: The Way of Water.The script of ""Black Panther 2"" was grafted.As for the script, the first hour of the film rambles on and on, making it sleepy. What can be told in half an hour is watered down to more than an hour. There are several scenes of armed fighting at the village entrance, but it is not exciting. This hour told a thing, the black sister, Heart of Steel, made the probe ship threaten the Nama clan, so Nama captured and killed her. Then the heart of steel and the princess were arrested together. Only after being caught did the story enter the core drive of the plot, and the dialogue between the princess and Namor made it sound a little confusing. Namor, while talking about killing the Heart of Steel, is to avoid exposure to protect the clan while blackmailing the princess so that Wakanda together to cooperate in the conquest of the land.Take a step back, you united Wakanda to attack land. Even if your underwater village does not expose the location, that war will have to die, ah, the death of your people. And what protective role does this play? There are apparent signs of forced confrontation here, and the princess just finished saying we must find a peaceful solution. Nama immediately turned the conversation and said that this was not important. We have to do it, and you come or not? If you still need to, even you will do it together. If you are so brave, there is still fear of what is exposed. A typical sentence can solve the problem of advancing the plot forcibly blackened after the script follows the ""Spider-Man 3"" three-stage formula, the protagonist, by immaturity, to the side of love of the departure of the blow to complete the growth of a unique side. Here is the only place where ""Black Panther 2"" is better than ""Thor 4""; the protagonist princess has a complete character arc, and the journey of the heart is visible. And unlike Thor, what to do, the director said he had to go. Like a puppet on a string. The mother was killed to become the new Black Panther Shang Ren's turning point, and ""Spider-Man 3"" Green goblin killed Aunt May similarly.Finally, the values conveyed by the plot. We can call it ""the skin of a black man but the heart of a white man."" The West can never get rid of colonialist thinking. When the new Black Panther was ready to kill Namor, he felt the call of Our Lady and said: ""Surrender; we in Wakanda can protect you. Your people can not die. Don't let revenge blind you. Notice a shot of Namor as if he saw his mother when the New Black Panther showed mercy. Absolute! The colonized instantly completed the subjugation. The colonizer becomes like a mother, with kindness and generosity. The mother queen of the two and the Christian trinity of the Holy Mother completed the merging in the new Black Panther. The light of the great love of the world shone so brightly that it touched the evil soul of Namor. He returned peacefully to the embrace of his mother.In general, ""Black Panther 2"" is stronger than the poor ""Eternals,"" ""Thor 4,"" and so on. At least the cause and effect of the plot is still relatively complete, and then some remembrance of Boseman's complex in it."
6," Almost disrespectful
",ethan-49154,/user/ur153092738/,15 February 2023,"I'm a mega marvel fan and loved black panther! It was such a good film and engaging all the way through. This though, it's disrespectful to Chadwick. To start off with, it's boring! I spent most of the film on my phone because it was too boring to even watch.Fair enough, it's pretty important and has some key things so you probably have to watch it. It's a challenge to watch it. The first hour is 8/10 the second is 6/10 and the last 40 minutes were 4/10.There was so much potential and they wasted it over this. I'm really disappointed as I was waiting for this to come on to Disney plus for so long."
4," Very meh...
",Rich-Lee-Bailey,/user/ur129192572/,15 February 2023,"Just didn't have the spark like the first black panther movie. It certainly didn't deserve a stand alone film in my opinion and could have been a 3 part tv show. For comparison, I would have said this was on par with the ms marvel show as that was too very meh.I don't know if it was the directing or just the fact that the female lead just didn't have that certain wow factor. I just personally think the male leads bring more action to the game and being a man that's what I like to see.I found captain marvel was very boring too.If we consider something like Resident evil movies, I found them to very enjoyable. So, it's definitely not the fact that I don't appreciate female lead movies. Perhaps, the chosen actors for leads in majority of marvel movies just don't cut it or the producers don't demand much from them and that's where it lacks; as I imagine they'd push male actors further and get more from them.Anyway, that's my opinion. If I hadn't watched it, I wouldn't have been none the wiser."

",williamblakewright,/user/ur28976254/,15 February 2023,"I am trying hard not to let my biases influence my rating, but I thought they had so much potential using Mayan culture and riding the wave of the marvel system... I would have given it a 3 or 4 if it had not been for a couple awesome scenes and the way they honored Chadwick. But the story as a whole was silly... From my perspective marvel has thus far tried to adhere to some form of reality (not our own of course with Thor and hulk... but adhere to some universe's laws) DC on the other hand, with exception to Batman, just changes the rules every scene, it's impossible to keep up. This show fell into that trap with humming bird wings that can propel a man supersonic to the stratosphere. Beings that can swim through water faster than anything conceivable, water bombs that somehow just create massive amounts of water instantly... anyhow, I felt like Disney let some of the minds behind the marvel universe go and hired some from DC..."
4," It Should Have Been Ramonda
",brittanyfonseca,/user/ur124598287/,15 February 2023,"This film is sadly the result of the passing of Chadwick, and that can't be escaped. The mourning that takes place and the segment of the film devoted to, as I see it, the past (T'Challa) is beautiful, well done, and moving.My issue, however, is with everything about the film that ""looks forward"" to the future of Wakanda. Riri Williams is half introduced and then sort of forgotten for a while. Okoye's story starts out fine but then take a bizarre turn that really upset me.Then there's Shuri. Her arc in this movie is IDENTICAL to T'Challa's in Civil War and it's not a good rehash in anyway. They make no effort to build her into a good choice for BP, all they do is make her the only choice.I think Marvel missed a HUGE opportunity to make Ramonda the new Black Panther. She has the fighting skills as a former Dora, she's intelligent, compelling--and how incredible would it have been to see an older woman, a black woman at that, as one of the most badass superheroes in the world? Shurt could have been left to grow and develop a more 3D character to be BP later.... Alas...."
4," The Universe has lost its way
",leenewham-31033,/user/ur82071219/,14 February 2023,"How all the Marvel films linked together, even when out of sync was an amazing feat. Each one built on deeply fleshed out and defined characters that had story arcs. Recent offerings since the end of the the iron Man Era have been poor, the last decent film being the surprisingly excellent Black Widow and Spiderman 3. The series have been more interesting, such as Loki, Moon Knight and Wandavision. They have done something different and crafted interesting stories that are still true to the characters.How can you continue with the heroes defeat bad guys stick when it's been done time and time again across dozens of films and series?I don't think you can.Wakanda Forever doesn't have a really interesting character at its heart, the baddies aren't really defined, you don't really care about anything or anyone. Would it have been more interesting to go back and fill in timeline gaps rather than carrying on?This may have been a better way to deal with the sad death of Chadwick Boseman. He is sadly missed and carried the first film. But going back in the timeline, like Black Window or some of the excellent animated series in Star Wars, the Manalorian or the excellent Rogue One has been proven to work.These are stories that, if done well (Not you SOLO), work and add stories that engage and make sense. What if they had done the story of the previous Black Panther or go back even further to the origin of discovering Vibranium.Wakanda Forever feels tired, the universe has gone on too long. She Hulk, Dr Strange Into the Multiverse, 10 rings etc were all sub par.It's time for something new. But with Disney digging up ever more remakes and sequels in all of it's brands, they are in danger of forgetting what made all of these brands great in the first place.They were creative, unusual stories that did something new. They were created with passion and vision without an eye for merchandising or the ability to turn bits into games.I think Marvel need to go back to the comics and source material."
6," Yeeeeaaah well

You could totally feel that this was added to the book afterwards.I like the characters, even though they don't really have big developments.The story and main conflict feels very constructed. The motivation of the antagonist is at least incomprehensible. The whole thing is too long. The story around Riri Williams is totally insignificant and only there to involve here into the MCU.The visuals are good but not as great as in the first part. The VFX looks awful at times, for example the background of the ceremony where they dance in the streets in the beginning or the water.Still, one of the more enjoyable MCU-films. All in all, I had a good time."

5," at least costumes were beautiful.
",dklecan,/user/ur18759924/,14 February 2023,"I read somewhere that the costumes were worth the price of admission and I agree. However, I found the entire show boring. And Despite the incredible beauty and performances of the main protagonists, I just couldn't get into this movie.The elaborate story of Namor and the Mayan/Aztec mythology was boring too. All I remember of Namor, as a kid reading comics, was that he was Marvel's meaner version of happy go lucky Aquaman. It lacked charisma, spark, soul, or something and it seemed like the death of TaChalla, Black Panther held a pall over the entire production and no amount of CGI, costumes, performance, etc. Could help it. Maybe humor, smiles, cute comebacks (like other Marvel shows) was needed."
4," mediocre
",saru2020,/user/ur66979966/,14 February 2023,"Not so interesting one and not so bad either, a mediocre kinda one and might be a watch for those who're in the need of tracking the universe of characters kinda films.The underwater sequences with Aquaman kinda film making were beautiful to watch and the new villain with the feathers on his leg was a new addition to the superpowers list but the backstory of that character wasn't so engaging and so probably that's where the film fails, as we've seen in most earlier movies, if the negatively shaded characterization gets well designed then the heroic character also gets that level of makeup and it becomes somewhat interesting to watch but this one fails a bit there only, I suppose.I generally don't like watching the black panther series because I see it more like marketing material to cover those black people and nothing else and this film is another installment of that marketing gimmick by these big film corporations."
7," Not bad, but nothing memorable
",ccredelle,/user/ur160401327/,14 February 2023,"It's hard to know what to expect with marvel movies these days from reading reviews. You either have marvel fanatics who will give every movie a perfect score, or the viewers who are secretly annoyed with super hero films and nitpick everything. I was expecting this to be a complete failure but it was not as bad as the reviews made it out to be. The directors were in a tough place with Chadwick passing. They HAD to make a movie and find some way around it. The tribute to Chad was very well done and I think this movie had one of the best soundtracks of any marvel film. Namor is the antagonist, but he wasn't really the villain. To me they showed that they were just like the Wakandan's and would do anything to protect their home/kingdom; even though the Wakandan's didn't agree with their methods. There isn't really anything wrong with the film, but there was nothing memorable. There were some action scenes that felt like they were copy and pasted from previous marvel films. Overall not a bad film but nothing memorable."
6," Truly disappointing
",chris-b-welch,/user/ur38695714/,14 February 2023,"I love MARVEL, and the initial Black Panther movie was fantastic! Whilst the visuals and actors make this film a 6/10, the storyline just fell short, by a country mile. It doesn't seem to flow, seemed rushed and the ending was just a bit rubbish. I'm gutted. It feels as though there were 2 movies here that have been blended to make a single movie. It's a darned shame really. The Wakandan addition to the MARVEL screen universe opens up so many opportunities for incredible stories and this one, so soon after Chadwick Boseman's passing just lacks 'direction' it feels like it was rushed out rather than put together in good time."
4," Far Too Up Itself. Too Far From Source.
",GalAlba,/user/ur153686186/,13 February 2023,"Too wrapped up in itself. Nonsensical & difficult to follow; except the French are bad?I dunno. Was lost after a few minutes. I can understanding the opening tribute, but the real life loss of Chadwick has been allowed to affect the fantasy resulting in confusion. The script was tripping over itself to tie up loose ends & in doing so created more confusion.There is also the issue of agendas & accessibility. In my opinion, comic book fantasy adaptations shouldn't be geared for a specific race & the Black Panther films are. The Blade trilogy, for example, was about a lead black super hero, but at no time do these films alienate others. They weren't made primarily for an African American audience & the fact the Black Panther films have been is alarming & creepy; especially as they appropriate pseudo sub Saharan culture do so. There's something off about that.Anyway. I'm sure a film adaptation of Black Panther could be done much better, with more warmth. You can't promote Western multiculturalism whilst inflating a story about a single race super country."
7," It has a few flaws
",edgarasstasaitis,/user/ur55657127/,13 February 2023,"The first part of this movie was very good, so I expected ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" to be a very good movie as well. And this movie is good, but if you had to compare the first and second part, it would be really difficult to do so, because both parts are very different, have different stories and both are interesting in their own way.As soon as I started watching this movie, I thought that this movie is really special, because the farewell to the dead king was really touching and impressive, so I immediately knew that the story is going to be interesting and unique.So the second part tells how people fight to protect the kingdom of Wakanda after King T'Challa's death. I really liked that this time it was decided to portray the strength and courage of women in the film. I was very impressed with Angela Bassett and her performance as Queen Ramona, a very strong and convincing performance.It was interesting to watch the history and how things changed. The story about the underwater nation of Talokan and how they were able to breathe underwater thanks to that beautiful plant, but were unable to live above ground was very interesting, so I really liked it, because it was something completely new and unexpected.Sound and visual effects, costume design simply amaze with their uniqueness. The plot of the film itself is good, but there were some weak points and mistakes that needed more work and improvement.Although this movie is completely different from the first part and has a few flaws, I will definitely not deny that the film was still engaging and interesting, so I think that if you liked the first part, it is worth watching the second part as well."
4," Why make a Black Panther sequel, without the Black Panther...
",groundzero-273-397110,/user/ur30812911/,13 February 2023,"Why make a Black Panther sequel, without the Black Panther... This movie is 2 hours and 41 minutes long, which is way too long and painful for this movie. At the 2 hour mark, Shuri finally becomes the new Black Panther. How? By using some sort of stupid machine/3D printer to create a new heart-shaped herb because apparently she is such a genius! Same goes for Riri... How can she construct and build all that stuff, in school? How can she make an arc reactor out of spare parts? Also a genius I guess... Is she the replacement of Iron Man? I hope not! You should not try to replace these iconic cool characters like Black Panther, Iron Man, Captain America etc.Then we have the story, which was so bad. It is very slow and boring. Namor is a super boring villain that made no sense. He blames Wakanda for bringing vibranium to the outside world, but the outside world already knew about vibranium? What about Captain America's shield for instance? That was in 1942... We never got an explaination either to why Namor's people could survive fatal wounds.The characters are also very boring, and most of the characters feel like the same character. No one really stands out.The dialogue is really bad from time to time. The few moments in this movie where it tried to be funny and bring some comedy, it was just super cringe... Like the jokes about Okoye's makeup...Some action scenes were good, but some also very stupid. For example, when Riri shoots down that drone that manage to crash exactly on the police barricade, and she then talks like she planned it. Come on...And then we have the ending... The final fight... Namor's people manage to sabotage the Wakandan ship from underneath, and it starts to tilt and sink like the Titanic, but then all of a sudden it's upright again and nothing happens to it? Eh what? The final fight between Shuri and Namor was the worst ending fight ever in a Marvel movie so far. Namor impales Shuri with a spear, and at first I thought she actually might die, and I would have like that because that would have been unexpected. But no, she somehow recovers very quickly and manage to defeat Namor with little effort...The movie also exploited the death of T'Challa and used it way too often. It was nice and heartwarming to see the tribute to Chadwick Boseman in the beginning of the film, and also perhaps in the end, and they should have left it at that!Finally this phase is over, which in my opinion was the weakest phase so far. I really hope that the next phase will be better.One of the worst Marvel movies so far. I'll give Black Panther: Wakanda Forever a 4/10..."

3," Underwhelming Superhero flick with an identity crisis
",kuner-59029,/user/ur59761418/,13 February 2023,"With the tragically early death of lead actor Chadwick Bosman, the inevitable sequel to Black Panther could not move ahead as planned. Perhaps it would have been better to scrap it alltogether. On one hand, movies are a business, and after the stellar success of the first, the studio naturally wanted a sequel. An argument can also be made for working a eulogy into the movie an honoring the actor and character this way. On the other hand, working a real life death into a silly Marvel superhero action comedy is nearly impossible to pull off without feeling either tacked on or exploitative. To Marvel's credit, they avoided the latter. The tribute to Bosman felt respectful.It did, however, feel tacked on to a movie that never finds a tonal footing. We go from somber tragedy to silly over the top action and jokes to politics to cgi crapfest. Unlike the first film, which was tonally consistent except for the terribly made monorail fight, the sequel never knows what it wants to be. It feels like the studio was too afraid to do an actual serious, sombre Marvel movie, but also afraid of going too comedic, aka Thor Love and Thunder.They also left very little room for the antagonists, who remain not just underdeveloped but generally aren't very interesting or memorable. A superhero movie stands and falls with its villains, and Wakanda Forever's villains may be the worst ones yet in a Marvel film (yes, worse than Thor 2).Remember the days when Marvel would cast grizzled veteran actors as primary antagonists? Jeff Bridges, Mickey Rourke, Tim Roth, Kurt Russel, Guy Pierce, etc? They lent a certain level of gravitas to an otherwise forgettable villain. With these newer Marvel films, it's more about giant cartoon physics fights between CGI armies.It's predictable and underwhelming. To date, Marvel Phase 4 hasn't had a good film. They're heading straight for the same ice berg that sank Star Wars."
6," A bit too much...
",peterk727,/user/ur11344732/,13 February 2023,"This movie is entertaining, great special effects, but the storyline is anti-American. There are far too many political statements in what is supposed to be a family movie .... well, sort of. The US is the bad guy, referred to as a colonizer and portrayed in a bad light. Of course, the heroine is a 19-year-old black woman who is the smartest person on the planet. Although allegedly brilliant, they make her sound like an poorly educated person from an inner-city. In one annoying scene, she is charging less intelligent students a fee for helping them with their papers, and of course none are black. The humorous part is all Wakandans speak with an accent except Killmonger, who is from Wakanda as noted in the actual Marvel comics. Yet, he speaks without a Wakandan accent and more like he is from some east coast inner-city. Entertaining but if this movie was a person, you would say it is full of itself."

4," Very disappointing
",hsjansz,/user/ur124852866/,13 February 2023,"What a disappointment! The story is weak and even silly at times, resulting in an overlong film. And the casting for Namor was also disappointing. A metal rod through his nostrils - where did that come from? I understand the 'Aztec' angle but would have preferred the original Atlantean storyline. Mr Coogler seems to have missed his footing, sadly. The first movie was terrific which makes the disappointment even greater. Recasting the Black Panther role would likely have given us a much better movie. The dialogue is poor and there's too much of it. The action sequences are good and that's all there is really. No doubt some people may like it but it's a very juvenile and predictable film."

This movie hobbled along for 1 hour too long on the crutch of a real life, talented actor dying. (RIP Chadwick, you deserved better). The only interesting character was Namor and maybe the Queen. Everyone else felt flat.Sloppy, long story with an unconvincing plot. While I've always believed the original black panther movie was overrated (mostly because the last 1/4 falls apart) it didn't deserve to be followed up by this money tug at people's hearts.As many other reviews stated it's like the editing department took a vacation on this one. They tried desperately to make us care but all I could do is look at the time and think how could there possibly be another hour and a half of this!MCU needs to get their act together.

The acting, the cinematography, the special effects, were all spot on.Reviewers said it was too long, too slow, and I did not have that experience. I wish it had been longer. The film has to be watched with the expectations of what it is, just pure entertainment. I was hooked within the first 2 minutes of this film, and I could watch it again.The tributes to Chadwick Boseman were heartwarming. He deserved to be recognized for his talents and he was.I hope the Wakanda franchise continues, the best ever!"
1," Yawn
",BillyNoMates1776,/user/ur29295654/,12 February 2023,"Chadwick Boseman was sorely missed! To be honest, I wish I enjoyed it, but I did not. Not. One. Bit.The quality of Marvel films has been nosediving since 2019 & I did not have much expectation.The movie drags on & sadly had me in the doldrums.Disney - not Marvel - are ruining the MCU! They tried to cover too much ground by introducing too many characters & a complicated story.To sum up, save yourself time & money ... don't watch it. I thought the new Thor movie was the worst Marvel could produce via Disney, however I was dead wrong!PS: The moving tribute to Paul Walker in the Fast & Furious film did a better job more than this film does to Chadwick Boseman."
3," Mediocre
",saptezsapte,/user/ur162265527/,12 February 2023,"Mediocre at best, full of current clichés, you can't get emotionally attached to the story or the actors, a pile of illogical data. The Oscars are piling up to give awards for increasingly weak films. A too long and boring movie, honestly, not quite as bad as Black Adam, but close. Good CGI, cute costumes, silly story. Maybe a story that takes into account the realities as an accepted consequence of history, not as cheap propaganda, would really help movies like this. I, for one, am a bit bored. As I said, the story doesn't even help the cause, it just sometimes becomes annoyingly repetitive in promoting some political ideas that are absolutely out of step with reality. The fun part was stripped out, shadowed by propaganda."
9," Loved it
",lisaholtborg,/user/ur161170745/,12 February 2023,"The movie itself was pretty good, but I do agree that it could've been better. I didn't really like how shuri was in this movie. She was annoying and overrated. I didn't like how she reacted and handled things. I also don't like the actor so much. But I loved talokan, namor and the Mayan people a lot. The stories behind them are phenomenal. The CGI was pretty cool too. Talokan and the music was breathtaking. I feel like talokan was a pretty good representation on how the lost city could look like. This should've been Namors movie tho and not Shuris. So far namor is one of the most charismatic anti hero. Overall I do recommend you to watch the movie."
5," Just an average movie
",eversmilee,/user/ur95758956/,12 February 2023,"Wakanda Forever movie is just an average movie.Black panther 1 is way more epic and better than wakanda forever movie.For CGI,
CGI is just normal.In movie scenes,
Fight scenes are just average and no epic fight scenes.Iron heart suit is childish.Creation and development of that suit is so rushed.For my own opinion, Shuri is not fit for the role of black panther.The war between wakanda soldiers and talokan soldiers is funny. Just 100 soldiers on each sides are fighting like vikings.Plot
Plot is not so good and just boring without any twists and epics.Music tracks
Background music tracks are just average and not interesting.Final opinion
Just an below average marvel movie for my opinion."
6," Dark, dark, dark...
",stafheyndrickx-490-681654,/user/ur36727861/,12 February 2023,"This latest Marvel movie might be literally the darkest movie of the entire series. And I mean that a lot of the scenes are practically unwatchable. The tone of the movie is of course also dark, and the main topic seems to be loss and deaths... It is however a perfectly fine tribute to the not so long ago deceased Black Panther main lead, Chadwick Boseman. The plot and story though are a bit of a mess, and none of the actual leads can carry this movie without Chadwick Boseman, which is a particularly heavy task, seeing as the movie is overly long.... I did watch the entire movie, but was actually a little bored and certainly will not for a second time."
3," Has nothing about it to justify an almost 3 hour run time
",jtindahouse,/user/ur3793011/,12 February 2023,"What defines a superhero movie? When you try to recall a particular Batman movie, do you try and think back on what Batman's arc was in that film? Of course not, you think back to who the villain was. The biggest problem I had in 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' (and in a lot of MCU movies) is that the villains are so forgettable. They never have interesting traits or much to make them unique. They're just the same villain copy and pasted time and time again.I struggled with this film. It's unnecessarily long at 2 hours 41 minutes. To justify a run time like that you have to have incredible pacing and some truly great action sequences. This film had neither of those. There's a lot of talking, none of it interesting, and I can't remember a single action scene from the movie that was notable.There's not much good here at all. The film doesn't have a superhero (or at least it doesn't feel like it does), the story isn't interesting and the villain is style over substance and straight from the cookie cutter. This was not an enjoyable watch. A generous 3/10."
7," Not as good as the original
",wfccpwws,/user/ur160363853/,12 February 2023,"It was pretty good but I didn't like the bad guy. He was just weird because he had wings on his shoes which was very weird. And it was unnecessary because Chadwick Boseman died so their really wasn't any point of making a sequel. They should had just kept it with the one movie. But what I did like about it was that they made it so that there still was a BLACK PANTHER in the avengers. It was sad because now Shuri is the only one in the family. The suit is okay though, I like how it is gold like Kilmonger's suit. My mum didn't like how okoye wasn't in the movie for that long. Now you can see that I am a child writing the review."
9," One of THE BEST Marvel films.
",MandalBros-5,/user/ur100201738/,12 February 2023,"Wakanda Forever has everything what was missing in last few Marvel projects. It has pure emotion, perfect characters development, amazing visuals & action sequences and a very strong villain. Tenoch Huerta Mejía as Namor and Angela Bassett as Queen acted brilliantly. I didn't like the Queen character that much in previous films. But, here the character was portrayed so well that I felt for her.Good to see the nice introduction of Riri Williams, looking forward to see her in IronHeart as there's so many things which has not been revealed yet. Lastly, without any doubt this is one of the best Marvel films of all time.Available on Disney+ Hotstar.© MandalBros."
3," The movie is weak, even if you don't have expectations for it!
",yavorberov-21161,/user/ur78098698/,12 February 2023,"It is foolish to have expectations of things that are beyond your control. That's why I watch the movies without expectations to enjoy without disappointments.The film did not cause any positive impressions. The script and story are weak. The antagonist evokes more sympathy than the positive characters.This movie relies heavily on the sadness of Chadwick Boseman. Only Angela Bassett had any strong moments in the movie. I don't know what a great actor like Martin Freeman is doing in a movie like this?Another box office filler with a huge budget and zero content. The movie was made for kids?! But I'd rather play on my own, a stupid movie like ""Dumb and Dumber"", than a pseudo movie like this."
2," Worst marvel movie ever
",djprotege-77076,/user/ur105129684/,12 February 2023,"By far the worst and most boring, convoluted marvel movie that will ever be made. Stick to the proven formula marvel. It was just boring as anything you've watched lately. I myself couldn't get into it. I found myself like 4 times in the first half hour having to start over because I was falling asleep. Then I didn't even want to watch because the beginning was so slow and stupid. After the 20 some hits they made I will of course watch the next one, but one more like this and I will find myself no longer interested in phase 3 or whatever they are calling it. I was excited for phase 3? But after infinity wars and losing some cast, I was worried. Now I see why."
8," It was pretty good
",richardtfrey,/user/ur110747143/,12 February 2023,"I wasn't going in with high expectations, especially since a lot of phase 4 movies and shows were either mediocre or bad except for a couple movies I thought were pretty good. But I was really surprised that I thought it was a pretty good movie. I thought they did a pretty good job at honoring Chadwick and how they handled T'Challas passing. And I thought the actors were really good, I wish they would have stuck closer to the comics though for Namor but he did a really good job also. I also think that they shouldn't have called Marty Freeman colonizer seeing how he helped them in the last one and was helping them in this one, he was their friend and you don't call your friend bad names."
7," Where's T'Challa?
",ThunderKing6,/user/ur71305899/,12 February 2023,"No doubt this movie was a major step up from Black Panther 1. Which is an easy feat.This review has been written on February 11, 2023.About: Peaceful, mature, well establish Water People aim to protect their home from the ruthless, immature, self-inflicting ground dwellers. Wakanda gets in the middle of the war.Story and Production: A better, developed and quality story than Black Panther 1. Cgi in some places still struggles.MCU use to be organic with their makeup and henchmen. In this film, they've gone the lazy route. The Blue water people don't look too good.They took their time with this film, it doesn't feel rushed like previous MCU installment.Some parts remind me of scenes and quotes from THOR films.Genre: Superhero, Politics, FantasySoundtrack: Fine. I assumed it would have been filled with rap music *rolls eyes*Villain: Just like with Killmonger. Aqua... I mean Namor isn't really a villain. He means well, but ignorant people are in his way. Namor really isn't different from many heroes when you think about it. All he wants is Peace. Though, ignorant people are in the way.Highlight: When Shuri said ""Madness"" because it reminded me when Loki said it to the Mighty Thor. Coincidently both were sitting on steps when they stated it.Elaine, and she looks horrible. She looked very frail. I've been watching Seinfeld clips, and it's weird seeing Elaine in the MCU universe.Laugh Meter: 1. Shocking to see an MCU movie take itself seriously.Is this movie worthy?: For a couple of months. Too many drawn out scenes and not enough action or scenes that make me want to rewatch this.What can be learned?: Recast T'Challa.Should you watch this? Sure. Still, Love and Thunder was a more fun movie. The most fun movie of phase 4,"
5," A poor effort
",grapes786,/user/ur19940069/,12 February 2023,"After such an epic on the first outing.I did not expect this to be so badly paced. It lacked intensity, a lack of editing skills made this feel like self obsessed directors cut.The void left by Michael Jordan's intensity and Chadwick Bosemans brilliant presence was felt throughout the movie. The lack of strong male role models was somewhat concerning for me and started to make the movie feel like it had political under tones to it.This movie signals a troubling time for the Marvel universe as it appears to struggle to find its way. Let's hope they manage to get it together, I think the introduction of the X-Men may be the only thing that could work as a well needed centre piece of their universe, the quicker they build up to X-Men the better."

But in this movie? All I wanted was for it to be over and move on.I'm not looking forward for the next black panther movie that's for sure..

6," Suffered the same issues as the first one...
",davidoclough,/user/ur95741917/,11 February 2023,"The bad guys weren't bad. They had sound rationale for their frustrations. Easy to empathise with them. The good guys lacked diplomacy and resorted to ""my guns are bigger than yours"" violence. Basically weak and juvenile for a society that claims some kind of moral high ground to their advanced technology.I had exactly the same feelings with the first Black Panther.It was sad they just had to fight it out. I didn't really care who won. They were all acting arrogant and self righteous. Not sure what they greater good was. They've totally lost sight of that. It was all just really misguided.Perhaps there's an Uncle Ben lesson that the new gen of marvel writers need to learn from.. something about great power and responsibility, ya know. They all needed to grow up."
4," Wakanda Forever was a huge let down
",and_shove_it_up_your_butt,/user/ur17894806/,11 February 2023,"Can't tell you how patiently I waited to watch this movie only to be let down from almost start to finish. My only explanation for why WF was so bad is because the impact and legacy Chadwick left us with is very hard to surpass.Just about every part of the movie was either pointless, made zero sense, or was uninspiring. Why was Elaine Benes in the movie? Why did she have the typical ""bad girl"" streak in her hair? Why was the story ALL OVER THE FRIGGIN PLACE!?! Why did the cgi look terrible? Why was some of the audio in the movie tinny, like they were talking into a tin can? Why did it look like some of the scenes were filmed in a swimming pool? Why were the action scenes so action-less? Why is Shuri totally unbelievable as the next BP? Letitia is a great actress but she isn't a good fit. It's too unbelievable based on just her body alone. I know the actors all did the best they could but I feel like Disney/Marvel failed them and failed us too.For most Marvel movies I'm on the edge of my seat and don't want it to end. For Wakanda Forever as well as the last Thor, Dr. Strange, The Eternals and something else that I'm forgetting, I was not entertained and instead left feeling disappointed. This next phase of Marvel sucks. Not worth holding onto my Disney+ sub at this point."
5," Ironman meets Avatar
",pwatm,/user/ur4244655/,11 February 2023,"Again, Hollywood and Marvel have forgotten that the most important part is the story. Spending so much on special effects and CGI and using writers they found at the local store. Please please spend more time and money getting the story and let that lead, not the CGI. So much is included ""because we can"" not because it adds to the story. Spend more time and effort developing characters you can care about. This was so predictable you saw the end after about ten minutes. The only reason I have this a five was the way they dealt with the loss of Chadwick. Worth a watch, but could have been so much better."
7," Nice bridge movie.
",cloliver864,/user/ur53468545/,11 February 2023,"Although not as good as the first one, this movie stands pretty well on its own. Once you watch the ENTIRE movie (hint) you will understand that this movie serves as a bridge to say goodbye to Chad while introducing us to the future of the Black Panther character.Not a whole lot of action but there was some terrific acting mainly by Angela Bassett with solid performances from the rest of the cast. I liked the actor who played Namor and I'm becoming more and more of a fan of Winston Duke. Mr Duke has the rare ability to be both an action and comedy performer.Director Coogler had a very difficult task in directing this movie knowing that there would be a lot of real emotions from the fans on how they dealt with the passing of Chad. I think he handled this perfectly in my opinion. At the end of the day there is nothing you can write in a script to replace Chad.In summary, solid Marvel movie with great acting and BEAUTIFUL cinematography and musical score. Looking forward to what adventures await the Black Panther in the future."
8," One of the more emotional MCU films
",MovieWarfare,/user/ur112855274/,11 February 2023,"I enjoyed the first Black Panther film and loved Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa. I was looking forward to seeing him more in the MCU which is why his passing was heartbreaking. The sequel then had a tough choice on whether to recast T'Challa or not. Marvel Studios decided to go down the route of not recasting him which I understand but was a little disappointed by. I love the character of T'Challa and having his journey in the MCU end so prematurely was slightly saddening. Did Ryan Coogler make the right choice, or was this an unfortunate misstep?I have to say that this is indeed one of the most emotional and mature Marvel films in a long time. The choice to have T'Challa killed off is handled with the utmost respect and care within the story. Shuri is the main central character and the emotional core is about her grief with her brother's death. The story does a phenomenal job of illustrating her emotional journey which is deep and compelling. We also get to see how other characters handle the passing such as Ramonda and their way of handling grief which is different from Shuri. I appreciated that as people do indeed handle grief differently. One issue with MCU movies lately is the overabundance of comedy. Thankfully, this movie does not do that and for the most part, is a very serious movie. The beginning and ending are wonderfully done as well and are not typical of Marvel.It is clear that Chadwick's passing affected the actors as their performance is stunning. Letitia Wright gives a vastly different performance as Shuri that shows the pain and anger of her loss. Danai Gurira also delivers a great performance as Okoye and Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia respectively. Winston Duke returns as M'Baku and is still more or less the funny character but there are some great moments of serious from him that I love. Tenoch Huerta MejÃ­a is the antagonist Namor, King of the underwater country Talokan, and I think he does a great job. He is fearsome and royal but his performance is quite charming with some heart. The biggest performance standout comes from Angela Bassett as Ramonda. Her performance is phenomenal! I am not surprised she got the best supporting actress because it is that good.On that note, I really like that Talokan does not look like Atlantis from Aquaman (2019). The design is more traditional and inspired by Mesoamerican which is a great choice. Ludwig GÃ¶ransson returns to compose the soundtrack and he just continues to do a brilliant job. There is a scene where it is about exploring Talokan which sticks in my mind because of the great design and the amazing music score. In terms of action scenes, there is a pretty enjoyable car chase near the beginning that I liked.However, that is the only action scene I enjoyed. One thing this film does not do as well is the action scenes. The first issue is that there aren't a lot of action scenes and the second is that every action scene after the car chase is not entertaining. The choreography is not as well done and the final fight is just dull. The final fight is also logically baffling tactically as it felt like an incredibly silly and dumb plan. The movie just lacked a lot of triumphant moments that would make you cheer. It doesn't help that this movie is an incredibly slow burner with it taking a while for things to happen. The movie is really long at 160 minutes as well and it didn't even need to be. The movie could cut 20 minutes of its runtime and most of the core story stays the same.In terms of story, they try to incorporate the idea of other countries going for Vibranium ever since T'Challa opened Wakanda to the world. I don't think they do a good job at this as it felt distracting from the main conflict. Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) returns from the first film and Valentina (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) returns from other Marvel projects. However, their incorporation into the plot is forced and doesn't add to the main narrative. One issue I have with Phase 4 of MCU is this running theme of kids being hunted down by bad guys. It happened in Doctor Strange 2 and Hawkeye but also here in Wakanda forever with Riri Williams being hunted by Namor. It's it flame as it feels like it was done to give Riri a TV series rather than being an integral character plot-wise. I also don't think the film does a good job of showing how Talokan is a huge threat. Their tech feels minimal compared to Wakanda so it is hard to believe that Wakanda would struggle against them.Overall, Ryan Coogler handled this wonderfully. He treated the passing of Chadwick with the utmost respect, and I got to admire that. I don't think this movie is as good as the first one but it is definitely one of the more emotional ones. I'm not sure what direction Black Panther can go in now but whatever it is, I hope it retains the mature take of Wakanda Forever."
7," Good, but not great.
",seanosull-71029,/user/ur159248266/,11 February 2023,"Most of the Phase 4 Marvel material has been pretty lackluster, but I do think that this movie ended it on a good note. The movie isn't amazing, but it is good in some parts. The main thing that drags it down is its run time. 2 and half hours is way too long for a story like this. The movie had many slow moments, especially with the Takolan people that didn't need to be there. I do think that the grief in the movie was perfect, and an improvement since the past. The villain is very conflicting, and I still don't get why he decided war so quickly. Shuri's performace was stunning, and honestly she was just as good as Chadwick Boseman, god bless his soul. The side characters needed more screen time, and the Queen's death felt unnecessary and just felt like a way to get Shuri to hate Namor more, and have a reason to kill him. In a nutshell, the movie is good, but it's run time and slower moments bring it down a bit."

Which they absolutely nailed through this long fun movie.I wasn't optimistic about the idea of making a new Black Panther movie, without T'Challa, the only black panther we consider . However, this was definitely the best way to make such as a movie .The ending was very open to new possibilities, it's kind of scary but they gave themselves a space to consider making more movies in Wakanda.The amazing water environment in this movie and visuals in general were stunning , I'm not going to compare it to ""Avatar: the way of water"" once again because I haven't seen it yet and this movie's visuals and production design are astonishing anyway, but the spotlight for me were the soundtracks that were unbelievable , I loved themAngela Bassett's performance was indeed remarkable, as everyone else did a good job, the villain this time was different than what we used to see, but he was fine overall ."

",leirozdavid,/user/ur162216456/,11 February 2023,"""Wakanda Forever"" is the much-anticipated sequel to the 2018 blockbuster ""Black Panther."" While the film has a talented cast and visually stunning landscapes, it falls short in terms of delivering a compelling story.The film tries to honor the legacy of the original by incorporating elements from the comic book source material, but unfortunately, it lacks the cohesiveness and emotional depth that made ""Black Panther"" so special. The characters, who were once well-defined and dynamic, now seem to be mere caricatures of themselves, lacking any real motivation or development.Furthermore, the film's pacing is slow and uneven, with several long and dull action scenes that fail to capture the excitement and energy of the first film. The film also tries to juggle too many subplots, making it difficult to focus on any one in particular.In conclusion, ""Wakanda Forever"" is a disappointing follow-up to ""Black Panther"" that fails to live up to its predecessor's standards. While it may appeal to fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it fails to deliver the same impact and excitement as the first film."
5," Ok. But incredibly villains are just laughable
",andrew_clure,/user/ur31768110/,11 February 2023,"Not as good as the first, like most sequels. Could have been better. Unfortunately it's just annoying and baffling mostly. Not the plot, that's simple, but baffling as to what happens in the story. The villain is simply annoying, considering he's a few hundred years old seems to be more psychotic than Hitler & Putin combined. You'd have thought he'd be a little wiser.Like all villains he's evil. But he just seems laughable with his little flying feet and green speedos? Come on! It's just looks weird. Like Peter Pan bouncing across the screen. Add in
spwcial effects from 80s TV and it all ends up being lughable. The backdrops look like old school green screen. Really poor. As for Peter Pan jumping about the screen... come on.And why would anyone show Pyscho Speedo Peter Pan mercy? The guy wanted to murder 8bn people, yet ""it's ok we'll let you carry on and we'll live in peace... so I can feel superior..""Around the middle of the story, the Wakandan's seem to have a pretty effective weapon in the form of a sonic gun. That killed two of them really easily, yet none of the wakandans take this super effective weapon with them when they go to war. Instead they resort to spears that they know are ineffective. Why? Makes no sense.So, it's ok. But story just seems to make no sense and not at all logical."

I had to force myself to watch the movie till the end and it was such a drag... Nothing happens for 90% of this movie... It was an underwhelming version of Avatar 2 poorly directed, acted and had no purpose to exist in the first place.Even Angela Basset's performance is overrated.

",juliwiegmannfmg,/user/ur162206973/,11 February 2023,"A great cinematic experience. It's unbelievable how Ryan Coogler managed to make the impossible possible. He made us miss Chadwick Boseman but still feel his presence in this movie. The movie is emotional, the story is well told and I think Namor is a great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and he was introduced in a great way. Great pictures, fantastic worlds and some funny scenes.Going into the movie I actually thought somebody else was going to end up being the new black panther. I can live with the director's decision here, it clearly makes sense.It hurt me personally as a woman to see the actress Letitia Wright look so thin at the end of the movie, but that does not have anything to do with my movie rating at all, I just wanted to mention it. I hope she is alright. I love her as an actress."

Wakanda gets to defend its territory and civilization from the outside world in the first movie but they could care less about the Talokans defending its territory and civilization from the outside world? Completely hypocritical. The Wakandas have the right to exist but the Talokans dont? Especially when the Talokans ALSO have vibranium that the outside world could get a hold of and weaponize. So Wakanda gets to defend their vibranium and keep their civilization safe but its okay for the Talokan civilization to be destroyed so the outside world can get a hold of THEIR vibranium. So stupid. The Queens death is completely on themselves. If they had just listened to the Namor and joined forces they could have helped protect each others civilization and each others vibranium. The writers are trying to make the Wakandans look like good people in this movie but all it shows is they are not good people at all in this movie and complete hypocrites.

Just like when you see first scene, you can totally imagine the next three scenes. Hero needs growing up, allies need to shoulder to shoulder, but this process is just too simple and easy.Next black panther's duty? Yes I see it, and I can see Shuri's hesitation. But where's the Nakia and Okoye and others? They just show up and finish the mission, and their duty is done. The script is like a child story-a common and boring assembly-line product.BTW the character design is definitely bad.

",tavives,/user/ur9274996/,11 February 2023,"I can't watch this movie without dissolving into tears. In addition to the sadness and grief that permeates the movie due to Chadwick Boseman's completely untimely and tragic death, I can't get beyond the thoughts of how difficult this movie must've been for everybody involved in it. I watch the images of grief and it's impossible to separate the actors from the characters they are portraying. No, it's not a perfect movie and there are story problems, but on an emotional level, it accomplishes something that few movies can. It draws me in and affects me on a deeply emotional and deeply personal level. And that's what the best movies do. While I can't give it a 10 out of 10 rating, this movie demands a solid 9 out of 10."

",ErangaPerera,/user/ur112623145/,11 February 2023,"Its a plain popcorn movie, a black Barbie movie with ton of glitter and sprinkles, said that my two girls still disliked it and walked out, standing on the shoulders of Angela Basset and Tenoch Huerta, they have massacred the image of the Black Panther and Chadwic, well Marvel has started digging their own graves as of late, movies with no heart in it drown and are forgotten, its watchable that doesn't say i will watch it ever again, Good bye Wakanda Forever. There is some merit in costume and stage design, what i couldn't understand is the way the industry is looking at these movies in a carnival ride perspective, smouldering action scenes that does not give any emotionally value, what a waste of talent and money.........Poor Story.... Poor acting by most.....poor fireworks(have tried).....Poor Charisma....overdone the female characters.... POOR big budget movie....hope it recovers its investment!"
10," Such an amazing movie.
",dwilson-51705,/user/ur158023948/,11 February 2023,This movie felt more relatable and more real. But in saying that there were quite a few things thay felt rushed and not thought out. Especially relating to Shuri becoming black panther. Also it would have been cool to see how the talokan people got into wakanda. Yes i get it underwater buy it would've been cool to see. Also theres a deleted scene that they definitely should've included. But iove this movie. I hate director de fontaine. I really hope theres another black panther movie in the works that would be exciting to watch. Or maybe make movie about Nakia she is a spy after all.WAKANDA FOREVER!
6," A step in the right direction
",lfpsmith,/user/ur150125855/,11 February 2023,"This movie was always going to be a difficult one for Marvel after the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman in 2020. However, I do think they did a good job ending phase 4 in a more encouraging and fitting way to what we've had over the last few years.The good:
For once the CGI was up to standard with the fight scenes - as always - very entertaining. A compelling villain, although maybe not used to it's full potential, contributes to the story well.Another brilliant score with the use of silence interestingly contributes massively to the key moments of the story in a good way.The death of Chadwick Boseman is dealt with in a really good way right at the beginning of the movie with the Marvel logos featuring just him rather than the rest of the MCU's cast.Shuri fits the role of the Panther well despite the changes made to her character in this film, influenced by the deaths of her family members. Emotional sequences are executed really well throughout the movie which is probably where it is at it's best. The movie is really good and I when it properly focuses in on Namor and explains the villains point of view and why he's doing what he is. A decent ending as well rounds out phase 4 strongly.The bad:
The film was strong enough to possibly be a 7 or 8 heading into the third act and final battle. Everything had been set up well for a dramatic final duel to round out what would have been a really strong addition to the Marvel franchise.However, it did not end up going like that. It seems forced that the rest of the cast had to be far away from the main protagonist and antagonist that it feels unnatural. Shuri and Namor's battle is a decent spectacle but just seems forced towards the end with them both getting hurt and then deciding to make up and be allies.Shuri gets stabbed through the stomach and basically just walks it off as if it didn't happen.Although Nemor gets a lot of development in the middle section of the story he still almost feels underused while Shuri's personality frequently switches scene by scene. The movie could have easily been half an hour shorter due to all the unneeded content packed in to an already long enough film.But still a decent movie, however a disappointing final battle let's it down and drops the score by a couple of points. Overall though a step in the right direction for Marvel as they head into phase 5, a critical point for the future of the MCU after a disappointing phase 4.A good movie but still not back to their own high standards quite yet.6 / 10."
5," The operative word is forever and ever and ever........
",elhonig-902-129896,/user/ur50041975/,11 February 2023,"This needn't have been a sort of bad movie. The main problem as I see it was the length - more than 2 and a half hours. I think this suffered from too little editing. Cutting it maybe a half hour or 45minutes would have tightened up the story and hopefully eliminated the crap, and maybe left us a better movie. I was disappointed that the script was so weak. Angela Bassett was a stand out in all her scenes - no surprise there - but her fellow actors were kind of left in the dust. Unfortunately, the film makers tried to prop up the film with some CGI, but it fell flat. My opinion - best part of the film was the beginning memorial to Chadwick Boseman. Wakanda Forever suffered greatly from the lack of his presence. With Chadwick I believe this might have been a much more compelling film."

",cavsfan0225,/user/ur48384852/,11 February 2023,"I saw this in theaters on opening weekend and rewatched it on Disney+...I appreciate the movie and what they accomplished even more than when I saw it the first time. What they were able to achieve without the lead actor from the first film is spectacular. It's a journey of grieving and acceptance. The actors do a fantastic job, and you can feel the genuine emotions throughout the film. Shuri's character in particular grows the most since the first film. And Angela Bassett...what can I say? Amazing performance as the Queen...award worthy. Loved this movie as much if not more than the first. One of the underrated gems of 2022."
4," Fun action but lame story
",purplepeoplepleaser,/user/ur99014789/,10 February 2023,"The MacGuffin in this movie is a college girl invents a device that makes some sea horses mad. They want to kill her, Wakanda suggests they don't. Then it's 2hrs of nice CGI. It's ok relative to the low-bar of Marvel action movies, but it's far far worse than the first Black Panther movie.In the first half-hour I thought they were going to comment on imperialism. Western powers have ransacked Africa for centuries, now they are coming for vibranium. But they dropped that storyline quickly to introduce Namor. I suppose Wakanda destroying a US naval fleet wouldn't sell as many tickets.I almost went to the theater to see this because I liked the first Black Panther movie. I'm glad I didn't. Streamed it on Disney while doing laundry."
6," A Part Of Me Really Feels Like This Would've Been Better With A Recast
",Owen_Watches_Everything,/user/ur162106551/,10 February 2023,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever succeeds in doing the one thing that was it's most important job: honoring the legacy of the late great Chadwick Boseman. This film was delt just a terrible hand in his tragic passing and had absolutely every right to just flat out cancel the movie but the director and the cast still went forward and made it and I respect that level of passion. The opening scene does a great job connecting the audience with the story the film wants to tell and the ending and post credits scene were also very well done.Is honoring Mr Boseman the only thing this film does that's great? Besides the nation of Talokan being somewhat cool in its history and design and some of the absolute best acting the entire MCU has to offer, honestly yes. Shuri is not an interesting character to me, Ironheart is annoying, the subplot with Martin Freeman feels pointless, the needle drops are jarring and the attempts at humor fall flat.Despite all that, this is far from a bad movie and I could see myself watching it again. Not one of Marvel's best but certainly a bright spot in phase 4. Worth a watch."

",shadow_knight0,/user/ur7091710/,10 February 2023,"I'm not going to lie: the scenes involving Chadwick Boseman were somber and heartfelt and I really appreciated them. He was a wonderful actor and a great 'Black Panther'; I don't think anyone can replace him as the defacto idea of that character now. That being said: the film, due to his untimely death, had to be rewritten and had reshoots apparently left and right to complete. You can feel it in the writing and in the story of the film. Plot points that either don't make sense or don't go anywhere. There is an actual point in the film where characters argue about not having time to do something that could have stopped the entire final act of the film, but they spend more time arguing about NOT having time than just simply DOING the thing and moving on. It was utterly pointless and stupid. There's so much fluff in the film too. Little scenes and dialogue that isn't needed and so many scenes of a character simply so they can introduce her on her own show (and she's not even that likeable of a character; they could have done better on all fronts there). All in all: it wasn't better than the first (I knew that going in) but it wasn't even just a good stand-alone film with a new ""star"" to focus on. It was just...disappointing."
3," Overrated and rather boring
",Anviaxibus,/user/ur82391252/,10 February 2023,"Many have written how important, socially & culturally, this movie is. Oh, pls...there is absolutely nothing new about this movie. Over-hyped and over-praised. I'd say on the contrary. It shows how outside of this ""Golden city"", people are living in a third world state...the one's in power, living in all luxury. The battles are tribes fighting with high technological spears or the king's strenght due to giving him a flower potion and praying to the gods. Really !They became so advanced because 1000's of years ago, a vibranium meteor hit this place. Hm...and because of this precious metal, they were able to advance themslelves with superior technology !? One still needs the brains to do so imao. Only one man could do so in 'the West' and that was the father of Tony Stark. And his best invention, with vibranium, was a shield for Captain America. So I wonder, what they could do if they would find gold and diamants as well. They'd be able to create planets. At least give a better backstory. CGI wan't all that good and the storyline was...meh. Very stereotypical and very far from being thÃ© movie of the year 2018."

10," Bravo to Marvel re thinking the franchise.
",bgoo-19890,/user/ur82394134/,10 February 2023,I am a Gay man with no talent. Just opinions. In my opinion Marvel was kicked in the privates with the loss of Chaz Bosman. Instead of jettisoning the franchise . They re thought it and I think did it well. It is always hard to follow in the footsteps of a great actor. It is hard to jump into a franchise and reinvent it. Wakanda Forever restarts the franchise and sets up a bountiful future. Letitia Wright has stepped into big shoes. Her role in previous outings was small. More of a back story tto Panther in earlier outings. Ms. Wright has stepped up and shown us a Marvel Chaaracter theey can rebuild on. Great Job!
2," What a mess of a forced script
",federicoguillemi,/user/ur115427150/,10 February 2023,"Had no real expectations when seeing this movie, I even waited for it to be available for streaming. Everything in the movie is so forced, so wok, that is hard to feel any real empathy for the characters. There is no heroes trip, no arch, nothing to work for. Nothing is too compromised, no one is really bad or controversial. A real disappointment of a movie.Do not know where this would have led in the original plans if Chadwick would stills be the black panther, but the final result now falls short for a movie and looks much more as a manifesto.In all, a long, boring movie that sets no expectations on the saga or where marvel is moving."
9," This was everything...
",chasdescalzi,/user/ur154453388/,10 February 2023,"I had relatively high expectations for this movie, as I was wondering how they would deal with the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman. So I saw the movie, and boy, was I satisfied!The heart of this movie was outstanding (in my opinion,) and the story and narrative were all around great. Shuri was a fantastic character, and here arc was really heart wrenching, and Angela Basset is just mind-blowingly phenomenal in this. The whole movie was also VERY emotional in my opinion, so that's another great thing about this movie.I know some people out there don't like it, but I don't care. I still love this movie. 9/10."
2," Astonishingly tedious

Way, way, WAYYYY too long. I believe it clocks in at almost 2 hours and 50 minutes, which is over an hour too long. Whoever was editing this for release needs to be fired and then find work in some other field. Just because something was filmed doesn't necessarily mean it belongs on the screen.Secondly, it's very boring. BORING! The movie is basically just a CGI-fest where not much interesting or entertaining story really seems to happen from one minute to the next. Yeah, there's story, but not really that much of it and it just doesn't elicit any more contemplation on my part that a commercial for cat litter would. And it's so very predictable.Have I mentioned yet that I can barely even remember the plot of the movie because it was just such a tedious chore to get through? I watched this absolute snoozer followed by ""You People"" and really don't remember much from that entire evening as my brain was rejecting the low-quality fare and seems to have been on strike from forcing 2 really bad movies in a row on it.I'd rather have my almost 3 wasted hours back than retain any memories of this pointless movie. I feel 2 stars is generous."

I love a good 3hr movie.. as long as it's worth it's length of course.. I feel like there was just too much unnecessary and underwhelming filler throughout which made it drag out more than it needed to.. Decent performances aside, it just didn't do it for me.. And I couldn't help but wince at the nonsensical concept of, essentially, a water elf with tiny wings on his ankles that somehow allow him to maneuver effortlessly through the air.. Anyone with a basic knowledge of physics should find this absolutely ridiculous as an idea.. That was just too in the face for me to ignore.. Otherwise the movie was visually appealing..

So i figured i would finish it the day after, 10 days later i forced myself to watch the rest of it.I just dont like fairy super advanced fantasy countries that everyone just flies around and shooting. Its a mess, and ""regular"" soldiers with spears that act like they are on super steroids.It worked with a few in the avengers movies, the earlier panther movie was a stretch but a bit more doable.

There's a meme going round saying all new Marvel movies look like Spy Kids movies and this one really proves it. Just wow.

I really struggled to find any emotional connection with the main characters. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised because the original black panther movie was very similar, in that it was overly bloated with tribal dancing and posturing. It takes away the pace that was needed to keep my interest. Some of the backdrops and scenery were pretty but some of the CGI was absolutely dismal. You would think with the budget of these films that they would make the CGI a bit more convincing. I'm hoping marvel phase 5 takes us somewhere more interesting because phase 4 has been dull overall."
5," JUST ORDINARY !!!
",ajmeeracharan,/user/ur98070185/,9 February 2023,"Overall, the film was unremarkable and uncomplicated. The black panther's expectations were not met. Even the actors performance falls short of expectations, and I felt it was needless for them to create scenarios solely for our amusement. With unfortunately Chadwick Boseman gone, the movie really lost its center, and the way the plot develops feels like random items are thrown in for the aim of enthralling viewers-an endeavour that unquestionably fell short somewhat. Sometimes, the background music brings the movie to life since it is so distinctive and makes the moments tense. However, I do have a sincere query: What the hell are the avatar characters doing in the movie?ğŸ˜� Jokes aside, the movie wasn't terrible or wonderful; it was just average in my opinion."

The only good thing is the new creatures they added. These things are always creative and interesting. The movie is also way too long and has very boring parts. It should have been more edited and the lead should have been a more stronger growup woman and not a child looking for revenge and acting in a reckless manner. Even the mourning parts are not interesting at all and everything needs to be fine tuned. All in all, adequate movie but the typical story of bad sequals."
6," It's still Marvel..
",thePopcornExplorer,/user/ur36922988/,9 February 2023,"I felt the first installment of Black Panther didn't do justice to the potential the hero had, I felt it was overhyped and it came down to a very straight forward basic Marvel plot, however for some reason with the possibility of evolution and the occasional good film that Marvel puts out I was kind of hoping for an improvement the second time around, but its a bit of a drag.Let me start with the positives, the inclusion and depiction of different cultures, although a fictional depiction of both African and Mayan real life cultures its great to see it being depicted not as secondary aspect of a film but as the actual main narrative, I can't speak for accuracy in the production design elements from either side but nonetheless I felt that in a way both heritages were somehow celebrated if only for the ensemble of actors.And of course for the beautiful and respectful homage to the late Chadwick Boseman, it felt like a natural way as a send off to the character.Now for the slightly bigger list of down sides, the movie starts with great potential, a believable and intriguing antagonist (not villain, just the the other perspective) and I was actually invested, but then all the usual Marvel stuff gets in the way.The scientist.. I mean they did everything wrong with that aspect, without spoilers, that's the only person in the world capable of building the device really? That entire character construct is completely over the top and as the movie goes forward it seems for whatever reason the antagonist perspective which made sense up until half way through the film suddenly is ignored to become an excuse to have Black Panther vs ""main villain"" last showdown boring fight?Also, the speed in which the main character goes from understanding to a revenge machine is a complete weird change in character development its just too fast.. There are several plot developments that made no sense in the second and third acts of the movie and is filled with so much stereotypical hero movie stuff, the ""preparation to beat the villain"", the unsuspecting person without super powers that enters the fight without any previous experience yet manages to beat everyone, the ""spy/secret weapon"" that enters an ancient nation no one has ever been before without anyone blinking an eye... I can't give an higher rate no matter how good it is to see the inclusion aspect which I hope is a trend in Marvel going forward."

",jertth,/user/ur52232786/,9 February 2023,"It's not that its a bad story. The different elements work independently; but when you combine them into the climax, they *completely* dropped the ball on progressing from one story event to the next in a understandable manner.***SPOILER ALERT***They went from complete non-interventionism TO fighting a war with a nation that kidnapped their princess and wants to end all life on the surface of the planet TO that same princess promising they'd protect that violently radicalized would-be world conqueror if they just don't do it in the space of one movie.From a political stand-point, it makes no freaking sense.It's like placating Nazi Germany by ceding territory to it, except instead of ceding territory to them you take them under your wing and promise to argue to the world that they mean no harm.Does that make sense to you? Because it doesn't make sense to me.Longer layout:1. After the Namorians decimate Wakanda's expeditionary force and Namor announces peace under Wakanda's protection because Shuri beats him up and then spares him, everyone cheers and there are no repercussions.2. Wakanda commits to protecting Namorians from the surface world despite knowing with a deep and abiding certainty that Namor wants to kill everyone on the surface before they can become a threat.3. Namor gets upset at Wakanda for rescuing Shuri using violence and killing one of his people...despite knowing that by all appearances Shuri was kidnapped. The queen had no way of knowing that she had initially gone willingly; and even if she had requested to be taken to save the kid's life; she was still being held hostage with the kid. Dubious consent in the best of circumstances. And yet he immediately attacks because she was rescued from his captivity.Absolutely none of this is actually addressed. Their final confrontation is all about the death of her mother; and no direct mention is made of the harm he did to her, by taking her captive and then striking out at her people and family when she escaped.4. Revisit of #2. Namor has demonstrably proven that he is an unstable despot (god-king, anyone?) with ambitions of conquering the world. And Wakanda - the Marvel poster-child for non-interventionism - takes responsibility for that constantly-impending disaster?I don't think so.Again, for context - Namor's people are an underwater Nazi Germany with Wakanda-level nukes that want to proactively kill everyone on the surface who *might* be able to hurt them. Up to and including Wakanda itself."
2," Boring, lousy n a dragged on messy sequel with no heart !!
",rainishid,/user/ur157217092/,9 February 2023,"One of the most lazily written n boring of the mcu sequel till date. They tried to make the characters seem more intelligent than they're which made them seem more stupid haha. The ending fight seemed like more of show than and acutal fight with very bad CGI n wire work. The acting seemed inconsistent n hollow, only a few did justice. The only thing done right was the opening scene, rest was horrible. The male characters were shown to be dumb with almost no brain all. The whole movie felt like a missed opportunity n waste of what could ve been an awesome sequal only if it was written with more heart instead of focusing on political agendas of feminism n racial representation. This movie was pain to watch considering how awesome the 1st black panther was, cuz the 1st movie focused on telling a good story n world building. Iron hearts role in the movie felt insignificant. Though they tried replicating by paying homage to rdjs iron man with the hammer scene but it felt really hollow n forced instead of natural n investing. All in all it was a waste of almost 3hrs of my time. What I thought wud be an awesome sequel when looking at the trailers turned out to be a boring n hollow experience.This movie was about women arguing over things most of the time trying to sound intelligent with sloppily done cgi with kid fight action scenes.

If you watch this as a trashy comedy than it's fine, but it seems it meant to be serious. The whole idea, the acting and the plot are so bad, that I spend my free time to warn you and to lower you expectation.One can really hope, that the producers spend money on something meaningful in the future."
2," Just stop making these movies
",ss-kiekies,/user/ur40530529/,8 February 2023,"Where to begin!?The accent is so irritating.Story is so absurd with the feathery winged blue things with bone dry feathers on their heads and flipper things on their feet, riding whales upriver (the scale feels wrong too) - they remind me of the monkeys on the back covers from 80's comics.Where in the world does the dead depart in coffins that are sucked up and taken somewhere? Her ""tusk"" earrings are not warthog shaped, they are not antelope shape, they are not hippo or crocodile shaped... What are they? Alien or fake?As an African (from and in Africa) this film feels so fake and so far removed from what we experience every day with traditions and rituals. The funeral had in some parts elements from seemingly all over the place. The drumming is ok, the Xhosa is OK. It feels like a mockery of our African traditions.The jokes are seriously not amusing and it feels forced.I cant say that i finished watching - the more I watched the angrier I became at how stupid it all seems. Its just so over the top it became laughable."
3," Very boring
",hectorjs-641-605582,/user/ur42057364/,8 February 2023,"This movie just didn't do it for me. Story is bland, convoluted, shallow and unteresting. Acting is mediocre at best. Script and dialogues... So bad and predictable. Action is unimpressive, CGI ok but not really amazing either...
But the worst part, it just seems so pointless, all of it, fails to engage the viewer, very often through the movie i was checking my watch and wondering why am I watching this.And to top it all, Namor. What a humongous flunk. The whole character seems like a funnyless charicature. Namor, who could easily have been turned into a major character in future stories, what a waste.I give 3 stars instead of 1 only because of a few scenes here and there which seemed a little less unfortunate.To me, this movie is down there, among the worst in the mcu films, together with thor 4..."
10," I think this is amazing for what it turned out as
",EntertainmentDN-TVChannel,/user/ur159067770/,8 February 2023,I think it was all brilliant I didn't find any mistakes the action was amazing and also it was all good. I think also it should be more males doing Black Panther nothing against females but it doesn't keep to the original story of males so far every single episode is a female base film of the marvel industry it's like every film like thor hulk Superman all these characters I've got females in which is starting to take over the male side of it please do not go offended but I've noticed as a love that's going on but all otherwise the films are pretty cool amazing done right and done well. I think it should be more films coming out in the marble industry.
5," Sorry it just didn't work
",marianos,/user/ur4313254/,8 February 2023,"After Chadwick Boseman death, Marvel took the worst decision they could. They replaced Black Panther with its funny side-kick instead of recasting the role. The actress who plays Shuri, was very good in her Shuri role, but terrible in Black Panther role. She can't persuade anyone that she has the leader material needed for the role, and physically her figure inside the Black Panther costume was totally ridiculous. Her ""chopstick"" skinny arms and legs looked so ""out-of-concept"" during the battle sequences. I don't blame the actress, she was called to fill way bigger shoes that she can and it flopped.Also the final act of the movie where the big battle was taking place felt so biased and uninteresting. Not to mention the big script holes -- for example I don't get it at all why Namor left wakanda while he was winning .. just to give time to his opponents to come up with a better plan to defeat him !!!Marvel backfired with the choice of naming Shuri the next Black Panther, sorry it just doesn't work."
5," Mediocrity at its best!
",gaurav219,/user/ur8028645/,8 February 2023,A real mediocre sequal to such a good launch film (Wakanda 2018) & Marvel character of Black Panther. Weak scripting seen where neither death of Black Panther (T'Challa) was properly addressed while also it was needlessly long where entire story could have been easily narated in 110 min rather than runtime of 161 min. How did BP contract the illness isn't explained. A boring introduction of Namor (superhero cum villain). Shuri's character played by talented Letilia Wright seemed confused. The potential brightspot of Nakia though deserved more screentime. All in all poor treatment of characters killed a potentially good sequal. Same was with Thor Love & Thunder. Marvel writers seem to be going through a burnout something similar to what Star Trek writers & producers faced post DS9 (1999). Hope upcoming GOTG3 will be good Marvel quality.
5," Great Actors bringing a mess of a film up to par
",gsmit-72396,/user/ur83396355/,8 February 2023,"I never felt that I was made to engage enough to be that interested by the story to see how it panned out.Just enjoyed the excellent acting abilities of those involved!! With a chance to mourn the loss of what seemed a very good, genuine man and actor.Came across very muddled together to bridge a gap in future stories that are already partially written.Was hoping for a bit more thought out passing of the mantle.It l felt (to me) very committee driven, with a 'wanting to please them' writers room rushing and scrabbling with in your face statements. Without someone to steer a thoughtful but action (captain vs iron man) movie.And not particularly rescued by any engaging action scenes. Lots of 'stuff' without thrill, excitement or just ""that's kinda cool"" moments.In the end wasn't completely disappointed because (as I said above) saved by the fabulous actors bringing more than the movie had to offer without!!And found the most enjoyable parts we're watching them in isolation portraying emotion. And was where the real connection to Chadwick could be found!"
3," Better than most recent marvel but that's not saying a lof
",onetruesancho,/user/ur61749292/,8 February 2023,Honestly it was better than most recent marvel movies but that's not saying a lot. The movie traded in the iconic comic book characters any fan of marvel would actually want to see for a cast of b and c list characters that made the movie kind of uninspired and not really worth a watch. While there were some descent action scenes it just felt flat. A group of boss girls fighting off an army of villains isn't very convincing. The only thing that kept me watching was Namor which has been one of marvels more interesting villains in a while but I had a hard time caring for any of the protagonists.
1," Boring
",gymstarjb,/user/ur128419047/,8 February 2023,"Had to watch in 2 parts. Watched an hour, very boring, turned it off and watched the rest a days later. Very basic and weak storyline - could have told the main story in about half an hour, but they've padded it out it make a feature length film. Weak and unlikeable characters. Some of the cgi and fight scenes are laughable. I can't even recommend it to people purely based on the fact that its a Marvel film. Just nothing to like about this film at all. I've liked all of the Marvel films, some more than others but just don't get where Black Panther fits in the mcu. Very much a cash in of the Marvel name and the fact that its Wakanda so will appeal."
1," Well Worth The Wait
",jiml-90994,/user/ur153559943/,7 February 2023,"The MCU is now officially another Lifetime For Women network and just as boring. I intentionally resisted seeing this movie in the theatre. Having been less than moved by the trailers my concern was being stuck in a theatre for 2 hours and 41 minutes of boredom. My concerns were realized once I watched it streaming it at home. The movie is boring.I approached the movie hoping to, at the very least, be entertained. Throughout I made no connection with either character and thus had no concern with their plight in the movie. Angela Bassett was her usual brilliant self giving a couple of very intense and powerful lines in the movie. I was honestly glad her character was killed off as I do feel that this job is well beneath her talents. To do a cameo in The Black Panther is one thing but as a returning role I wouldn't recommend it to her. I can't help but wonder if she realized that herself and asked to be written out.I found Namor to be lacking in depth and at no point did he make me feel that I was watching the powerful character from the books. For one seeing him in the Mayan head dress was very odd knowing the character from the books. Also his entire plot line made no sense. A character who can fly like Superman and can go toe to toe with the Hulk can simply fly and go get the girl himself if he wanted her that badly. For him to go to Wakanda and threaten war if they don't bring him the girl when he could do it himself and or just wage war with the surface world to solve his problem was a very huge plot hole.I actually found most of the actions scenes to be laughable. When it's the Wakandans in a charge it's women at the lead in a fiery fury and when they are losing it's all men getting stabbed up. That's funny. None of the action sequences had any degree of intensity and just didn't leap off the screen. I kept waiting to be enamored by the new Iron Man woman but each time the scene cut to her she just seemed to be there making wise cracks and again not being very impactful.What is evident is that none of these characters carry any weight. I never connected with them in any way or with any action they took on screen. Shiri as The Black Panther was so rail-thin that no matter how she beat up the villain it wasn't believable and again carried no weight. She just didn't exude power no matter how many purple plants she mixes in to her elixir.This movie may be something you can go to if you just have 2 hours and 41 minutes to burn. If you don't go into it having any high expectations it won't disappoint."
6," Eh
",jimmyserhan,/user/ur162097918/,7 February 2023,"Good end to phase 4. I appreciated the way the film dealer with Chadwick's death yet I don't care for the synthetic heart shaped herb storyline.I loved everything about Namor's character and backstory and his manner of leading his nation.I feel like the death of queen Ramonda was unnecessary as it leaves Shuri alone and I feel like her drive should have been more political instead of a vendetta against the murder of her mother. I also saw it from a mile off as before her death Shuri had no drive to become black panther, which was stupidly spoiled by the trailer.Talking about Shuri becoming black panther, the ancestral plane scene was perfect in my opinion and I feel as if it worked better than what a scene with Chadwick would have been, killmonger's reveal was the greatest moment in the film and the scene paints the picture for what Shuri's black panther would be."
6," It suffered from an undeveloped script
",kosterthijs14,/user/ur49348950/,7 February 2023,"It felt like a waste of potential. I love Marvel and I really like Black Panther, but this movie (like most Marvel projects since Endgame) could have been so much better. Honestly, it should have been.The characters could have been great, all of them suffered from an incredibly underdeveloped script.How could anyone let this movie be this long? It could have been way shorter and more powerful because of it.The first film was fine, but this one just lacked. The actors seem to have done a great job with what they were given. Shuri and Namor stood out as characters because of two wonderful actors giving their all. Personally, I wasn't as impressed with Angela Bassett's role in Wakanda Forever as some people (the Academy) seem to be."
3," Wakanda Forgettable
",aaronuart-837-257842,/user/ur23835713/,7 February 2023,"First off, here are a few stars for those who worked hard on this movie. Sadly their work will fade very fast. One can see that they tried to create something compelling but after an interesting exchange between the protagonist and antagonist it loses the plot.Glad I waited for this to be on streaming because it's a great movie to have on in the background while you scroll TikTok. I think that's the audience it was made for because you don't need to pay it much attention to understand what's going on, however it isn't engaging enough a story to need to look at it.Marvel movies have become the McDonalds of the cinema, familiar taste, nice visuals, good branding and marketing but sadly cardboard and ultimately not good for you."
3," So painfully long...
",oceanofblue,/user/ur28892242/,7 February 2023,"Where to begin with this one?First of all, let me say I really liked the first movies the MCU brought forth.And so did I enjoy the first Black Panther.Then they saw what a moneymaking machine the MCU was and started to make one movie after another; some great, some walking a thin line and others were just better off being forgotten.And so qualifies the second Black Panther.Basically I can say I have already forgotten about most of this almost 3 hours of boredom.A movie so boring I just couldn't watch it in one go. I literally paused this movie 4 times, one part a day. I was dragging myself along, trying to give it a chance and thought I would get better. After the fourth time pausing it and seeing I still had an hour to watch I broke and just said "" Let it go"".And it was such a shame because it had a marvelous (no pun intended) opening and a beautiful hommage to Chadwick Boseman. The first dynamics were there and Danai Gurira as Okoye did a really good job.But as the movie progressed it had some great go's, as in ""we're getting some action"" only to fall back into a lengthy boring piece.Maybe I find the courage one day of finishing it, but so far... a hard pass.There are far better ways of spending 3 hours of your life. Like getting stuck on It's a small world with the music on repeat."
8," Best movie of phase 4!!!
",agnethagillbanks20,/user/ur23138030/,7 February 2023,"I just do not get the bad reviews. What is going on? This movie is by far the best of all the movies released in phase 4. All the rest sucked. This had a good story line, good action and amazing acting. And best of all they gave tribute to Chadwick Boseman. There were a few things things which were silly and could have been left out but all in all I think this was really good. I felt like phase 4 was a total wash out except for this movie and Wandavision series. I'm hoping going forward the MCU will step up its game and being back movies like the old ones. However this was a good start and I hope Quantmania will live up to it's expectations."
6," Spoiler alert! Not upto the expectations
",tssuhas-96708,/user/ur117568271/,7 February 2023,"They really destroyed all my initial hype about Namor, I mean they did not show his true potential at all even during the battle of wakanda and also didn't at battle of Atlantic ocean. And they even ruined all the background music that were there in black panther 1. The only positive here is they truly have given tribute to Boseman. Except Namor's intro there is no OMG moments by the end of the movie you will just see Namor's character as just a flying man with Spanish accent. They really did dirty with Namor which is in my opinion is unforgivable, even tchala's son's intro at post credit is okayish."
2," What a mess...
",wip-04940,/user/ur162086039/,7 February 2023,"This was so boring, the character development was pathetic. The movie structure was wrong. Without exaggerating, it has taken me 4 days to watch this movie, I kept falling asleep. This dialog was poor. The movie trickled forward so slowly and don't get me started at the acting, zero (0) skills. I have seen better acting for the local kinder garden production of little red riding hood.The only positive to this movie was the ending, when I say the ending I mean the credits, it was more fun watching those go passed then the actual movie.I live, born and raised in Africa and the thick fake accents was a disgrace and for some reason this movie if very one sided, wink wink. Stupid, silly movie."
7," A dump-all-in film
",siderite,/user/ur3146136/,7 February 2023,"Black Panther was a great success for Marvel and Chadwick Boseman had a great future as an MCU hero, but then he died. In order to somehow fix this broken continuity, Wakanda Forever was born, but it feels like a movie made by committee (which it probably was). It has good acting, but choppy plot. It has things appearing out of nowhere when the story needs them and characters that behave inconsistently throughout the film. It has problems in editing! At one point the music just glitches because they removed a scene late in postproduction, probably. It has women of color running everything: Black female Panther, Black female Ironman, Black female Black Widow, Black female Queen. It's not that it hurts the story in anyway, but it gives the impression that they dumped everything they had in this film just to make it not suck. I mean, they added Mexicans, too. They were trying to take the Wakandan jobs. Ok, bad joke, but the whole concept felt more racist than whatever I can say.It's not a totally bad movie, taken as a standalone, but in the context of so much source material and so many previous good MCU films, it does suck. The best part was Lupita Nyong'o. Her character weas interesting and she is so beautiful!In the end they drop a post-credits scene that ensures the possibility of a replacement for Chadwick, but I don't see how, unless they add some ""go to ancestral land and return 20 years older"" plot.Bottom line: compared to the first Black Panther movie, this film was accompanied by overwhelming silence. It's easy to find things to make fun of in it, but the fact that not many people even bothered says a lot. This is a run of the mill, committee approved flatliner."

7," Heartfelt.
",W011y4m5,/user/ur71088443/,7 February 2023,"I feel like before even starting a review, it's only fair to acknowledge the hugely influential circumstances of this film's creation because director & writer Ryan Coogler obviously had an entirely different narrative planned for the hotly anticipated sequel to 2018's box-office mega-hit ""Black Panther"" & upon the completely unexpected news of star Chadwick Boseman's tragic death, those initial ideas had to be scrapped / reconfigured at short notice in order to accomodate for the fact that the iconic, solo franchise had essentially lost its irreplaceable lead, without warning.Therefore, when viewing ""Wakanda Forever"" with context, it's no surprise to see it's turned out the way that it has; a frantic & conflicted (yet well-intentioned) blockbuster, constructed from the amalgamation of interesting concepts haphazardly strewn together under crushing pressure (& global media scrutiny / speculation) & in the traumatising wake of someone's passing, standing as a sincerely mature & mournful feature which seems at its strongest when attempting to act as monument to the actor's historic legacy whilst reluctantly continuing the story in his untimely absence.What I mean by that is there's a clear crisis of identity throughout as the plot understandably grapples with its own sense of purpose, wondering what it is & what it's actually meant to do without the main protagonist at the helm; emotions are raw & felt tangibly from beginning to end (& I really appreciated the quieter, contemplative explorations of grief it was brave enough to share with audiences), but I don't get the impression anyone behind the scenes had truly come to terms with what had happened by the conclusion of the production (again, only natural - as it's recent) since the clarity of mind this desperately needed is still lacking by the denouement & we arguably remain devoid of the honest answers to questions it raises.On the one hand, it sought to be nothing more than what's expected of it; a stereotypical installment in a globally recognised Disney franchise that ticked all the usual boxes & operated within the usual conventions of a super-hero genre flick (generically introducing new characters we'd recognise from the comics, expanding upon the world-building & setting up the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to continue making profits)... But on the other, there's a far more authentic, palpable melancholy present from the start that contradicts the lighter joviality we're accustomed to (interspersed throughout) & consequently, that makes the humour seem forced & dishonest - considering the expressions of happiness portrayed aren't as sincere as we're led to believe. Due to this, I can only describe the viewing experience as akin to watching a sanitised depiction of a filmmaker's sorrow; there's a multitude of depth (ironically) brimming beneath the surface (you could even say ""an ocean's worth""), yet little of it is permitted to actually be shown without restraint - in case the intensity of it deters prospective audiences from attending screenings in theatres & alienates cinema-goers.Therein lies the problem; the need to remain marketable (staying consistent with the brand) & the desire to be something else entirely; two immense forces which pull at each other from within & leave this somewhat inconsistent in tone.Then we have the technical aspect & although strong by the normal standards of a corporate project in this saga, when the basic premise involves blue skinned inhabitants of an underwater world warring against the encroaching technological advancements made by man, recklessly pursuing his own militaristic ambitions, parallels will obviously be drawn with James Cameron's ""Avatar"" & when such blatant comparisons are directly made (both thematically & visually)... This does undoubtedly pale, in respect to that.All in all, I don't dislike this follow-up but I'm dissatisfied with it (as it's perhaps dissatisfied with itself) because similarly to the ensemble (who do a commendable amount of soul searching in front of the camera), I'm also unsure as to their motivations & the reasons for the continued existence. Maybe when they figure it out, things will improve... And like any healing process, that comes with time this didn't possess when it was made."

This could have been dope , they should of had Michael B Jordan return or something to be the antihero to save them. Even when she turned into the black panther she didn't even really do anything badass. They also should of had at least a couple marvel characters as well involved. This Wakanda was nothing like the marvel movies prior. I feel bad saying this bc I like the actor of the sister but I really hope this is the last one.

When Chadwick Bozeman appeared, I felt that there was something special for the moments after wasting time for more than an hour and a half in farce.And I expected him to have a son, which is a very ""old"" idea from the writer to continue making new parts.I was hoping not to see any other parts of the original Black Panther movie, and my hopes were confirmed that any new work would ruin all the value."

The story is sort of ""if narcissist was a movie it'd look like this"" and it kind of echoes the liberal mindset given here you have 2 groups of people, and the group who murders the others people first, who sends spies into the other persons home first, and who iniates the violence gets portrayed as the victim and the group who simply defends themselves and retaliates after they get invaded is the aggressor.How anyone could see it otherwise is ridiculous but that's the world we live in, a world where the most violent proclaim themselves to be victims, while those who receive the most abuse get portrayed as aggressors, and it's crazy narcissistic."

But I'd rather live in a world where these things are viewed positively and in good faith, rather than cliche or whatever.It leans a lot into the fact of Chadwick Boseman's passing and does so in the best and most respectable way possible.

",Braga_HK,/user/ur44921297/,6 February 2023,"The film has a good tribute to T'Challa and has excellent performances, particularly from Angela Bassett. The addition of Namor as a new character is well received. The action sequences are entertaining and the wardrobe is well designed. However, the story feels light and the motivations of the villain, Namor, are not well developed. The pacing is inconsistent and the effects are good but with some issues in the composition of the cities. The final battle scenario also seems weak. The death of T'Challa/Boseman is handled well, but the movie is too reliant on it. Shuri doesn't work well as the protagonist and the changes to her character are not good. Okoye is the only character that feels connected to, but she is sidelined in the movie. M'Baku and W'Kabi are also wasted. The action scenes are mixed with some being awesome while others drag. Namor as a villain is good, but his motivations are ridiculous."

It should have been no longer than 100 minutes or so and dragged at several points during the first 2/3 of the movie. The last hour was truly outstanding and almost made the first hour and forty minutes worth wading through.Angela Bassett was at her best, as usual. The raw and believable emotion that she brings to the table is legendary. Letitia Wright lives up to her reputation as a rising talent in the lead role.

I'm actually having difficulty remembering the opening it was so boring...Oh yeah! T'Challa's death.#1. How would (even an ""organic printer"") be able to print something and it come to life?!?!? If that were possible...why not just print out a new T'Challa with the disease extracted? They essentially are saying they are able to create life from a printer.It was at this moment I knew this was going to be a terrible movie...I just didn't know to what extent.#2. I now understand the big complaint of the lighting of the film. And well, the overall editing of this travesty. The quick cuts from on aspect to another as well as hard cuts from scene to scene was causing a nauseating effect.#3. This movie is insulting to Meso-American people. And why were there blue and brown people? I understand Namor is a mutant (first time that word is used in Marvel Universe - I guess as a segue to bringing in the X-Men and Wolverine into the fold). But why did they make the villain, who is Meso-American take on a clearly Indian/Pakistani broken accent???#4. Not to mention a direct blasphemous take on ""Christ is Risen"" when his people slaughter the Colonials. Surprised Mexican Catholics didn't get up and walk out of the movie spitting at the screen and clutching Rosary Beads (Don't worry, I'm Hispanic).#5. So much recycling of things from so many other Marvel movies...most blatant that the FBI yells it when they storm the warehouse, ""She's got an Iron Man suit!"" And someone in design had to have been a Robotech fan because that suit looked so much like the Invid troopers.#6. Why would Shuri even be feeling any of the attacks Namor was inflicting if the Black Panther suit is designed to absorb all kinetic energy applied to it and store it as potential energy? And isn't the suit built with vibranium...it should be impenetrable.#7. What writer thought they knew what they were thinking when they used the word ""Pervaporation"" That is not the device or process the device performed. All they built we a ship-sized dehydrator...or an EVAPORATION device. I was embarrassed for all of Marvel that that actually passed the proofreading process.#8. How did they ""bug"" the Wakandan beads? A AI driven device would have the wither all to constantly scan itself for ""bugs"", let alone the technology is supposedly far more advanced that the govt wouldn't even be able to ""bug"" the device.#9. Who the hell builds a WAR SHIP with only ONE sonic device to do battle against underwater foes? And how did the device not kill that warrior from prolonged exposure when a sonic gun easily killed two Talokans that had less intensity.#10. Wouldn't the ""water bombs"" have killed the whales and riders since they went off while they were in such close proximity when they detonated.#11. How in the world was Okoye able to look out her new suit when the ""eyes"" no where close to matched up to her eye placement?!?!?! And why did it need the ""dreads""? Why give your enemy a means to capture and stunt your movement from behind?#12. Namor's breathing technique is NOT diffusion(that is the normal process for which oxygen and carbon dioxide is transferred either in a fish's gills or a humans lungs...Namor's process if more akin to breathing through an osmotic process since he does not have gills to breath underwater. These writers really did not do their homework...smh
#13. The whole premise that they would make the first Hispanic characters in Marvel completely war-driven is insulting. That they would also make Shuri act so infantile and spoiled, when all her other appearances she has been so jovial and technology based. Internal conflict could have been developed so much better.#14. Why did her hand weapons become inoperable? GRIOT was still operational after the crash...weapons infused with vibranium, should have been as equally durable. With that said, the spear never should have been able to penetrate the Black Panther suit.Overall...this seemed like such a hastily put together film in the wake of Chadwick's death, that they are lucky people went out of mourning for him. Because the movie does not pass muster by itself. I gave the movie two stars...one for Chadwick...and one because Martin Freeman saved the movie from being a movie that should have just been written off and destroyed so no-one would ever know how bad it was.I can't wait to see how HISHE handles this movie, lol!"
2," A Disgrace to the Memory of Chadwick Boseman
",kearl-50301,/user/ur84974089/,6 February 2023,"I finally saw BP:WF on Disney+ (the trailers just didn't get me excited to see it in theaters). And I am so glad I didn't waste my money on tickets. This movie was terrible. I rank it near the bottom of MCU movies (only above Eternals--the absolute worst MCU film). This movie suffered from so many issues:1. Lack of Black Panther: Granted, they lost Chadwick Boseman, but it shows they made the worst decision to not recast T'Challa or have the mantle taken up by M'Baku. To have Shuri take over as the Panther was a terrible choice. She does not have the presence to lead this franchise. And I didn't buy her abilities when she was Black Panther. They should have just left her in her lab. Heck, I would have taken a CGI T'Challa over Shuri.2. Editing: I rarely notice editing in a movie. However, it was so bad in this film that I couldn't help but notice how choppy and jarring it was--that's how bad it is. There were fight scenes where the motion of swing would get cut short to switch to another angle which would also get cut short. It completely took away from the energy of the action. And then, during the climax, it would jump back and forth between the two fights in such a jarring way as to completely undercut both fights. And, of course, there is no excuse for a movie like this to have a run time of 2:41:00. It is way too long. I was just so bored. I checked the time a few times, and I couldn't believe how much was still left. We watched it over two days, and it still felt like it dragged on forever.3. Lighting: It was just too dark. I could hardly see what was going on in the night scenes. And I heard this same complaint from people who saw it in theaters, so I know it wasn't just me watching it at home.4. Music: The song choices were terrible. And they just did not fit into the scenes they were placed over. It was like they just chose music they liked and plopped it in random scenes. Again, when music pulls you out of the movie, you know you've failed. The score itself was nothing to write home about. Very bland.5. Acting/Characters: Angela Bassett was fine. Everyone is talking her up for awards, but I don't feel it was at that level. To me, she can just get loud and angry. Letitia Wright went from playing an annoying little sister in the first one to just being uninteresting in this one. Dominique Thorne (Riri) was bland and annoying (her use in this movie was clearly to prop up her character for her upcoming Disney+ series). It only made me not want to watch it completely. But the worst performance, hands down, was Tenoch Huerta as Namor. His delivery was just abysmal. There were times I couldn't even understand him (thankfully, we had subtitles). He has now taken the top rank as the worst MCU villain of all time.6. CGI/Design: Not great. Some of the composite shots were just embarrassing. And the design of the tech suits was laughable. When your characters mention how bad things look, that doesn't endear the audience--it just points out how bad it really is, and how you felt it was too hard to make it look good, so you just make a joke about it. The MCU has done better.7. Plot: Totally illogical. This felt like a 1st draft. I know that they had to redo things when Chadwick passed. But this is what they came up with? There are just many problems with the story that it would take too long to list.I know there are many people who like this movie. Could for them. They talk about how emotional it was. I didn't get choked up once. It was just bland, boring, annoying, empty-calorie tribble. I doubt I will ever watch this movie again. What a disgrace to the memory of Chadwick Boseman. He never got a movie of his own that lived up to his level. If only they could have achieved what the Russo Brothers did for him in Civil War. Oh, how far we have fallen. Just another example of how Phase 4 is the worst MCU phase of all."
4," Wakanda Forever. (Well it sure seemed like Forever)
",jdowney-57-371157,/user/ur54043250/,6 February 2023,"This is the first Marvel Movie that was truly boring. Some of the Marvel movies, like Ant Man, Black Panther, and the last two Spiderman have been pretty badly written movies, but they all have a pace and great action that engages the audience. This movie, by the halfway point had a weak skirmish between over matched US Soldiers and Fish People, a weak skirmish between over matched French Soldiers and Spear People, and finally a really run of the mill by-the-numbers ""We have You surrounded!"" scene where three protagonists escape US Soldiers only to face the Fish People. There is one 5 out of 10 level action fight with spears that climaxes this scene. The rest of it...the car chases, the Junior Iron man suit, the drone crashing....all of this stuff was tired lame done better before action.For 90 minutes you watch Angela Bassett overact, Julia Dreyfus badly act, Martin Freeman do nothing. Florence Kasumba does as much as she can with her one dimensional character. Letitia Wright does a pretty good job though. Dominique Thorne I can not decide...did she suck or is the character so contrived, stupid and bad that there was nothing she could do. But it is mostly hokey and horrible. Tenoch Huerta (Prince Namor), good or bad? Competent enough, but the character simply is not Sub-Mariner.And I will say this. Michael B. Jordan's departed Kilmonger is brought back to do a scene in the movie. Watch that scene..it is an example of the worst acting I've ever seen in a movie. This guy literally read his lines about at the competence level of High School Drama production. He is stunningly horrible in this scene.Mainly this is just boring. An extended African send off for the late Chad Boseman, whose tragic death clearly crippled the Black Panther franchise, followed by UN Wakandaphobia, and then Sub Mariner taking Surhi down to Atlantis (10 mintues of floating through underwater Disneyland to bad music)...which isn't Atlantis now because of the horrible mistake of re-imagining one of the oldest best Marvel characters to fit Ryan Cooglers vision of non-white supremacy and conceding 'Atlantis' to DC's Aquaman. A lot of pointless chatter, scenes of people preparing for watever. A bunch of people do bad African accents. None of the dialogue is important and much of it is cliches. Part of the problem is Shuri's character doesn't have another character to bounce her conflicts off of. It probalby should have been Ironheart, but it could have been Namor. It's a miss because the true story is her emergence as the Black Panther and we just watch it...we don't really empathize with her.The second half of the movie comes down to an attempt to recreate the Avengers Age of Ultrom climax fight scene, right down to a bunch of slo-mo co-ordinated fight choreography with all the players 'working together'. I can give credit where it is due, it finally delivers the missing action that we expect from a Marvel epic. But at no point is this battle as good as the epic fights we have seen from the Wakandans in the Avenger Movies and Black Panther 1.I also believe this movie is a bellwether. It is the first time Marvel Studios has made a mistake that Sony and Warners keep making with their Marvel and DC stories. You took one of the best Silver Age characters...Sub Mariner and you rewrote the back story to fit your director's needs. Bad Move. Namor is 'Roman' backward. He wasn't a 'meso American'. The exact thing that made Iron Man and Captain America (and teh first X-Men) work so well was the idea that all you needed to do was follow the Silver Age story. Sony wasted Dr. Doom and Silver Surfer by changing them. DC has done the same with Flash, Atom, Hawkman.I expect this is the start of the decline of Marvel. Silver Age was 1 Million Unit / Month comic books. Those charactes are iconic. Black Panther was one of them. But when you start moving into the 1970s and post that...those comic book characters never had popularity. Nobody cares about 'The Marvels', nobody is going to run out to see Iron Heart with Dom Thorne; and Shuri as Black Panther, or Anthony Mackie as a new Captain America will not have the automatic audience that the original Silver Age characters had. And as we see more efforts by more diverse directors...we are going to get less popular characters being made into movies by people who are just doing a job...they are not particularly enamored of the Comic book genre. (To his credit, Jordan Peele turned down directing one of these movies for that reason, 'Comics are not really my thing')"
1," A film is supposed to be watched not just heard
",jmdidk,/user/ur118105607/,6 February 2023,"They should have just released this as an Audio Book! While the story seems interesting, and acting is great -from what little I can see and mostly hear, but Cinematography is absolutely abysmal. Back when there was a debate on whether Oscar's should cut down on the number of Awards presented during the aired ceremony, award for cinematography was one of many they considered dropping and I remember reading someone's take on that and as matter of factly stating, ""there is no film without cinematography."" And that is 100% correct. Current generation of filmmakers have forgotten about suspension of disbelief, they want everything on screen to be described or explained as If its real. Cinematic Realism is a concept which allows us audience to remove any need to ask for explanations on things which in realism might not make sense. What i'm trying to say is, THIS FILM IS TERRIBLY LIT! I'm not watching a documentary. Im watching a Marvel Pop corn Movie. Light the damn characters! You dont need to explain where the source of light is coming from. JUST LIGHT THEM! If I wanted to listen to an Audio Book I wouldn't have come to Cinema for it! Like seriously. Stop this BS with everything being so god damn dark! Its so annoying!"
3," Wasting your precious time
",mohammadbakhtiarg,/user/ur105074617/,6 February 2023,"I still can't believe that I could stand watching the movie to the end and weirder than that is with this kind of budget they can make horrible awful (whatever you like to call it) movie like this I couldn't connect in any kind with any characters of the movie, most of actors did their worst,storyline was completely predictable it looks they have forgotten Thanos and those people who died, I mean it happened to all the universe!! It's too stupid to think you have something and it brings you power but your enemy with same thing can't reach that power or technology in other words storyline has lots of problems it's made for 5 to 10 year old kids I think it wasn't good even for them."
6," Poor Storytelling of Great Material
",Mabkid,/user/ur2963685/,6 February 2023,"I really wanted this tribute to Chadwick Boseman, the Submariner, and female empowerment to be good. But it was mediocre at best.After the passing of the Black Panther, and the exposure of Wakanda and their Vibranium, the world covets it. The Submariner's world was accidentally discovered, and a series of misunderstandings turn the two countries with Vibranium into adversaries.The material sounds great with promise. Unfortunately, the delivery fell short. Things moved too fast with minimal dialogue and plot depth. The underwater CG was also not so great. It was hard to become invested in all that happened. The result is a lot of senseless deaths for naught.And at the end, as if a tribute to Chadwick Boseman could cover up all the shortcomings. That felt cheap.It's not a total disaster. It's an ok fantasy action flick, but completely forgettable. I just didn't want the tribute to Chadwick Boseman to be that forgettable."
9," Surpasses the Original in Every Way
",alex-970-552873,/user/ur51962505/,6 February 2023,"This current phase of the MCU has felt very throwaway, especially when it has come to the movies. Doctor Strange was a missed opportunity, Shang Chi lacked stakes, Eternals was a mess, and Thor was an unmitigated disaster.While I would love to have seen Chadwick Boseman don the Black Panther suit once more, sometimes a tragedy can lead to something beautiful. And that is certainly the case with Wakanda Forever.The loss of Boseman can be felt in every single scene but that only adds to the drama of a country adrift by the loss of its king, protector, and veil of secrecy.Now very much in the public eye, the nation must decide who it is and what kind of influence it will have on world events.In a lot of ways, this is another origin story, and although the Panther only appears very late in the film's epic runtime, it feels wholly earned and meaningful.There's plenty of action and spectacle for those who like a good blockbuster but the movie's real power of comes from its heart and the journey of the characters and the all important question of whether they can reclaim what has been lost before they lose themselves.I haven't enjoyed a Marvel movie this much since Infinity War and End Game.Wakanda Forever!"
1," Absolutely shameful sequel
",andersonjfl,/user/ur113727841/,6 February 2023,"Despite an extraordinary cast, enormous budget and the singular headwinds created by the tragic and heartrending loss of Chadwick Boseman, this is not just a bad movie, it is a shameful failure. The storyline is a mind-numbing, meandering work of crap. The new characters-in particular the melodramatically developed ""villian"" are not just laughable but insulting ridiculous. Hermes the merman who decides in order to attack the surface he will wage war on the Wakandans (and kill their Queen) in order to force them to be his allies is simply the stupidest plot line ever produced in a Marvel film (and that is setting the bar very low, e.g., the She-hulk attorney-at-law dumpster fire of a movie). The writers should resign in embarrassment and repay whatever they were paid. And nearly 3 hours of this dreck in which the new Black Panther does not appear until 2 HOURS(!) into this diarrhea of a film, is simply unconscionable. Shame on Disney for such a piss-poorly written, edited and directed film. And shame on them for so astoundingly failing to honor the extraordinary work of Chadwick Boseman by producing such a gross and tedious waste of time, money & talent. Better that they had simply ended the franchise than subject the millions of people worldwide who admired and grieve Mr. Boseman's loss to such shameful mediocrity."
7," Worthy Follow up to Black Panther
",grglmn,/user/ur47597631/,6 February 2023,"I know I am in the minority, but Black Panther just kind of left me cold. It seemed like it was more ""hey look, we fleshed out the fictional land of Wakanda from the Marvel comics and isn't it really cool?"". I know there was as storyline about t'challa and his rival, but I really wasn't feeling it.Wakanda Forever, more drama, more emotions, villains, easier to root for the ""home"" team as the whole world, ansa new, powerful villain and people fight against them.I do admit that the middle is probably longer than it needs to be, but it is a good set up for the rest of the movie. A good ride, after the latest Thor, Dr. Strange, and Black Widow movies I was about ready to give up on Marvel, but Wakanda Forever gives me hope that they can still create a Marvelverse and make a good flick."
3," Epic let down... Marvel FLOP
",eric21588,/user/ur30130354/,6 February 2023,"The first Black Panther movie was great.This was so disappointing.The story line was sporadic and was a poor attempt to cram a ton of material in one movie without making us care about the characters enough.Plot was flimsy.When the new Black Panther comes into play... all the sudden they not only invincible but an acrobatic war lord, even though they had no real prior history fighting.Absolutely amateur production.CGI was dry just downright poor.There was literally one single battle scene that was in wide screen and the rest of the movie was in full screen. So as they toggled back and forth between the two different battle scenes your picture on screen keeps changing from full screen to wide screen.They also if a terrible job with explaining king T'Challa's death."
3," -2 stars for just annoying me
",brucecsnow,/user/ur48914994/,6 February 2023,"First Letitia Wright isn't strong enough to be cast as a lead in a Marvel movie. She's ugly, weak and whiney. No charisma. Compare her performance to Angela Bassett.Second, what's the purpose of Julia Louis Dreyfus in this movie? Agent Ross? Just a waste of screen time and comedic talent.Third, the antihero is explained but not really his forces. How'd he get the Vibranium and why aren't they not superadvanced as Wakanda? If it was explained I missed it. Just one of numerous plot holes.Many other problems. Too long. Nobody seemingly gets killed. Almost A-Team like. And the ending, its like an apology that Wakanda needs a replacement hero. Michael B Jordan reprisal is just weak."

5," A movie made for REALLY dumb people
",willkthewpboy,/user/ur134180910/,6 February 2023,I'm not even going to bother talking about all the inconsistencies and plot holes in the writing because there's too many to bother with. The fact that the writing was bad enough to bother me while I was baked outta my mind means you'd have to legitimately pay me to watch this movie sober.The proper way to watch this movie is to shut your brain all the way off and just skip to the good looking visuals they burned so much money on. Do not watch the entire thing or you'll surely regret it.The one positive in this movie is that the villain is more fleshed out than other marvel villains; unfortunately the villain is still bad. I couldn't take the guy seriously everytime they showed the pants he was wearing. Showing the dead queen speaking in a vision to Shuri against a still green screen background was pretty funny too even though they wanted it to be serious.
1," Glad I waited for streaming
",dr-82130,/user/ur162033433/,5 February 2023,"I have really enjoyed Marvel in the past but this last round has been quite terrible and Wakanda is the worst of them up to this point. It's beginning to resemble WB DC movies. I'm starting to give up on them and at a minimum will skip the theater releases.I hope Disney can get this figured out. They had a great thing going at one point. People who enjoy Marvel movies may give them a pass for a little while but not for long.I am also a bit surprised of the ratings thus far. I have to believe people found this movie well below standards and are fooling themselves. It was a slow, disjointed, muddled mess. Many of the scenes were so dark you might as well have been watching a black screen. The war scenes were a joke and and poorly choreographed. I am still trying to find these large armies that were discussed in the movie went. I was actually laughing at one point.The intro that honored Chadwick Boseman was nice.Overall, I am thankful I watched this on streaming. I could pause the movie which was the only entertaining thing about it."
5," Not for me
",the_noizylobster,/user/ur98369134/,5 February 2023,"The tributes to Chadwick Boseman were poignant and heartfelt. The MCU suffered at his lost. This movie especially. It doesn't feel like they knew what to do with the story and characters after losing Chadwick.I'll start off by saying the acting for the most part was really good. The set design and costumes like always were excellent. I loved the Inclusion of Namor and the ""Atlantean"" people and I thought it was executed fairly well.But if they really wanted to create a good story about loss and closure they could have made a simpler, more palatable movie. This was just kind of a mess. The plot was far too convoluted and it was not gripping to keep me from feeling bored.The CGI battles sucked. They went to over-the-top and the choreography really was jumbled and messy and the CGI didn't help. I feel they should have gone with the Shang Chi approach and keep the action grounded for at the least for half of the movie. The CGI iron-woman suit sucked along with a lot of the physics and weight of most of the super-fights. Aquaman's underwater fights were far more entertaining than these.Ross's inclusion was ok but Julia Louis-Dreyfus's character SUCKED. The acting was cheesy and the character has nothing to do but have weird interactions with Ross. I guess he's going to be a fugitive now? I feel like they could have found a better way to get him to join the wakandan side of things. Also the incessant need to call him a ""colonizer"" is just distasteful.Riri also didn't really have much reason to be there other than be another sassy character who's ""smart"" because she's ""smart"". Her inclusion was unnecessary when the stories main focus should have been on Shuri, Nakia, M'Baku, and Okoye. 4 characters that are fairly well written and likable.In the end this movie was just too overly self righteous and didn't leave me feeling satisfied. It wasn't really that fun to watch. Marvel movies
should at least be fun right?"
5," Wakanda Forever is not a comic book movie
",joncranefilm,/user/ur139046026/,5 February 2023,"This movie is bound to be divisive, but if you think all the way back to iron man and the start of the MCU that was a comic book movie. You didn't need to remember the back stories of half a dozen characters. You could sit in the cinema with your 11 year old and they wouldn't be telling you they're bored after 30 minutes. Remember when iron man went super high and froze up? There's a bit of that in wakanda Forever. Remember when Dr Strange met a teenager with a fantastic gift and had to protect her? There's a bit of that in wakanda Forever. Remember when Eddie Murphy came to New York with his chaperone? There's a bit of that in wakanda Forever. I half expected Eddie to pop up in a barber shop in heavy prosthetics. I get the need to address the passing of Chadwick Boseman he was a fantastic actor and perfect as the black panther, but the bit about death being a gateway between revenge and forgiveness is well overdone. It didn't feel like a 2h43 movie but considering the source material this is more for middle aged men to pick over than any previous Marvel outing to date. That being said I'm sure Ant-man Quantamania will be choc full of fan service."

The characters are no longer interesting, neither are the villains. This movie felt about an hour too long, the action sequences were far too infrequent. The emotion was missing in the dialog and acting and all in all doesn't really fit in a series of movies, it's just a stand alone - thing. It's a movie you will watch once and likely never be interested in watching again, however the original marvel series of movies are still loved and watched over and over. If Disney don't plan on taking marvel movies and this second series of films for anything more than a money spinning exercise then we should all vote with our eyes and stop watching this tripe."

Ok so it seems like everybody wants Wakanda's vibranium, that's interesting. So Namor wants the help of Wakanda to find the scientist who created the machine that was able to detect vibranium? Like why not do it himself? Im sure he has people able do to it. They have special masks for when they are out of the water. Why involve Wakanda? Nonsense plot. So the person who made the vibranium detector is a student? Come on, that's so cringe and dumb. Also she is ''the only one who knows how to do it'', yeah sure, sounds right. And it was a ''school project'' LMAO! Now CIA doesn't have the way to make their own detector? And she also has an Ironman suit and she knows how to control it, fly etc?Things keep getting worse and more ridiculous. This is an insult to Ironman's legacy. Shuri, Okoye and Riri literally destroying cars of innocent officers, who knows how many died during these scenes. I wonder who is the good guy in this movie right now. Namor's people have an interesting design, not great but very decent. It's kind of weird that Namor talks in english but his people don't. So we see kid Namor killing... you know, the ''bad people''. Oh Marvel you and your repetitive messages. Also I don't like that they made big changes to the Namor lore. The underwater city is beautiful. So Namor wants the help of Wakanda to attack the surface world? All that because the surface world now has a way to find the vibranium? Thinking that the surface world at some point will attack his people?Also theatening Shuri that if she won't help, Wakanda will be the first nation he attacks? He sounds very very paranoid. Wow I didn't expect that the queen would die like that. I really enjoy the war between them though, because they are so different, they have different strengths and weaknesses, so it's definitely interesting. Shuri is under so much pressure, she has lost everything, it's tragic. The fight scene(s) towards the end were good. Finally an MCU movie that is not just one joke after the other. A more serious tone and more serious movie. The end with Shuri having flashbacks of her brother was very emotional. In this movie Shuri is a strong character and I think she proves that she can be a decent Black Panther. It's an ok movie but definitely not great. My rating is 7.0/10."

I used to love marvel movies but I think I've come to the point where I feel the story is too mainstream and they abuse and profit through culture and race rather than providing an art piece with good quality. You can clearly see a difference between original marvel movies and the movies they make now.

The horrible fight scenes (especially at the end) looks like a school project in choreography and cinematography.The editing and dialog is pretty weird as well throughout the film.There's a few new characters that are too, born geniuses and lack any new personality traits compare to what we have gotten the last... 10 years.Cliche.

The fight scenes were poorly choreographed and lacked the intensity that one would expect from an Black Panther.

8," I liked it...
",Thanos_Alfie,/user/ur33907744/,5 February 2023,"""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is an Action - Drama movie and the sequel of ""Black Panther"", in which we watch the people of Wakanda mourning the death of their King T'Challa while they have to fight in order to protect their home.Due to the fact that the Black Panther sequel had a different feeling even before its start, I was a bit confused or even pessimistic about it. That feeling lasted minutes after the beginning of the movie and changed into excitement. The direction that was made by Ryan Coogler was very difficult but also very good and I believe that he succeeded on connecting the previous events with this movie. The interpretations of Letitia Wright who played as Shuri, Lupita Nyong'o who played as Nakia and Danai Gurira who played as Okoye were absolutely magnificent. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Tenoch Huerta's who played as Namor and he was simply outstanding. Lastly, I have to say that ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it."
4," Boring, long, convoluted and altogether ridiculous
",Jan1968,/user/ur16268163/,5 February 2023,"Right after watching Black Adam (and making fun of it) we started this one, only to realise we watched them in the wrong order.I nearly fell asleep and looked at the timer several times, shocked by the amount of time still to endure.I'll not get into all the stupid stuff in this movie, except for one thing. Everyone flies nowadays, apparently. But Namor? Four dove-sized baby-wings, two on each feet? Really? And with those he jumps around in the sky like a lens flare?! The most incredible thing about that is not the baby-wings, but the fact that they not only made the script, but even the film! And there I was, thinking that Yoda jumping around like a frog on acid in ""Attack of the Clones"" was ridiculous.Another thing I have to get off my chest: as in most of the CGI-infested films these days, physics are completely off, which makes you feel like watching the cut scenes in a computer game. When you present a BIG thing, it should FEEL big, move slowly, fall graciously, in short: respect gravity. ATTENTION ALL FILM MAKERS: go see Avatar I & II and study it like it was your bible!! THAT'S how you do physics!!"
7," Not Quite What It Should Be
",Sassy2_9,/user/ur3632795/,5 February 2023,"The movie in and of itself is good, but slightly convoluted. There is A LOT going on and nearly an hour into it before things start making sense. The production & cinematography are lovely, but I feel like there is SO MUCH going on, we start losing emotional resonance. Still, worth a watch for sure, especially if you are a fan of the the 1st movie. Many of the same themes remain. Overall, quite lacking and it's riding on the previous film's coattails for sure. I'm not gonna lie... I got really bored through part of it and just wasn't sure what this movie is trying to say, and even why it was made. So a part of me feels like this is the Director getting to be a little more artistic and edging away from MCU, but at the same time, it also feels like a bit of a money grab because I don't know why the story needed to be told."
1," Bad and confusing movie.
",sebulbathx,/user/ur162016079/,5 February 2023,"I can't recommend anyone to waste 2-3h of their lives watching this movie. Especially if you want a Marvel superhero type of movie because it didn't feel like any previous Marvel movie at all.I thought at some point I was watching some historic movie about africa people just fighting against ""a threat"". No super villain or anything like that and after half of the movie I was even rooting for the villain. When the good guys killing innocent police who only do their job then it's hard to root for them. And Shuri who is the main character don't work as main character at all and gladly waste innocent soldiers for her own personal purpose without hesitation. In my view a great hero will sacrifice their own personal agenda for the greater good and Wakanda Forever's ""hero"" absolutely don't do that. Since when did the hero kill innocent people?Sure I guess collateral damage saving the world but this was borderline murder at some occasions.Also does it only live women in Wakanda nowadays?I mean where have all the men gone it felt like I saw like one man out of twenty women basically.I rarely write reviews but I had to with this movie because it was so bad and I don't want other people to waste their time! And have you seen The Woman King then you basically have seen Wakanda Forever, imo."
3," Don't watch this movie
",mikel-48173,/user/ur122777098/,5 February 2023,"I saw ""Wakanda"" on a Friday night. On Saturday I watched the Norwegian ""Troll"". To this day, I have no idea why Wakanda was nominated for a special effects award. I hope I don't see any more Riri Williams wearing worse armor than Iron Man in 2008. This movie shouldn't be made. And the great actor and man Chadwick Boseman should be honored in a different way. Not a movie where you can make a lot of money from the death of one man. The film was created solely for political reasons. Out of respect for Mr. Boseman, I give it a 3/10. Two points more than he should have. You should be ashamed, Kevin Feige."

",webperformance,/user/ur128029170/,5 February 2023,"Long and boring I fell asleep twice watching! Marvel overall has gone downhill since end game and this is just another below average movie! Pushing the sister into lead role was awful decision she's clearly not up to lead role! Supporting cast isn't strong enough to carry such a weak lead. Long long boring conversations plague this show with limited action sequences and a very weak plot! It's hard to find any positives here! When watching a movie I ask would I watch again? The answer is absolutely not just too long, too boring, weak lead, weak story just kill this movie! Really hard to get through I'm not sure where sone high ratings come from I can only assume it's from people employed by film as this was a real dud! Ok to watch if free but don't rent or buy imo."

2," Not good two way out too far fetched
",jrsfishing,/user/ur162015098/,5 February 2023,I think the people who created this movie dropped acid while they were sleeping and they dreamed this movie up it's just too bizarre pretty good fight scenes and animation but way too bizarre everything's bizarre today just too far fetched sorry but they need to go back to the drawing board and make it more realistic not so far out with underwater creatures human beings with no gills and wings attached to their ankles again they must have been on acid a lot of movies today are way out the only way I think you can imagine up a movie like this is to be on drugs when you take drugs you dream deeply you can actually make a movie out of it and what you dream while on drugs again especially acid.
3," Marvels most agenda pushing movie yet.
",eddiehagopian,/user/ur147720172/,5 February 2023,"I think this movie only shows 4 to 5 men throughout its duration of 2 hours and 42 minutes with 5 to 6 black excellence super genius powerful proud independent women. When did Disney and Marvel become so agenda pushing and political? I understand they had to work around with the script with the extremely unfortunate passing of the legend, Chadwick Boseman (R. I. P.), but this was not what I was expecting at all.As for Ironheart...(.........) I actually tried to force myself to be excited because of how much I loved Iron Man but this was almost disrespectful to the legacy of Tony Stark and the Iron Man Trilogy. We were there when Tony had to build his first suit to escape a cave and then saved the world multiple times and basically became majority of the worlds most favorite super hero who ended up being killed for dramatic effect. Then this random girl nobody knows all of the sudden casually builds her own iron man suit, stealing all of Tony Starks signature moves and then boom here comes 2 more Iron Man suits later in the movie for the other 2 characters like come on!! Marvel should've taken their own advice from Falcon and The Winter Soldier and should not of messed with legacy unless it was from someone who the fans believed completely earned it, like for Sam Wilson becoming Captain America. And the suit LOOKED ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!All that is just complete disappointment from one huge Marvel fan who has come to accept what Marvel is doing to the MCU.As for the movie alone without thought of anything else? Well, it was messy. Extremely messy with scenes that came out of nowhere that didn't really affect the plot one bit and felt repetitive from previous scenes. There were also over 5 pretty big plot points that just left you with so many questions that were never answered like what exactly killed T'Chala? How did IronHeart build the Stark suit? Why did Shuri see killmonger? And more of Marvels decreasing CGI effects.I truly don't know anymore. Yes, people can say I'm just a fan that never moved past endgame but these Marvel productions just keep tarnishing the golden, goated, cinematic universe that is the MCU. (R. I. P. Marvel)"
8," Emotional
",wifeymoof,/user/ur97745132/,5 February 2023,"Wakanda Forever is one heck of a traumatic, emotional roller coaster. Everyone speculated about how the franchise could continue without Chadwick. The tribute to his legacy was touching. Not afraid to admit I cried from the onset! He is truly missed!Onto the story. Angela Basset is absolutely the best thing about this movie! Strong,powerful woman. Her speeches gave goosebumps. The villain was OK, but he didn't give me ""chills"" or scary bad guy vibes. No real reason for the conflict. Shuris character arc is a bit shoddy. It could have been done better somehow. Ironhearts introduction was good at the start but then sidelined her into a back character. I dislike her suit design but that's personal preference. Plus, Shuri getting stabbed then miraculously healing in minutes, bit silly.Overall, a good film but I'm glad to see the end of phase 4 ðŸ™ˆ."
5," Muddled and lazy story line
",clabrough,/user/ur84566312/,5 February 2023,"It was a shame they did not revive the Black Panther (RIP MR Boseman ) earlier at least there would be someone to bring together all these disjointed story lines. It took to long to get there. And was as silly when it did as the rest of the story. Nice to see the sub mariner brought into the Marvel Universe. Also the young scientist just seemed a fleeting idea who could be the next Ironman
Your better off watch original or endgame.There is a undistructable suit designed by princess which was never used when they where first came under attack yet they use in finally? Some of the cgi is milky and lacks definition."
4," Boring CGI fest
",adamladany,/user/ur134320200/,5 February 2023,"The CGI was on point. Everything else: boring, dull, lame. The movie starts great, then it's all downhill from there. Everything that's in it we have all seen it before. There are no plot twists. The story is not following the original comic story origins. The whole thing feels like "" we had to make a sequel"". The motivation of all the characters is so one dimensional. The movie just wasn't entertaining on any level. There are no funny moments, you see the end a mile away. The editing and the visual effects were really on point. As far as making a movie: it's a really well made from a technical point, apart from that it's just lacking everything why you would want to watch or maybe rewatch a movie. I expect more from a marvel movie. Go read a comic instead or just sleep, that's time better spent."

6," Solid follow up to a bland first outing
",liam_nb,/user/ur83785458/,5 February 2023,"Chadwick Boseman was very good as black panther, id rather have seen him recasted rather than the quite unlikable shuri take up the mantle, but thats the way it goes, she is the first reason this movie loses stars she just such a none emotive and bland character who brings nothing to the movie.Now the good outweighs the bad you have the quite interesting Namor with a decent origin and good wings on his feet as well as his sometimes blue friends with cool outfits, the cgi on them is mid tier but they have moderately goods fight coreography so that makes up for it.We have talked about the villains and there decent motivation, now we go to the heroes who have questionable at best motivation for heroes they are very deadset on not being heroic hell in one scene okoye cheers as riri wastes several coppers and doesnt try to protest or help when more get murdered but theyre willing to let wakanda die for this random smart girl but hey everyone else is expendable.Okoye has decent character development and acting despite still retaining her awful accent and her violent tendancies, Nakia is completely the same character so meh, M Baku is the real hero here good acting good character devlopment the only good guy whos actually a good guy.Now we come to the lamest charact Riri Williams shes just got nothing to offer, when she gets to wakanda she doesnt do anything shes a plot device, young black girl for wakanda to protect from nasty Namor, shes just kinda following the main characters and you dont even see her make her armour, speaking of the armour it looks awful, terrible cgi looks like blurry power ranger armour or something out of a old video game i think thats my biggest gripe with this movie ironheart is pointless and looks terrible shes a plot device nothing more.Side note Martin Freeman gets less sctreen time which is a shame and he gets called coloniser twice which i dont think is very nice since hes the only american defending wakanda go call Elain from seinfeld a coloniser she has that mindset not poor Martin.6/10 mediocre cgi, decent soundtrack, 50/50 character development, good villains, heroes suck mainly, lots of stupid sciuence with no explantion and i think theyre gonna involve wakanda in the thunderbolts movie so thats fun."
2," Too long, too boring, lack of lead star
",confidential-67897,/user/ur85802235/,5 February 2023,"I'm hate to say it, but this movie is actually worse than Eternals.The main problems are; there is no decent lead actor. Lititia Wright may be ok in very short doses, but she just cannot carry off a movie let alone a huge movie like this as the main star. It's like watching a Bond film, without James Bond ever being on screen.The main Villain is also not very good, very one dimensional and just looks like an out of shape middle aged man in large green pants.The mobile is about an hour too long, and for most of it, it's very slow and boring.There is only a couple of marvel movies I would never bother watching a second time, and this is one of those movies.Finally watching an 80lb woman fighting like a superhero is just ridiculous."
3," Emotionless watch
",mickeythechamp,/user/ur52112075/,5 February 2023,"Road to the Oscars 2023. This movie is nominated for 5 awards, some more deserved than others in my opinion. The awards are; best supporting actress, visual effects, best original song, costume design and make-up and hairstyling.What a snore to get through. Wakanda Forever feels like one of the most forgettable movies IÂ´ve seen in a while with what feels like no heart or soul put into it. IÂ´ll give them one thing: itÂ´s hard moving on when tragedy strikes. I think none of us expected Chadwick Boseman to lose his life so soon, and it can sadly throw off a lot of industry work and planning. Of course, respect, human life and mourning comes first, and this movie handles that aspect with some respect but clearly then had to fill out the rest of itÂ´s runtime with mediocre things. Boseman will be missed. Also why is there two movies in the Oscars this year with blue people living underwater?In the wake of TÂ´Challas passing. Everyone is mourning and the new leader of Wakanda is crowned. The rest of the world is looking to obtain vibrainium and they are finding sources outside of Wakanda. ItÂ´s guarded by a tribe of people, now going to war with the surface world. ItÂ´s up to Shuri to make peace in Wakanda again.The CGI is not great here. Some aspects look fine like cities and underwater stuff but some of the models to later robots look so bad. It was so obvious it was fake. The villain also moves in a very unnatural way. I don't know if they had him on wires, but he looked very wired in post.The editing is fine until the last half of the movie. It has to cut between different battle scenarios, and it does this in a very unsatisfying and jarring way. The final battle is really hard to follow. The action within the scenes are fine but my eyes could simply not follow what was going on. The funniest thing that happened was something that annoyed my eyes and then I noticed it. It thought something looked weird in the final battle and itÂ´s because the aspect ratio is changing. It looks so unnatural, and the movie does not pull something like that off. It comes of as pretentious and too much. The color grading for the final fight also looks laudably cheap, like a fan film. The final fight of this movie is in general a big mess.There is a lot of songs used for this movie and at the end it felt extremely obnoxious. It came of as a beg for being nominated for best original song, just one of the 4 songs. While the songs are good and fits the movie, I would rather just have the incredible score. The songs really take over towards the end and to me, it really just came off as too much.The score in this movie is the best part of it. It sounds so unique and experimental. It feels like the movie has its own identity all of a sudden and the use of instruments not often heard is so good. I really loved this score to bits and vibed throughout the entire movie.The idea for the plot is fine, but it comes of as very uneventful, boring, and even a bit pointless. The entire conflict of this movie fells very stupid. It feels like a problem that doesn't need to be there and the villain and heroes' reasons to not solve the conflict and their ways of solving the conflict seem dumb and without reason.There are not really any characters that stand out to me. The two new main characters in this movie has no personality at all. Shuri fells like a really empty character and nothing like her prior incarnation. The new added girl character also really ads nothing but conflict and an empty performance. The acting overall is fine but nothing that I found noteworthy.The action seemed really mind numbing and without many stakes, highs, and lows. I felt very passive watching it and like no one was in real danger. In general, I felt very passive and like I tuned out of this movie. It felt like just flashing colors on the screen and I never really connected to the story at any time. While there was fun to be had and interesting things to see, it overall left me feeling nothing.I could not take the villain serious in this movie. They try to make him serious and cool, and his performance is good, but his design and powers made me laugh every time. ItÂ´s hard to translate a goofy character like this well, and to me they did not sell him to me.The costume design is so good here. Every character feels and looks distinct, and it carries over the tradition from its predecessor. ItÂ´s well detailed and amazing looking costumes.This could easily had been an incredible movie. It was all down to focus and even an obvious one right in front of you. This could have been a movie about mourning and finding your identity. It could have been a movie about traditions against innovations, but this movie plays it so safe it won't allow you to feel. The aspects mentioned are in the movie but on such a surface level it ends up meaning nothing.Now I was so afraid on how they would handle BosemanÂ´s passing and every time the movie was about to do something that could have been a respectless disaster to me, I cringed in fear. Luckily the movie plays this safe, UNTIL THE AFTERCREDITS. You might not have taken offense to what happened, and I understand that but to me, it was incredibly cringe and me and my girlfriend sat in disbelieve.This was a movie I sat through not really registering what was being presented. It was boring and uninteresting and without any form of substance. I just tuned out and was never really moved or engaged throughout the entire runtime.Oscar predictions: So this movie is nominated in 5 categories and letÂ´s take them one at a time. It can take costume design for me, but I think it has some tough competition from movies like Babylon and Elvis. I donÂ´t want it to take makeup and hairstyling as I think 3 movies nominated in this category displays the use of prosthetics and makeup better, and The Whale and Batman is probably in the forefront there. Original song is very tough this year and I donÂ´t know if Rihanna can take it over Gaga, the song was also fine, nothing too special. If Wakanda Forever wins best visual effects I would laugh, and itÂ´s going to lose to Avatar. And my hottest take, I donÂ´t see Angela Bassetts performance as anything special. ItÂ´s good, don't get me wrong but nothing that really touched me. Two speeches were good, and the rest was just there. I personally think Dania Gurira as Okoye did a better job in this movie. I know Bassett is in the lead right now, but I would rather have Stephanie Hsu win for Everything Everywhere all at Once for what IÂ´ve seen of the nominated supporting actresses and I could imagen I would want either Hong Chau or Kerry Condon to win when I see their performances in the Whale and Banshees respectively."

Language: English
Source: HotstarThis is K sequel for the great predecessor. Still the good CG work and moderate screenplay make it watchable.Lower your expectations as a regular action movie, you will not be disappointed. Other than some few extended cliche, the movie flow in good pace with decent action blocks.They added the story extension with another world and highly predictable climax. There are lot of mourning and one-to-one self realising conversations drag the move unnecessarily.With all these negatives, it is still watchable once... There is no after credits and no other Avenger continuance."
4," From boring to bad.
",ericblaylock,/user/ur35316991/,5 February 2023,The first two and a half hours were boring. All I could do was look for or notice the plot holes. Then came the climax and it just made the movie bad. Disney+ level CGI. Iron heart looked like CGI from the star wars prequels. Not to mention there was no emotional draw into the action. What's the point of action sequences anyways if it doesn't carry the story or at least the emotional beats? Climatic endings are supposed to get you invested in the characters. Glad I didn't watch this in theaters. I had to fast forward parts of this movie. Let's just hope ant-man doesn't let me down like the past 5 marvel movies have.
5," Should have used a water tank
",salamane,/user/ur23507746/,5 February 2023,"I could say a lot about the plot, and how really no one is the good guy here. Which makes it rather hard to care about any of this.But let's set that aside. The underwater cgi, was just bad. If you're going to shoot that much footage dish there, get a water tank, some freedive lessons, and do it right.You can't expect to release at the same time as Avatar, which has a new longest breath hold in a movie when you just bad cgi your underwater action.Say what you want about the two movies, with ridiculous metals that break science and have blue people...but at least one of them the actors could swim!"
4," Long and uninspiring
",tgrigg-82529,/user/ur153371740/,5 February 2023,"After the first movie was so good I had high hopes. But this movie was way too long, with no logical direction, and walked itself in circles for almost 3 hours. I didn't laugh, the fighting was cheesy, and the villain was forgettable. The tribute to Chadwick was good though, he will be missed. The choice of Shuri as the next black panther is logically inconsistent in the universe. She is the techy, not the fighter. Many better choices exist. This movie is also overly preachy. Also once you see this it's hard to unsee it, every male role in the story is either a dummy or a villain. There is no in between. There can be no competent and just male characters. None who are good at their job and working for the ""good guys"". It's great we have strong female characters, we can also have strong male characters at the same time."
7," Surprisingly...not bad at all
",dtstacey,/user/ur20644442/,5 February 2023,"Having seen some seemingly quite cringey trailers for this and looking at what they had done to 'Namor',I approached this with a bit of trepidation and was expecting to be chuckling at it for all the wrong reasons.... I was quite happy to be proved wrong. Okay,it was quite a somber film but it had to be after the sad passing of Mr Boseman but I thought it paid a good,touching farewell to him. I thought the narrative zipped along,in a logical fashion and I actually warmed to the 'Sub-Mariner',(..for it was he..). I liked this Character from 70's comics and remember him going toe-to-toe and actually stopping The Hulk,albeit with a lickle ,watery cheat so when I read that he was going to be stopped by a slip of a lass,albeit enhanced and kitted with a S. O. T. A suit,I prepared to be underwhelmed but am happy to report that it was well done,under the circumstances. Some superb visuals enhanced the fun and if I did roll my eyes once or twice it was at the thought of the replacement 'Iron Man' to be teen Latino minx building Vibranium detectors for a School Project and a 'IM' suit in her spare time,after being given a few tools by her back street mechanic dad,but hey!,its Marvel fantasy so let's roll with it...I actually found her quite engaging ditto Letitia who was nowhere near as annoying as I expected her to be and was probably the best actor in this,for me. Overall,a vast improvement over the first film which despite Mr Boseman's charisma I thought was a cut and paste quite boring generic actioner,(..ie like most of Marvel's current fare..),and the nearly 3 hours film zipped along in fine style. Credit where it is due...I really liked this one."

Everyone's a critic it seems.Im not a hard core comic nerd or anything but I love Marvel and anything super hero related and have seen them all. I thought it was honestly amazing! I loved the introduction of Talokan and Namor and his people. It gave something new and different. There was tons of action, rarely any dull moments and although Chadwick was very missed in it (definitely brought some tears when they showed clips of him) , Letitia and Angela carried it very well.People find anything to complain about it seems.

Michael B Jordon is great in this role.The final fight scene felt very anticlimactic, as a lot of MCU movies tend to do, but to me this one is right there in the Top 3 of all MCU phases movies.The ending was a nice tribute to Black Panther, Mr. Chadwick Boseman."

Why, in 2023, should anyone question a major purchase because of bad lighting? Hollywood is full of bad people.

So, maybe one person should've realized, after all the millions were spent, to turn on the lights."
5," Black Panther: Wakanda Forever
",Prismark10,/user/ur4569900/,5 February 2023,Black Panther was really Rocky 3. Directed by Ryan Coogler who rebooted the boxing franchise with Creed.Marvel bosses were left with a headache. Black Panther was a box office feline monster that snagged a best Picture Oscar nomination.The premature death of Chadwick Boseman meant a detour for the sequel.The movie begins with the death of King T'Challa. His mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett) takes over as Queen and she grieves for her son. A year later Ramonda believes she has lost her daughter Shuri (Letitia Wright.)She was on a mission in America to retrieve a young genius scientist Riri Williams still a MIT student. She has created a Vibranium detector that the Americans are using.It has disturbed a civilisation beneath the ocean led by Namor. They too have Vibranium technology and want Riri dead. His actions have brought pressure on Wakanda.The CIA believe that the Wakandans are to blame. Namor hates the surface people.The movie is a bloated mess. There was no going away from the fact the shock death of Boseman left Marvel Films with a creative headache.Letitia Wright who had to be kept off social media due to her ultra religious and anti vax views was never going to be a convincing replacement.Some of the scripting was bad. Agent Everett K Ross (Martin Freeman) finding something important as soon as he arrives at a crime scene when others who were there longer did not. Yet he did not smell a rat.The special effects looked shoddy as well. I did not expect such obvious CGI in places.
1," A Disappointing and Uninspired Film Experience
",yeasinjabed,/user/ur161998395/,5 February 2023,"I recently watched a movie that I would rate with a 1-star rating. The movie had high expectations, but unfortunately, it was a complete disappointment. The plot was unoriginal and lacked depth. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any real personality. The dialogue was clunky and forced, making it difficult to connect with the characters on any level.The special effects were underwhelming and at times seemed like they were done on a shoestring budget. The pacing of the movie was slow and dull, which made it a real struggle to sit through the entire thing. The soundtrack was uninspiring and forgettable, adding nothing to the overall experience of the movie.The acting was subpar, with most of the actors delivering wooden performances that failed to bring any life to their characters. The casting was also a problem, with actors who seemed miscast for their roles, making it even more difficult to become invested in the story.Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It was a waste of time and money and failed to deliver on almost every level. I was greatly disappointed by the movie and feel that it was a major letdown compared to other films in the same genre. If you're looking for a good movie experience, I would suggest skipping this one and finding something else to watch."
5," That sure was a movie...
",hmschlof,/user/ur158051238/,5 February 2023,"That was a movie, all right. No one can say it wasn't. A good movie? Eh...
But a movie, nevertheless..
Required Characters? Okay...
That sure did happen. I am glad I didn't pay extra for a movie ticket.Mediocre, at best.A lot of stuff happened. Nobody cared, because everyone was too busy missing Chadwick Boseman. Way too long. Way too much filler. OHMYLORD. I still haven't hit the minimum word count? How many times do you want me to say mediocre, too long for a tribute to Chadwick Boseman (at 2 hours and 38 minutes) and suddenly became Avatar:The way of water out of nowhere. For as great as the first movie was, I was expecting much more."
6," Could have been better
",Vclfx,/user/ur149471933/,5 February 2023,"I had a lot of regards on who would they follow Black Panter after Chadwick death. I was given the spoiler of whom would became the next Black Panther and honestly, i was scared on how would they follow this movie since the current set of events.I did like a lot of things during the movie; some decisions where well made and fit for the situations presented, the visuals as always was stunning and the songs are beatifull.Angela Bassett performance carries most of the movies in here back with amazing acting.And, the homenage to Chadwick Boseman was really powerfull.That all being said... It could have been so much better. This movie had soo much pootential that i felt lost to bad writting and proper direction.A lot of things felt lost in the story, and some motivations where missing. The first half of the movie seems to lost the concept of how powerfull Wakanda was in the first movie and in the Avengers series. The old plot ""the villan overcome our high tech defenses easily and we don't now how"" is just bad. Some really important characters put themselfs at high risks situations with zero reasons and some actions had zero consequences during the movie.Not to mention the ""brilliant"" ideia in the end of the movie that uses the strengh of the enemy in their behalf.I kinda liked the movie as a casual movie you would watch on a friday night, but considering the history behind it, it could have been better."

",jmillenbach-09526,/user/ur70699589/,5 February 2023,"Sadly I understand what they're talking about well enough to know that they don't understand it. Or are purposefully being obtuse/wrong?It's ""diffie q's"" aka 'diff. Eq.s' not ""differential equations"".I've yet to ever see a ""2065"" bit encryption key. Computers are based on binary, and lots of things work best on them in multiples of 2 like 2048, 1024, 512... Every once in a while something odd happens like the 140 bit encryption, but that's a rarity. Here I think they looked at current recommendations, doubled them and fudged the value for no good reason (more is better, right?).You don't drop random balls in AR then ask the computer to grade you (to save your brother). If your can instantly measure the validity of a solution you have the computer create lots of random attempts then use genetic algorithms to work around local minima.Yeah it's hard to make science look interesting or worthwhile to action fans. Maybe I'm just not the target audience here...I appreciate a number of unusual things they attempted in the Wakandan culture. But it just feels like a bunch of superficial tweaks. They're still led by a king/queen. If they were truly as advanced as they claim they wouldn't need to be authoritarian. People would do what should be done.I get tired of seeing various people's supposedly futuristic versions of reality that feel like today in all the ways that matter. ""Yes general."" ""I was only doing what I was ordered to do."" etcI'm guessing because those with power don't want people to think. They imagine they're the reason for all the successes, but blame others for any failure."
5," Really Wanted it to be Great
",kagevw,/user/ur63209600/,5 February 2023,"I really wanted Wakanda Forever to be a great successor to the first movie, which is one of my favorite Marvel movies ever, but it just fell flat. Unfortunately this movie falls into the pattern of regency that Marvel has had since the COVID pandemic began, big aspirations, no real effort into reaching them. The story manages to follow the same trope as all marvel movies, which is nothing spectacular anymore. The introduction of the ""Atlantean-esque"" people was something I was really looking forward to, but it never really felt like it was given the attention a big introduction like this deserved. The characters themselves were all lackluster, especially the introduction of Iron Heart, who felt like she shouldn't have even been there. I'm blown away that this movie was nominated for Oscars, even the CGI was visibly bad in some scenes. Definitely worth a watch for marvel fans, but really don't expect anything spectacular and game changing like the first movie."
1," Sad to see Marvel die on that hill
",Holden_Reach,/user/ur20341900/,5 February 2023,"Fascist Wakanda ursuping a native South American nation is really the last nail in the coffin of Marvel's cinematic universe. Catastrophic failure is putting it mildly.I do understand that in real life the bad guys often enough win, but if I watch a Marvel movie I don't want the bad guys to win. Wakanda attacking an innocent nation, murdering many and getting away with it in the end is unacceptable to me. Also, I thought blank Panter did in the past a fair job giving Africans a representation in cinema. Letting the Africans play the role of the white slavers that dominates South American nations is now a great disservice to the African continent. I find it quite scandalous. Particularly considering that the movie was made by a nation that exterminated the North American natives. First commit genocide and then make a movie in which you paint a completely unrelated people (Africans) as evil as yourself. Probably to feel better about yourself. Quite distasteful."

6," Messy story, feels hastely made...
",micglou,/user/ur55150621/,4 February 2023,"I expected more of this movie. Right from the start the movie looked hastely made... the set during the T'Challa funeral looked hastely; the buidlings looked fake and cheap, the street looked like it was made an hour before and wasn't even completely finished. And this actually kinda continued throughout the movie. It looked like most of the budget went to the special effects, but as soon some real scenery was in front of the camera it looked cheap and unfinished.Story also felt messy, the basis of it is great but they rushed through everything... and they still made a movie over 2,5 hours long. Also even though Letitia Wright did a great job with her character in the first movie, the character itself and her screen presence isn't strong enough to carry a movie like this. It is a bad choice making her the Black Panther, Lupita Nyong'o would've been a much better choice to end up as the Black Panther, much better actress and stronger screen presence.Angela Bassett though... what a regal woman she is, she carried the movie until her death. 60+ years old but looking fit, strong and gorgeous and she poured everything into her character."
2," Dimished the first movie...long and boring...storyline baffling!
",garymckenna-15770,/user/ur161991731/,4 February 2023,I was hesitant to watch this as I really really loved the first movie and without chadwick was concerned this would lose its edge. How right I was it was a meandering storyline with no depth the characters from the first movie became superficial and shallow. The storyline made no sense how and why another empire existed without such a technological society such as wakanda not knowing was just baffling. The cgi is great but it was not enough to cover for such a poor story. I need to watch the first movie again to rekindle the love I had for this movie and try and forget this. Don't waste your time on this the first movie deserves a much better sequel and this was not it.
7," So dark!
",ARByars,/user/ur150135164/,4 February 2023,"The tribute at the beginning was beautifully done. It was so dark that it was like watching a black screen and listening to the movie. We lost interest about 20 minutes into it because we couldn't see anything. It would have been a great story if we could see it. This seems to be a trend with movies lately- I'd like to be able to SEE the actors. I'd like to SEE the costumes, special effects and sets. Storyline was decent but again- not able to see a thing made it hard to focus on. Martin Freeman is great as always. The Wakanda cast are all talented women- would have loved to SEE their faces. Meh."
5," What an overhyped, garbage movie
",osalim,/user/ur65999898/,4 February 2023,"This movie was a pale shadow to the first movie. Granted the first movie was not a classic, but it had so much more going for it than this one. Chadwick Boseman made the role his own and the story was good. This movie had a rubbish storyline, the villain was not convincing enough, the final battle was lackluster and could not compare with the one in the first movie and Shuri was made Black Panther in the end really? A girl who didnt earn the title and had no credibility was made protector of Wakanda. If the director was smart, he would have let the movie die and not made a sequel.This movie did well at the box office but righly underperformed when compared to the first. Only reason this movie made $800million at the box office is because ""Marvel"" die hard fans flocked in droves out of ""curiosity"" to see how this film would turn out but probably were disappointed by it. Considering it didnt make as much money as the first. It is astonishing it has a 7/10 on IMDB. This movie is a solid 5 and im glad i didn't waste my money watching it in a Cinema. This is an insult to Boseman's memory. If the Director makes a third, the film would struggle to make $500million at the box office, simple as that. Marvel's time is up, i have yet to see a good movie since Avengers concluded!"
3," Black Panther: Way of the Water
",asgoins-93322,/user/ur107195788/,4 February 2023,"Truly one of the worst Marvel movies made this far. The Eternals gets a bad rap, but the plotline of this movie was so much worse. ""Hey, we can be friends."" ""Oh wait, no we can't, let's fight!"" ""Okay, okay, we can be friends."" The End. The CIA plot went nowhere other then to drive home that Americans are the greatest threat, even though they depicted other nations at the UN as the aggressors. Martin's character was a wimp and did nothing. As far as the Black Panther is concerned, the whole process was ignored and she instantly becomes Black Panther without ritual, ceremony, and all of a sudden when convenient. The only cool scene of the entire movie was the dive down to the city, but I've seen these scenes in Aquaman, Avatar, and various others. I could also go on about the Iron Man type suits and that dumb plotline, but I think we can all agree that it was a rip off and only a signal to say, ""Hey, black girls can get into STEM, too!"" Which is true, but I'd suggest making a better movie if you really want to encourage that."
10," Better than expected!
",shareen_shany,/user/ur55959137/,4 February 2023,"This film is not the usual Marvel film. This is different, its more matured, its about love, forgiving & healing. It dedicated to Chadwick B.Its not too slow neither its too fast. It has the right tempo. It tells a story, how vengeance eats you up & make a hole that you can repair.It still has Marvel concept, superhero, humour & the works!Totally awesome performance from the Queen, Shuri, Okeye, Nokia & the Mexican actor!Expected that this film to be cartoony like Thor the god of love & thunder, that is a waste of time & money to watch but this was worthy!The ending with the memory of Chadwick brings tears. Lovely memories of him!Glad I watch it!"
6," It's just a vehicle for the third movie of the Black Panther saga!!
",li0904426,/user/ur28425280/,4 February 2023,"The movie ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is certainly not the action movie the Marvel Studios audience expects, with fewer fights, chases, and explosions and a lot of talk, explanation, and revelations. It's a mix of Aquaman with the original Black Panther.The movie has a sharp break between the futuristic world of Wakanda and the city of Talokan with the realistic world of the United States (""...catch a Bull's game later...""), it doesn't sound natural. Also, it seems that director Ryan Coogler and the writers made this film just to prepare for the third sequence of the Black Panther saga, it has all the ingredients for the next project, especially the ending."
7," This was Shuri's story - Ok but not best entry
",donnagrei,/user/ur61883926/,4 February 2023,"I believe a lot of the haters will hate on this because this Black Panther sequel became very much Shuri's story. Or, Shuri and the women of Wakanda perhaps.Actually shifting the focus to the powerful women of Wakanda is one of the things I liked about this film and story. But overall, it just wasn't a GREAT story period. Instead of a sequel we got another origin story - this time for the scientific minded Shuri - and the problem is she just wasn't suited to be the Black Panther. I think the writers did what they could given the circumstances of the untimely passing of its star. And in a way, it made SENSE, but it also ended up feeling like a bridge story and that was unfortunate.Nevertheless there are some good moments, and some sad moments that are much more of a downer than a typical Marvel movie. Initially, I liked the introduction of Namor and the underwater city, which was visually appealing. But again, Marvel wastes a villain on a rather petty dispute that could've been solved had they all just calmed the F down, as it was obvious the girl had not intended to harm anyone with her machine. Bizzare and useless plot!"
," ""It looks like there's a tree blocking the road""...
",olavinto_,/user/ur6395591/,4 February 2023,"...said the driver of a prison transport van when he stopped in front of a tree blocking the road. Dude, when you have to stop, there IS a tree blocking the road. Obviously it helps to get out of the car to walk a couple of meters next to the tree to see that it actually is one the road... Logic got left behind. To me, small details matter a lot and this movies is full of things like the afore mentioned situation. A new interesting and very powerfull race is immediately made into an enemy that just wants to wipe everyone of the map for the stupidest reason ever. No one mentions or tries to do any research into who they actually are or even asks them when their leader is first encountered either. Negotiations are not even mentioned and almost evrything is decided in the blink of an eye, on both sides. I do not remember the Wakandans being so full of themselves and the enemy isn't any better. These huge, advanced and old societies that have existed in peace for ages, they sure are quick to go to war...There's a lot of dialogue that is way overscripted/too complicated and rarely does anyone have regular sounding conversations. It's like everyone is in constant conflict with each other. Surprisingly M'Baku is basically the only major character who shows any restraint and actually stops to think and calmly expresses at least some alternatives (after he has experienced the strenght of the enemy).The traditions and rituals that gave Wakanda a unique identity in the first movie are mostly discarded (I guess that this is mainly because Suri is a modern techie who doesn't believe/cate about them and only trusts in her tech and she constantly rebels and acts out like a bloody teenager) and what little there is lacks any comparable depth.The best parts are probably the those that are dedicated to T'Challa and Chadwick Boseman and they have a few quite emltional scenes. Outside of those there's too much going on here, rgere, everywhere, and nothing has any true substance. Some parts are also way too fairytaly.Sadly, the movie lacks the charisma and talent of Chadwick Boseman. Winston Duke could have filled that hole with his powerful presence but he is utilized even less than before even when he has a major role in the current government. Instead the focus is on our techie girl and I she would have worked much, much better if she had stayed in that role. I have nothing against female hero's but Wakanda Forever feels more like some Disney cartoon aimed for young teenagers and it's way too nice, simple and a even bit childish.The first one had much more serious tone and it was also a lot better thought out. I'm suprised that this was written and directed by the same people because this felt completely different. This is easily one of the most boring MCU movies to date I'm sad to say."
6," A few poor choices moved this from average to bad
",vikcyru,/user/ur78338530/,4 February 2023,"I really wanted to like this film. Loved how the protagonist switched to Shuri. Love the banter between some of the characters. But some massive plot holes and decisions have made this movie flawed in a way which my mind couldn't reconcile. The largest of which was the killing of Queen Ramonda. Unnecessary when after Chadwick Boseman's death the movie was already supercharged with the emotion of death and loss.Killing queen Ramonda made the final scene which should have been the most emotional in the entire MCU franchise confusing to me. Why was she grieving her brother and not her more recent loss of her mother. Movies that can successfully bridge the gap between reality and fiction are so strong but this one made some epically poor decisions and botched it.The enemy was also confusing. Mayans exploited by colonisers - GO! Dudes who wanna thanos the world - NO! Winged feet and ability to hover and fly faster than aircraft - YO! Lose to Black Panther due to not being able to breathe air? OH NO! Peace treaty? Wtf?I get the mercy angle - but the character was too confusing and lacked significant depth or gravitas.The one joke about suits was cool but out of place in a character who was overly serious but looked well.... Comical.A new young scientist with an iron man suit. Cool.I thought Okoye's performance was the most powerful, and Shuri did well - likeable character. Angela Basset's loss will be felt - but the series has the potential to turnaround after a movie which has to be seen as a disappointment overall."
5," Shame on you Marvel.
",dreamflite-45735,/user/ur98324565/,4 February 2023,I will always miss Chadwick Bosman and they did pay homage. They at least did that right.It was overall a good movie with the exception of two lines in reference to a white person being called a colonizer. Why would you mar one of the only powerful female black role models that's part of Marvel movie arena with something like that? This is a movie that is watched by children and helps create the foundation of what is acceptable human behavior. Having characters that are incredibly grounded and looked up to by children everywhere say something so politically incorrect and devisive is something that blew me away. It made me hot with anger. It did a disservice to an absolutely wonderful movie. The teachings of working with one another and treating each other with respect is so incredibly important.I am wincing at the thought of hearing kids at school being called colonizers because of the color of their skin and feeling the hate of something they were not even a part of. Such ignorance Marvel. Shame on you.
7," Wakanda forever
",Cinema-reviewer321,/user/ur118439842/,4 February 2023,"I did like the first Black Panther movie of 2018. So, after the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman I was interested in how Black panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) was going to do without him in the leading role for the movie.It is hard for me to say if Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) is as good as the first or better, because I liked this second movie a lot. The acting in this movie is what makes this movie good, along with great emotional moments.Letitia Wright as Shuri was great in her performance and the way the character acted was nice to watch. I did believe her as someone who not only lost a king but her own brother, along with the queen of Wakanda played by Angela Bassett giving a believable performance as someone who has lost a lot of people in her life.I liked Namor the Sub-mariner played by Tenoch Huerta and thought the Namor character was threatening but was also trying hard to keep the underwater city Talokan safe, along with him looking cool flying around with the wings on his feet. Plus, I like the introduction of Riri Williams/Ironheart in this movie and how she is part of the plot of the movie.The action scenes are cool to watch and fun, and I like how they play out in the story. This movie has effective emotional moments that genuinely made me cry at times from how well handled it was, also the after credits scene was emotionally well handled and might make you cry.Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) was a good sequel to the first Black Panther movie. It has great acting, great action, effective emotional moments, some funny moments, and it has a great tribute to both Chadwick Boseman and his character T'Challa that will tug on your heart strings."

",mossikukulas-21314,/user/ur80906229/,4 February 2023,"I don't know why they ended up with such a badly written convoluted film.. I really wanted to like this but it was such a convoluted non-sensical plot with minimal black panther content, a very bizarre origin story for Namor and overall a very disappointing final act that reminded me a bit of a Power Rangers episode.. Sometimes I wonder why do I even bother watching these films.I'm giving it 3/10 because of the good production value and a wonderful scene at the middle of the scene with a wonderful musical score. You'll know when you'll see it.Other than that it was a complete disappointment with redundant characters, characters that were introduced because they'll get a spin-off and I just despair at the state of the MCU in general."
3," Not very good.
",hemisphere65-1,/user/ur21552176/,4 February 2023,"Without Boseman, there is no cast member capable of carrying a major movie like this one. Letitia Wright is not a good enough actress to be the main character and Angela Bassett has gotten worse over the years. Such a one-note performance as the queen, which was made worse by awful dialogue and weak storylines.The Riri character is a welcome addition, along with the long overdue Namor, but neither intro was very good.The SFX were good, of course, but some of the cgi backgrounds looked incomplete. The movie would have been more tolerable at about 110 minutes, because the other hour or so added nothing."
4," Not what I thought it was
",toviadomus,/user/ur70131987/,4 February 2023,"It was bad. It was bad enough that I thought they should've hired another actor to play the lead role. Without giving it to a girl who's not ready and not impressive. Plus all. The talented and interesting charchters are dead now. Tchalla, killmomger, klaue, the queen ramonda king tchaka his right hand man. I dont think they saw the bigger picture or what will be left of it after last 2 black panther movies. No one interesting is left. By this movie a major storyline on the level of ironman got sidelined. Black panther fell to the lot of Eternals. And it does feel like forever with getting nowhere storyline."
6," Disappointing.
",bowmanj-68191,/user/ur75739609/,4 February 2023,"Marvel movies are running out of ideas. The first black panther was much better. This one seems to lose direction, move slowly and overabue cgi. Character development is poor and it's hard to develop any opinion whatsoever regarding Namor. The plot is plodding and the drama doesn't hit home. They attempt an homage to Chadwick Boseman which is the best part of the movie but it actually seems overdone, as they do something at the start and again at the end. Overall a lot of effects, suits and gadgets but too little substance. I definitely feel like this and the multiverse of madness were real let downs. They could have easily cut 20-30 minutes out of this movie and been better for it. Hopefully the next phase of the MCU comes back stronger."

5," Slow paced and way too long...
",paul_haakonsen,/user/ur22654354/,4 February 2023,"While I am not overly keen on superhero movies, then I still watch them when able, as they tend to be visually impressive movies. And superhero movies also tend to be movies where you just switch off the brain, lean back and munch on a snack while watching the action, something that is required to unwind from time to time.I found the 2018 ""Black Panther"" movie to be adequately entertaining, so of course I also opted to watch the 2022 sequel ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" as I had the opportunity. Though such a movie is hardly worth a cinema admission ticket in my opinion.""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" was not as entertaining as the 2018 predecessor. The narrative in ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" was simply too montonous, slow paced and dragged on for a long time whilst setting up the stage for a showdown between Wakanda and Namor. Lots of talking and character building going on for about two-thirds of the movie, and the showdown was the final third act of the movie. While the action and fighting was fun to watch, it didn't make up for the long two-thirds that laid before it.It was becoming a struggle to keep focus on the screen and keep being interested in the narrative here, at least for me, since there wasn't enough of any action in the first two-thirds of the movie. I was expecting a Marvel superhero movie with lots of action and punches being thrown, and I wasn't in the mindset for a political drama with a lot of character building and setting the stage.The acting performances in the movie were good, but the movie was suffering from not having Chadwick Boseman in the role as the Black Panther. It should be noted, though, that the cast ensemble was good and they had a lot of talented actors and actresses on the cast list.Visually then ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" was good, as Marvel superhero movie usually are. So at least tyou're in for a visual treat. But visuals can only do so much for lifting up a lacking narrative.Running at 2 hours and 41 minutes, and without a properly entertaining script, then ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" was a long and somewhat monotonous affair to sit through. So I guess the 'forever' part of the title was a hint at the narrative as well.""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is a movie for the fans of the superhero genre, no doubt about it. And for us casual viewers, it was somewhat of a stale foray into the ""Black Panther"" franchise.My rating of director Ryan Coogler's 2022 movie ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" lands on a five out of ten stars."
5," Too long....just so long
",atleverton,/user/ur154032493/,4 February 2023,"I watched this movie with no great expectations. I think for most people, the attraction of the MCU has faded. It's not surprising after the over saturation of the content over the past few years. I think last year there were six tv shows and four movies. And honestly, I've never been a huge fan of the characters. But I have to admit that there are two things that Marvel does well...emotionally resonant scenes and big action. Wakanda Forever had both. It was far too long, and I think this was affected by the premature death of Chadwick Boseman. It was hard to balance an emotional story of farewell to that character with an absurd one of fish-people being angry with Wakanda. This leads me to my biggest problem with the portrayal of Wakanda, and the fish people in the MCU. Vibranium is supposed to give both countries this amazing technological advantage over the rest of the world to the extent that major powers like the US are afraid of Wakanda, and yet when they actually do fight-their warriors line up in ranks like it's 1435. Where are the tanks? The heavy guns? The missiles? They do have jet like things. It just seems like strategically, if the Wakandans every did go to war with a country like the US, it would be a massacre. And the fish people are even worse. They have no advanced technology whatsoever. And yet they are able to catch Wakanda by surprise. While it was an enjoyable watch, it was too long."
8," Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Impresses after some underwhelming marvel projects
",ashnasmam,/user/ur121041615/,4 February 2023,"I was thrilled with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever after some disappointing offerings from Marvel. It captivates with its mature and impactful story and a fitting tribute to Chadwick Boseman. The film's focus on the drama and future of Wakanda elevates it beyond a mere visual spectacle. In addition, the stunning visuals and incredible action sequences complement the film's thought-provoking story, making for an unforgettable cinematic experience. The film's depiction of Wakanda, a technologically advanced and culturally rich African nation, is nothing short of breathtaking, and I found myself drawn in by its world-building. Overall, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever exceeded my expectations and I can't wait to see what the future holds for the franchise."""
3," What have they done??
",andrewcallow,/user/ur33431355/,4 February 2023,"Terrible movie!Underwater people storyline is weak weak weak, and not only has no real direction, but it's completely diverged from the Marvel 'Universe' coherence of the different hero storylines.Shuri (Letitia Wright) as the new Black Panther..... well, having a female hero is the new correctness norm of trying to capture the female viewing population, and may have worked - if she looked like she could be a hero. Watching the early part of the movie she looks emaciated with no muscle on her arms whatsoever, which is completely against any logic of a superhero - all the male leads have way more muscle and an athletic physique that is way beyond the average man, which adds credibility to their strength and capabilities.Since Disney took over the Marvel Universe, they have dumbed down the storylines and trashed what made these heroes and the Universe great in the first place.Poor Stan Lee must be turning in his grave at this corruption of his legacy."
7," Angela Bassett is the highlight
",snoozejonc,/user/ur120966602/,4 February 2023,"Vibranium is discovered under the Atlantic Ocean and it causes problems for Wakanda.Reasonably good sequel with some standout moments.The strongest aspects are the character moments for the likes of Ramonda, Shuri, and Nakia as they contend with various obstacles whilst mourning the loss of T'Challa. I particularly enjoyed the scenes involving Ramonda because Angela Bassett is so magnetic on screen and Letitia Wright does good job of leading the majority of the film.I like the concept of the Talokan and this aspect of the story plays out to a fairly logical conclusion. It's good that certain arcs are left open for future stories, but for me it slightly retreads familiar ground to the original by involving Wakanda in another conflict with an aggrieved supervillain looking to right the wrongs of history.Where I struggle is the general pacing and length of the story. There is some material that stretches the screen time for the sake of franchise expansion. With the 'Ironheart' streaming show on the horizon, plus other movies, this story has to introduce certain characters and continue the arcs of others and for it me this adds a bloated corporate feel to it. Also a lot of dialogue is dedicated to exposition.A big positive is the cinematography and art design. There are so many cinematic shots and beautifully coloured imagery from Wakanda. Plus Talokan is brought to life extremely well.As with many Marvel movies I have grown tired of the extended action spectacle. I think this movie is another example as so much of it is very familiar, such as Ironman type suits flying about with cuts to faces inside the helmets and Wakandans in cool car chases on foreign soil. Other sequences feel quite cartoonishly over the top.It's a 6.5/10 for me but I round upwards."
6," I wanted to like this more
",djdogmanfish,/user/ur51526919/,4 February 2023,"This has alot of the right ingredients to make a great movie. Before I really get into my review I have to acknowledge that making this film into a masterpiece was a daunting task given the loss of Chadwick Boseman, and it's so hard to replicate how incredible the first movie was. At times I found my attention starting to drift, so there were times where I had to rewind to catch up on what I missed.The biggest hit to this film is the runtime. This movie is so loooooong. There was so much good in it, I like the backstory of Namor's people. I think we could have slimmed down several parts, like the Cambridge section, for example. The action scenes are also a downgrade for me, there's just not much in the way of memorable action.I have to praise the acting and the world building. Angela Bassett commands so many great scenes. Letitia Wright really steps up as a lead. I was hesitant going in, but she really does an impressive job. The attention to detail in both Wakanda and Talokan just blew my mind. The love and care given to Meso-American culture was beautiful.I wish I could give it more stars. Alot of thought came into the making of this film, it just missed the mark."
3," Bad Panther
",Martipee,/user/ur33628252/,4 February 2023,"Seems to be a common practice for Marvel to produce mega-expensive 3-star movies these days. Lots of CGI, black-bro humour and African tribal dancing, but lacking heavily in any real storyline. Nothing surprising or unexpected in the 2.5+hrs of viewing time meaning you're not missing out on anything except 2.5+ hrs of your own time.James Gunn has a fantastic opportunity to view the Marvel timeline of its characters at DC and their current failures to produce movies worthy of paying to see. How hard can it be when the comics of yesterday are there to guide you. DC should be rubbing their hands together, hopefully, and could on the cusp of success at what Marvel once had, but has now seen to have lost."
1," Wakanda never again
",mauricebonn,/user/ur58947098/,4 February 2023,"This was a terrible movie, not Marvel worthy. What makes Marvel movies strong in the past is humour, lively and interesting cast, mature action and a immersive story. None of these where represented in this one. While watching Wakanda I got the impression I was watching a kids movie, bad acting, sorry for that and an awful script. Not my cup of tea, though I think some kids younger than 12 might have found it entertaining. It lacks the passion and the very strong storytelling of others Marvels. Is Marvel lossing theit touch? Hope they reallly come up with more engaging content soon. Quickly forget Wakanda and on to the next,"
10," In the rare tradition of masterful sequels
",TheBlackTulip,/user/ur11593311/,4 February 2023,"I, in my over forty years of being a cinephile of sorts, have very seldom experienced good sequels. Even when they're good solid works, rarely a continuation of an original idea, surpasses said previous work, in any way, technical or otherwise. This film had me crying one minute, jumping, rooting for the heroes the next, falling in love with the many profound messages throughout, and then having myself another cry. I've written only a couple of these reviews, and I very much doubt anyone will read this one. It's ok I'm doing it not for any audience, but as thank you to the creators, writers, director, and so on, because in the same way they have made a truly magnificent tribute to a great actor, human being, artist, and altogether ""best of us""guy, Mr. Chadwick, this movie allowed me to contemplate for an instant how, having lost my mother very recently to cancer, it's in the works, actions, steps, and what we do, how we honor those very dear to us who have passed. Thank you, you have outdone yourselves in every way possible, and in these times when it's so common for comic book adaptations to be anything but outstanding, again this experience has been transcendental, key, and I believe historical in setting an example, for works to come. A very moved, and wholehearted 10 out of 10."
1," Marvel is self-destructing & this is long overdue.
",ophid-56353,/user/ur161966180/,4 February 2023,"Yes. It is that bad.Not quite as bad as WW'84, but still a total waste of everyone's time and money.If Marvel could possibly wrap any more tinsel around their product there wouldn't be any foil left for anyone else to roast a turkey.This should be, has to be, must be - the last turkey.It's so bad that even Patty Jenkins could've done a better job. And that's saying something.(OK - I seem to have fallen short of the 'character count' to post).What 'counts' for character in the MCU is just a tinsel facade of generic hero stereotypes - designed to fleece impressionable teenagers from their money.So now it's been demonstrated that anyone can arrogate/appropriate anyone else's culture - and prostitute those cultures for their own profit.This is exactly what Marvel does. They do not care - as long as it rakes in billions.(Hey - my 'minimum character limit' is met ! ).Can't be bothered with this MCU garbage anymore."
3," Completely disappointed
",dimitargegov,/user/ur76232940/,4 February 2023,"What a waste of time. I cannot believe that I am disappointed but I am. When you hear that movie name I expect action and a nice story but I dont see such thing here. Also leaving a women to do the action does not fit to this black panter character, It not an action movie any more. It becomes more like a black cat and comedy. Completely a joke. More of the time the movie is like during the night time and there is no colors and can get pleasure of the movie, its more like a horor which I will never forget that waste me more then two hours of my life. I am never writing a reviews for movies but this one made me do it."
5," Black Panther: Wakanda Forever
",henry8-3,/user/ur0351766/,4 February 2023,"From the outset the spirit of Chadwick Boseman and the the Black Panther looms large here. After T'Challa dies of a disease despite Shuri's (Letitia Wright) attempt to find a cure from some 'heart shaped herb' the world becomes interested in getting its hands on vibranium. An attempt to take vibranium by force fails but awakes an underwater group of super humans who hold Wakanda responsible and a battle between the 2 powers begins.There is quite a lot to admire in this spectacular sequel which though is delivered as a rather sad epitaph to T'Challa - there are very few laughs here. It is impressive, effects wise, although we are accustomed to that now and the performances particularly from Angels Bassett are solid. I also liked that like the first film there is a blurring around who is bad and who isn't and that this time the Americans are all shown as crazed republicans deciding vibranium must belong to them because they're American - a nice touch.However, there are things that I wasn't keen on, namely:
Every MCU film now has to find someone who has greater powers than the last film and here it is the underwater guys - who seem to come fresh out of 'Avatar: The Way of Water' - and who seem all powerful and invincible, until they're not,Martin Freeman and Julia-Louis Dreyfus seem to bring nothing to the storyIt is too longThe inevitable climactic battle is a bit meh, with the underwater guys and their flying feathered feet, rather daft but countered by everyone from Wakanda wearing increasingly ridiculous outfits.It's fine - worth a look."
4," I expected more
",solangedesousa,/user/ur161963432/,4 February 2023,"It isn't a terrible movie. I was expecting more goose bumps, open mouth, wide eyed moments. Sometimes these moments are only a few seconds, other times they are a whole scene. They had so many opportunities to make this happen. Especially with this movie. With so many emotions around this strong kingdom, the death of the prince they loved so much and the rebirth of their hero they thought was lost forever.Then we have the issue of the new jelly fish looking suit and the far inferior iron man suit. It seems to me that too much time was wasted on areas that didn't need it and not enough to where it was."
5," Just BADLY written
",rallder19,/user/ur25290547/,4 February 2023,"This movie makes no sense whatsoever.Let's break it down...A scientist (Riri) invents a thing that can detect Vibranium.. government uses it to locate vibranium in Atlantis.. Atlantians destroy them like they're ants.. Namor asks Wakanda to help them locate and kill the scientist responsible for making the machine.. he does this so that he can keep his city safe from outsiders.. Namor tries forming a bond with Shuri and brings her to Atlantis.. Namor gives Wakanda an ultimatum which is that they kill Riri so she can't build another machine or Wakanda join them in eliminating the outside threat... Wakanda, instead, decides to save/protect Riri.. Namor sees no choice but to destroy Wakanda to keep his city safe since Shuri now knows its location.. Namor is 100000% confident he can wipe Wakanda off the board because, as he says, ""I have more soldiers than you have blades of grass in Wakanda""So let's unpack this. The WHOOOOLLLEE point of this movie is a war between Atlantis and Wakanda. Namor starts the war to keep Atlantis safe.. from who?... from WHO? The thick headed government that he flicked off his shoulder like it was nothing? Or the most advanced country in the world who he is certain he can wipe off his boot like an ant? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ were the writers just napping all day? Who exactly just makes it through this whole movie without realizing how ridiculous the entire premise is..any stars I give are towards visuals/costumes/cinematography/etc. Basically anything but the writing. Writing gets a solid 1 out of 10."
5," First Marvel ""chick flick"" mediocre
",jwag777,/user/ur2029853/,4 February 2023,"I have to say, this movie felt like it was written by a couple of 30 something-year olds. Oh, that's right, it was. I only say that because the plot was pretty simplistic and predictable. Not a whole lot of imagination. That said, it was pretty well directed (by one of the screenwriters) and overall fairly entertaining. But not without it's problems.First off, Disney/Marvel Studios continues to push it's dominate female/sub-ordinate male policy, which is nearly in all of their recent movies now. This one perhaps more than any other. It's very obvious, and starting to get a little old. I applaud their changing their way to introduce stronger female characters, which was overdue, but not in every movie they make. Just not realistic.Something else that grew old was how the Watanda folks always conveniently had the right weapon or tool to get them out of whatever bind they were in. To the point where you start saying to yourself ""come on already""!The choice of for the ""new"" Black Panther was a bit unrealistic. Sure, she drank something that made her strong, but where did her super-hero level fighting abilities come from? And I mean super, as she somehow went from Wakanda scientist to the defeater of her truly super hero opponent. An opponent who earlier in the movie was destroying everything and everyone he faced, but then suddenly forgot how to fight. And why fight on land when he was 30 yards from the ocean where he could have easily deposited his air-breathing opponent into, heavily putting the odds on his side. But no. What ended up happening wouldn't have happened.Did like the introduction to Namor, or the ""Sub-Mariner"" as he is known to us older Marvel fans. However, the casting of him was terrible. Although a good actor, 5'8"", semi-fit Tenoch Huerta is not the Namor of the comics. Not even close. The original Namor is much taller, fit, and definitely not a Latin American. But this wouldn't be the first time Marvel Studios went completely against how a character was conceived by it's creator decades earlier. And I hate to say it, but we're seeing it even more after Stan Lee died. You don't need to look any further than to see the bozo that Thor has turned into.The last thing I'm going to say about this movie is actually a recommendation: turn on subtitles. We had a hard time understanding many of the actors because of their thick accents."

A great tribute to the Black Panther but i did not find this story believeble... The story did not grab me... Only the opening scene, when the queen passed and the last scÃ¨ne... The rest was not a well thought out story like all the Marvel movies usually do... I dont know i wanted to love it so bad but i was waiting for that one big scene where it would grab you but it did not .. i actually fell a sleep at some point.

",dbuckshnis,/user/ur66045776/,4 February 2023,"This is my only second marvel movie, which took the first one was Black Panther. And I just watched that three days ago and really enjoyed it.There was a lot of fighting and a lot of conflict in the switch was OK but it seemed to drag on a lot and I think they could've had the fight scenes, more concise or at least not so over the top with the same folks fighting. I also found it weird that the water God would want to take on the surface world and expose themselves.It was a really nice tribute to Chadwick Bozeman and that I enjoyed as well as knowing that he has an heir.The costumes are fabulous as is the futuristic world shot with good cinematography.Overall a good movie - just a bit long - but then again - some may have thought the fight scenes were needed."
9," Different but still very good
",aryangungun,/user/ur123679327/,4 February 2023,I watched it finally on Disnep+ Hotstar after such a long wait. My initial take was it would be more of a emotional movie but it turned out to be a little different.The difference was that it took on a adventurous turn. The whole Kukulkan thing was very interesting as a character and also his backstory was pretty good. The whole sea city that he had set up in 400years was worth seeing.More to that the story took a u-turn when he asked Shuri to partner up with her Wakandan force to defeat the world and obviously Shuri didn't do that.The conclusion of the movie was pretty decent and I will give a 8/10 so it. The adventurous part was 10/10 and the thing making Iron Man suit was cringe 5/10 for it.
2," Eye rolling plot holes
",jppchcqzd,/user/ur153218030/,4 February 2023,"I really wanted this movie to be good. I loved the original Black Panther. However, this movie is so overdone and full of plot holes that it becomes hard to watch.More than once, I found myself rolling my eyes at a sequence or audibly, talking back to the screen, because of a gaping plot hole.This could have been so much more, but just fall short everywhere. The only saving grace of the movie is Angela Bassett. Every scene she is in is powerful.Kids will enjoy it. Anyone over the age of 16 is going to find it something to put on in the background, and not really pay attention to. If you pay attention to this movie, too much, basically, if you keep your eyes open during this movie, you will find things that ruin the experience."

Almost every scene is so dark as to be unviewable. I walked out halfway thru the cinema release, tried again at home via Netflix and no different. A waste of time quite frankly. Story also seems a bit all over the place (what I could make out of it). I know the fight scenes were ok, but that doesnt justify a seven star rating. Cleearly lots of staff and actors on the movie got to voting. Not unusual nowadays, but this one is over the top. Its Marvel once again trying to cash-in with a second rate product."

I am simply amazed at the perfection of this film, without a doubt worthy of an Oscar!I believe that the only thing that left me wanting was the costumes, I thought it was ugly, but that is a matter of opinion, and it certainly does not interfere with the film.The special effects are good, at times it leaves something to be desired, but nothing that hinders your experience.I recommend you see it, you won't regret it!(Apologies for grammatical errors)"
4," Marvel Still Profiting From Chad Bozeman
",dmc101,/user/ur3030422/,4 February 2023,"This movie was a money grab disguised as a dedication to Chadwick Bozeman, who's untimely passing generated a huge emotional support wave for Marvel. Marvel has now capitalized on it while at the same time writing him off by introducing the exact same character, but a younger version. Of course MCU could not kill the franchise forever by having Bozeman as the last and final Black Panther, and yes they pretended to offer a tribute to him, but it came off as cheap and shady. I felt dirty when they were all mourning the death of the character when IRL the actor had died.I cannot speak for people who knew Chad personally, their mourning is their own, but this cheap, hollow money grab felt like what it was and the few seemingly geniune moments had zero to do with T'Challa and everything to do with Bozeman."

Lame. Writing is getting soft. The Beyonder is coming in the Secret Wars, phase 5 they say, and he is unstoppable. Waiting on how they will implement the XMen and Deadpool. Same time this was better than what DC put out. As we know, we all want a good movie. Blade is coming out. Will it be good? Will it make sense? If they ever make the Black Knight i will be besides myself. Same time, if they really want to make money, go and make Lady Death. My bad, that's not yours."
6," Scrawny Panther
",terrylarosa,/user/ur113058436/,4 February 2023,Just saw it for the second time and enjoyed it more since I knew about the boring parts of which there were quite a few. My main problem is having an actress physically ill suited to the role. Don't care if she's eaten the herbs or wears the powered suit she looks anorexic to the point of looking skeletal. That's not an appealing look for a superhero. The movie is too long and has little action though the three action set pieces are well done and the director uses slow motion to great effects. The movie's main strength is its villain Namor ( though I know they changed his origin completely ). The actor did a good job and the origin presented here was unique and interesting. As always the special effects are top notch. Marvel has done a great job with its casting and getting the actors physically fit for their roles but here with the main protagonist they failed miserably and I have to say the Wakandan's forever superior attitudes were so annoying that I was half rooting for the Talokans. Definitely one of Marvel inferior efforts.
7," Realism
",lrynroot,/user/ur159127955/,4 February 2023,"This movie is a great movie, to realism to a well known cast. I can easily put everyone to another person in a different movie. Also the animation is actually very good to the point where I couldn't even discern what was fake and what was not. It's not just a good movie, but the movie is actually really good at showing emotion, but no color. To be honest, what that means is not much filters are put it to make me feel what the movie feels. In the beginning of the movie it is also very dark so if I were to watch it not in tons of light, watch it with very dim light. With a good story I love this movie. It's not just very well acting. But also actually shows other movie hidden egs."

You conquer an enemy, kill the leader and then ask them to be an ally? Really??? People actually make money from writing this junk?Letitia Wright's acting is so horrible as a supporting role let alone leading one. I guess they didn't have a choice but she could've took some acting lessons. Just talking quietly doesn't make a mourning sister. But acting everywhere was bad. Worse than Star Wars prequels. Yes, that bad.All attempts at humor failed miserably. All emotional scenes were outright boring. Action scenes were ridiculous. I'm so glad I didn't pay to see it in theater."

",therealjaysmoke,/user/ur66492393/,4 February 2023,"Apart from Angela Bassett's Stella performance and that opening tribute to the late Chadwick, everything here was a total embarrassment to say the least. Nothing like the first Black Panther and my goodness, the acting was awful. I love Shuri but I think they will have to really do alot more to get Letitia to fill the shoes that Chadwick left. Maybe they realize she can't hence why they brought in Prince T'Challa at the end. Maybe in BP3 will see a new male character take up the role of BP cause I strongly don't think Shuri can hold this down.And can we talk about that joke of an antagonist, Namor, and his laughable underwater Kingdom? You'd think that after DC gave us that amazing underwater experience in Aquaman, Marvel would realize that they have to step it up but they didn't. Instead they gave us a farm in the ocean?! Haha with a king who has tiny wings on his ankles and can't breathe outside the sea unless he constantly keeps himself hydrated. Like seriously?This certainly is one of Marvel's worst but like I said, it will only pass simply in honor of Chadwick. And what were those Power Rangers like costumes worn by Okoye and the likes?

This is a 6.5 at best without the end credits scene. That put it up to a 7. Let's be honest, other than Spideman No Way Home, Marvel has been a massive dumpster fire since End Game. I can appreciate some of the special effects in this movie, but some of the story line is just way too silly. The villain, as an example, has flapping wings on his ankles??? Come on man......seriously? Someone needs to be fired over that stupid detail. A lot of Disney movies are overplaying to that Disney youth viewer and that's ruining the true potential of these movies. Let's get back to a serious Marvel movie. I'm so glad I didn't pay to see this flick. I would have felt like it was not money well spent. It's passable, but no where close to being one of the better Marvel movies. If you are a fringe Marvel fan, I'd recommend you pass on this and spend your time elsewhere. The people that super love this movie tend to be super Marvel fans that blindly think all Marvel movies are amazing. They just don't have the clarity in their brains to see what's in front of them."

Some CGI was good and others were less than impressive. The red suit of armor looked more like a power rangers episode than Marvel. The storyline as a whole lost it's origins and while I felt there was passion and heart in the first movie, this get hollow. It was not a bad movie, but I wish it was about 45 mins shorter.I can't actually pick one memorable dialogue moment from the movie, and I can't even begging to describe how idiotic the ending was.Also, I love the end where Namor described Black Panther as the most powerful of the land people... lol.

It is so slow about getting to any point whatsoever. Second, the storyline is an absolute mess. The writers could have done so much better in coMing up with a plot that actually worked. However, this story was all over the place trying to make a point and the point is that it missed. Thirdly, the acting was atrocious. It was either over the top which led to not being believable or under played which got lost in the messy writing. Best part of movie was Namor and yet his role could have been much better. Simply a poor movie with poor writing and acting."

It's like watching Bollywood movies, where the laws of physics do not exist in the world. There is almost no logic to the film at all.The villain in the film is a poorly written character, so as not to take up much time in the film, he was made absolutely according to the pattern of villains. He lives in a ""super advanced primitive civilization"", knows about Wakanda, but of course they don't even have TV...
There are a lot of deaths in the film, but you don't sympathize with anyone at all because of the bad acting and the stupidity and inhuman behavior of people.The fights in the film are quite a shame and cannot withstand any criticism."
7," A worthy sequel - RIP Chadwick Boseman
",Hammer-Rocks,/user/ur34458574/,4 February 2023,"With the passing of Chadwick Boseman, I was always going to be curious how they will evolve the Black Panther character in the series. And I'm happy to say it was done in a tasteful and respectful way.In my view, this is a worthy sequel to the uber successful first Blank Panther movie. There are new unique elements shown here to keep you interested including introucing never seen and known before adversary that are equally as powerful to keep the Wakandans in check. I'm glad they didn't resort to more alien invaders in this area.As expected, the special effects is first class, and cinematography impressive. But I think some elements where included just for the purpose of putting something different in. I'm refering to the Wakandan ship. Its design had no practical elements to it considering what is was used for. What makes movies like this believable is if every aspect of their design made sense, if they were real in the real world. Having said that, this movie delivered in CGI delight.There is plenty of action to be had, but far too many moments of slow burn. Puttimg an unecessary pause to the increasing fast pace the movie has built up.VERDICT: If you like super-hero movies and/or you liked the first Black Panther movie, then you'll enjoy this. It's more of the same but different."
6," Pretty good
",No-Life-101,/user/ur89954842/,3 February 2023,"I finally got around to watching the movie, which was pretty good. The beginning moments of the film were heartbreaking to watch, but we got to see how it would affect the characters throughout the movie. I don't actively read the comics so the ""villain"" of the story was shocking for me, the character was interesting but I didn't feel too interested. However, after some time and more of the storyline had been revealed it did get exciting but it took some time to get there (almost the 2-hour mark). Also, the ending was heartwarming and we got to see the main character Shuri get the closure that they were looking for, we got to see her journey on how she had to rediscover herself and work towards her goals. Unfortunately, there was no post-credit scene but I am looking forward to another Black Panther movie.Other details that I should mention: Very good action scenes (I'm not a professional) but they did look realistic and I like how they changed throughout the film. I really liked the characters and their development/growth was nice to watch, I especially loved the mother-daughter relationship because it didn't follow the ""typical"" media portrayal as toxic or tense but as a fun duo who look out for one another. Additionally, I loved the music and different portrayals of the diverse cultures, it shows that the universe in the movie is bigger than just the main characters. However, I did see an overuse of some special effects and once I noticed it was hard to look away. Also, I expected the ending, as soon as I saw the character I knew what was happening I personally don't like those storylines because I feel like it starts a cycle. But, overall it was a good movie and I'm happy that I finally got around to watching it."
4," Boring, too long, strange plot and no direction.
",andydjferguson,/user/ur49321007/,3 February 2023,"I'm not sure how some people can mark this down as a rating of 7/10 or above film. I'm not sure if the death of chadwick boseman threw a spanner in the works in terms of the storyline or what the direction the film should have went, but what we got left with was a very boring film which was too long and lacked substance.The first wakanda film wasn't upto much and this is worse. The script didn't really make sense for a lot of it and it felt like some parts were forced because of lack of ideas. Disappointing doesn't come close to describing it. It feels like marvel are trying to spout out too many films too quickly and it's showing in the quality in far too many films and series now."

Feels like the work of an overmotivated young cook who cannot decide what he should serve and puts all ingredients - and lots of it - into one dish.It's too much in the end, nothing feels right, nothing comes naturally, everything feels forced and wanted and directly out of of a screenwriting brainstorming session under the headline: ""what else could we do, what else could we pack into it?""You can actually hear them ask:
Do we have big and loud a action?Do we have fun and jokes?Do we have big feelings and emotions?Do we have a message for the kids?Do we have a message for the world?Do we have a surprise?Do we have the ethnic diversity right?Do we have a homosexual element?But the one person who has a vision and a real story was definitely not in those meetings.In the end: big style waste of money, thoroughly empty movie and sometimes dialogues that are so bad they make you cringe. It's like pizza with burger and popcorn and cheesecake and some Italian Antipasti put into a mixer.Skip at all (if you are busy) or watch for free (if you have time to spend) with loads of cheap beer and popcorn."

Fight scenes are non existing... I mean wtf.... This is super hero SF movie and not super lame drama.

2," Have I missed something?
",austingareth46,/user/ur27416456/,3 February 2023,"So let me start by saying I like marvel films, I liked the first black panther but didn't feel it was as good a film as credit was given. Some great characters like killmonger but not a patch on Thor Ragnarok so I can't say I was desperate for this one. Regardless of that I was keen to see this after the initial reviews but having now sat through it I honestly can't find anything about the film which makes it half decent. It's a whole lot of nothing story based around tributes (which I have no problem with) and poor matrix style slow motion action sequences which are over done and board line cheap. The film falls into the recent trend of being a whole lot of film about nothing, I'm personally calling this phase the Snap! Hoping for more with Ant-man as Marvel has started to become the emperors clothes."

",cedric_mg,/user/ur123583024/,3 February 2023,"I love the first Black Panther Movie, from Characters to the Plot and the Music, everything fit perfectly together. The actors Performances were also amazing and there was constantly something at stake.This Movie is the opposite, a bad plot, even worse dialogue and unfitting Music and atmosphere troughout. Ist even started Off decently, I was intrigued how the different Nations were trying to rob Wakanda of its Vibranium to gain an upper hand. Instead of focusing on such scenarios, the Marvel writers make up an entire people living at the bottom of the ocean? Just a disappointing mess that I doubt anyone who isnt a Marvel Fanboy is going to enjoy."

So very, very boring. It feels like some amateur student show at a fringe theatre. Given the talent and budget - awful. What a waste of such talent.The plot line is all over the place. You have no idea what is happening and then when you do you don't care. The critics say this is Disney being greedy - but I would argue if they were they were being greedy, they would have put some effort in to it. This is so dull and so boring - but crucially - a waste of talent. Amazing actors being made to make this rubbish into gold. Why betray actors like this with dross like this? Shame on the makers."
5," Boring
",Bigg_Bad,/user/ur1262249/,3 February 2023,"Can't point to any thing specific, the entire movie just seemed kind of flat and meh and literally nothing envoked any emotional connection for me. T'challas fathers death in Civil War was for me waaaaaay more impactful than anything in this entire movie, eventhough he had very little screen time in that movie.Iron Hearth could just as well have been left out of the movie, as she has almost no development or character...and the suit is horrible.Most of the other characters, I can't say much about as I just didn't care about them. Except M'baku which is still great.Shuri was fine...I guess."
7," what's happening to Marvel!
",mathewmartin-42537,/user/ur109975178/,3 February 2023,"Im on the fence about this film, on one hand its a good fun film, but as part of the MCU its a weird mess! I think they did a great and tasteful job of passing on Chadwick Boseman the person but kept his memory alive and allowing the story of the Black Panther to move onto the next person and really pleased it was Shuri, the problem is people dont see this as a film but more as PC correctness, i was even called a racist for saying it was not a good part of the MCU..got to love the snowflake generation.But ever since Endgame and No Way Home, Marvels quality of movies is going down hill (they should shelve Love and Thunder with the Eternals) and lets not forget the rubbish Sony have been making just to try and ride the coat tails, i have my fingers crossed for the next Antman and Guardians lol.The story of a new unknow race of underwater people have a problem with Wakanda because one machine found Vibranium in the ocean that didn't seem to be anywhere near them, does anyone else not see the problem with this story?? And how come they didn't have an issue when Thanos ""snapped"" where I'm sure some of them will have vanished, it was as simple as staying hidden as no one knew they existed, and take the word of Shuri for keeping their secret, look how long Wakanda stayed hidden, this film is basically just a prequel for Iron heart as they did a great job introducing Dominique Thorne's Riri character ahead of the series.The list can go one but as I started saying, I'm on the fence, take the movie out of the the timeline and just enjoy it as a fun film, dont over think it to much, i hope to see more of Shuri as the Black Panther in the future.I am lost about the mid credit scene... T'challa had a son, who was to old to be recent and as Black Panther got ""snapped"" then he must have been born before that except him mum was saving other people around the world and hadn't seen T'challa in a while... so just where did this kid come from.... very poor continuity, and yes I was overthinking."
1," Very bad!!
",dealbacastro,/user/ur9353797/,3 February 2023,"They have a fake Iron man, they have no originality, it is so much so that they recreate scenes from other Iron Man movies, Avengers 1, Black Panther 1, etc..., they wanted to give Shuri and already turned into a black panther, strength, power in his words but I think It was too big for the actress, then it was noticed that they wanted to give her more character, with the astonished reactions of the people with whom she spoke, it was very false and little acted, for example the scene black panther talks with M'Baku to force him to help him fight Namor, another bad scene was when Okoye goes looking for Aneka at her house to convince her to fight Namor, the part that stands firm Aneka, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry because of how bad it was was the sceneTo be sensible, the performance of Angela Bassett (Ramonda) was not very convincing, that movement of the lips that she has when she talks, she looks very arrogant, even in the sad scenes she looks very bad, I don't think she wins the credit Oscar.The fight scenes were very marked, the realism was not noticed in them.I must also say that the only scene that I liked was the last one where Shuri is remembering her brother at the campfire, very excellent as well as the post credit scene."
6," Average and diappointing
",kristiankollerud,/user/ur91076562/,3 February 2023,"If you like Marvel movies, you probably are going to enjoy this one.However I did not. Very predicatble movie, and it all felt very chaotic. There are storylines and characters that really just makes no sense to have in there.1. The point of having the Americans in there were?2. The young girls scientist with ""sass"" was just irritating.3. Wakanda seems super week in the movie. Where are all their warriors? I'm like face palming all the time in this movie.What was the point? It all felt pointless, and Wakanda as a nation just felt like it was run by morons.

8," Much deeper and all the better for it
",milyrouge,/user/ur20701922/,3 February 2023,"I'm a sucker for Marvel films. Sometimes, one needs to be able to just sit back and enjoy films, and that's what I find myself doing with a lot of Marvel films, including the first Black Panther film. Wakanda Forever is different. It's slower paced, has much fewer action scenes, less comedy, and more of a focus on the emotions of the characters. I think that for some, these differences will turn them off, but I absolutely loved it. I was captivated from start to finish and loved the greater depth and the character evolution.Recent Marvel films have been a bit of a mixed bag, some still really great, but several lacking the spark that made earlier films so good. If Wakanda Forever is any indication of how MCU films might evolve, then I'm hopeful."
7," some turmoil and new intros
",SnoopyStyle,/user/ur2898520/,3 February 2023,"The King is dead. Wakanda is struggling after the unexpected death of King T'Challa. Ramonda (Angela Bassett) takes over as Queen. It's a year later. The outside world is demanding that Wakanda shares its technology and vibranium. Unbeknownst to them, the CIA led by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) has found vibranium buried under the sea. The CIA crew is massacred by Namor (Tenoch Huerta) and his people although Wakanda is blamed. Namor is demanding the death of the inventor of the vibranium detector and that Wakanda join him in a war against the surface.The real world death of Chadwick Boseman has thrown this part of the MCU into turmoil. This movie relies heavily on the acting power of veteran Angela Bassett and she gets an Oscar nomination. Arguably, she leads the movie for the first half despite not being on the action mission. The other big aspects of this movie are the passing of the torch and the introduction of Namor. I am not that enamored with the torch passing. It needs to be done, but it could be better. Quite frankly, I'm not sold on the who. Like so many things, time will tell. Finally, Namor gets introduced into the MCU. He is probably one of the bigger Marvel character to not get something so far. I like his story and his history. Again, time will tell, but this has good potential. After Boseman's death, this will always going to be a memorial service and a patchwork story. Both are done well enough and Angela Bassett really shoulders the load."
5," Slow burner.
",navreview,/user/ur120266867/,3 February 2023,"When the trailer was out it looked very promising - a good movie coming out from Marvel studios after the disappointments from Moon knight, Shang Chi, Eternals and Ms. Marvel but in the end it was another disappointment. Yes it was an emotional tribute to the Chadwick Bosman the original black panther, but could have been way- way better. It is slow and lengthy with lack of depth in the story and at some point you feel sleepy. Well you do get some surprises in form of Michael B Jordan but it in the end you get another average movie in the fourth phase probably the worst of phase in the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe""."
1," It's just boring
",tomconder-849-407748,/user/ur48221061/,3 February 2023,Unfortunately it's just really long and boring. Fast and furious did a far more moving tribute to Paul Walker than this film does to Chadwick Boseman. Other than the few clips of him at the end I found myself constantly wanting this movie to get going which it just never did. A shame as I was eagerly anticipating this. Marvel have just lost their way. Maybe the writers should have taken a longer break after Boseman passed away and tried to write a film to entertain and then factored in a tribute to him. Whilst I appreciate using an actor speaking his native language I found it pretty hard to understand the male lead when he spoke English. A bit like a Spanish Bain!
1," 2.68
",ddaqqvas,/user/ur141132733/,3 February 2023,"Not a star rating, 2.68 is the number of hours of my life I will never recover.This was an absolute waste of time and money, both on the production of the film and the time and money I personally spent upon watching it.It was a 2 hour and 41 minute promotion of agenda, a 2 hour, 41 minute coda created and capitalized upon the death of Chadwick Boseman, a 2 hour, 41 minute introduction of the unknown son of T'Challa.This is shameful opportunism at its worst. The death of Chadwick Boseman was tragic and I applauded the MCU's decision that T'Challa would not be recast, but I'd have rather seen THAT than this schlock.Personally, I hope the House Of Mouse loses every attempt at keeping ol' Mickey from becoming public domain. Call it poetic justice. Disney is the Hydra of modern cinema. Where's Hercules when you need him?"
4," Really wanted to like this
",kopime,/user/ur75859637/,3 February 2023,"So being an Iron Man fanatic, naturally I was excited for Riri Williams AKA Iron Heart, first motion picture debut.Having read most of 'The Champions' comics I had a slightly different physical expectation of Riri. That being MUCH taller, and having longer curly/wavy hair. Beyond that, the constant reference of her being the 'scientist' also doesn't feel right. I mean Riri is an engineer and intellectual, not a scientist! Who calls a college student a 'scientist' anyhow?!?!?!?I'll also mention that the CGI in 'Wakanda Forever' looks more like SyFy channel style. Some of it looks great but overall it looked like people floating in air, not in water. I can only assume they had multiple studios working on different parts, which is why some looks awesome and other scenes look VERY low budget.An honorable mention to Winston Duke's M'Baku. IMHO he was the star of the film. He had the best lines and stage presence."
5," Very disappointing to see the direction they went with
",mheuerma,/user/ur96096124/,3 February 2023,"For some reason they decided to shift Black Panther to SOLELY a female ONLY movie? It's just weird because it's all you can think about thru the whole movie, where are all the dudes & warriors etc from the OG movie (Boseman aside)? Idk I just feel like they went in a direction no one was asking for and very little people were entertained by. There's legit 1 dude casted in the entire movie lol makes zero biological sense. Also, they get into this great big battle that the whole movie leads up to, all their people vs all the bad guys, and then after we win the 1v1 our leader vs theirs, we just help him up and then fly back to the battle together like long lost best friends??? WHILE all of our warriors are still battling theirs? They'd all look at the two leaders coming back on some floating saucer and be like wtf did we just fight to the death for just to go have brunch afterwards and talk about the weather forecast. In the OG Black Panther, if you challenged the entirety of Wakanda and all its people, you met your fate of death or incarceration; this time we just gave them a hug & kiss and said don't do it again? Lmao could have been soooooo much better, sucks they failed to keep the audiences opinion in mind when making the movie."
6," It's not bad but it's not great.
",vithiet,/user/ur96996693/,3 February 2023,"Like many people I have conflicting feelings about this movie. I appreciate how difficult it was to make a sequel without Chadwick Boseman and in that regard they did an excellent job. The various ways they gave homage throughout the movie were tasteful and heartfelt. Action sequences and CGI are Marvel-level polish we are used to, although the ultra slick transformer style suits make me yearn for early Iron Man movies ""raw"" look and feel. I don't know how I feel about replacing Atlantis with Talokan as I welcome diversity on the one hand but on the other I'm a bit sad as a long time Marvel comics purist. My biggest issue though is with the uneven acting, with fantastic Angela Basset, sub par Letitia Wright, and everything in between. I'll still watch all Marvel movies but they're definitely on a declining trend in quality at this point."

Lame action scenes and dialoguea nd very predictable plot. I'm glad that I just downloaded the movie instead of wasting money in the theater. Marvel movies are dying in qualities, I like this don't have generic comedy that you will always see in almost every Marvel movies. This can be a decent film if it's not that long cut useless dialogue. The only decent are costume designs.This should be the end of this franchise, it will be going downhill. Marvel should stop pushing this film and find new characters to produce."
7," MCU Phase 4 and T'Challa get neat closure! [+69%]
",arungeorge13,/user/ur30872044/,3 February 2023,"The MCU Phase 4 fatigue has definitely sunk in, and gone are the days of one or two tentpole entries per year. For someone who has seen every film in the MCU until Endgame, I've grown dispassionate about having to keep up with too many spin-off TV shows and such and such. I did watch most of the films from Phase 4 (barring Eternals) but I was quick to notice that you had to be aware of events from some of the shows to fully comprehend certain plot points. However, the enchanting world of Wakanda wasn't one you could see in any other films, and that somehow made it distinct. Also, the passing of everyone's favourite Chadwick Boseman made me want to know how director Ryan Coogler would move the Wakandans' story forward.Wakanda is still beautiful as ever, but it takes its own sweet time to acknowledge the sorrow and loss from T'Challa's death. It's a recurring theme throughout the film; one that solidifies the decisions taken by Shuri (who's the new Black Panther). It also helps that the key characters we loved from the first film are all given their moments to shine, be it in set-pieces or on the emotional front. The antagonist's entry was powerful but his backstory lacked depth. Danai Gurira (Okoye), Lupita Nyong'o (Nakia), and Angela Bassett (Ramonda) occupy screenspace for all the right reasons.I'm a bit divided on Shuri's sudden ascent to becoming the next Black Panther (even the suit agrees?). The whole scenario plays out too quickly for us to get too excited about it. I didn't care much for the entire episode in the US, or the random addition of Riri Williams / Ironheart. Also, it'd be difficult to look past the resemblances between Avatar 2's Metkayina clan and the Talokan army portrayed in this film, especially given the aquatic setting and the release dates of both. The set-pieces are impressively crafted, and even though they're limited in number, they make you sit up each time. The mid-credits scene is a sweet little tribute, and it succeeds in working our tear glands. Ludwig Göransson's score is pitch-perfect!"
1," Long and boring
",middlehitter-92234,/user/ur70202300/,3 February 2023,"In all the reviews, no one is addressing the appropriation of so many cultures so badly. In both Black Panther movies I felt that the Wakandan culture was nonsense. With so many technical advancements in medicine, electronics, energy and engineering it is illogical that they would mix 19th century African, ancient Incan and Mayan with numerous North American tribal garb, adornments and weapons into this advanced society.And All the hand to hand, knife and spear fighting felt like an excuse for gymnastic cgi that was exposed as utter nonsense whenever a laser, sonic or percussion weapon was employed. And every warrior comes equipped with outlandish power and strength that is ineffective because they are also all apparently unaffected by being thrown hundreds of feet at speeds that destroy every surface that run into but leave them without a scratch much less serious injury.As for the screenplay, what a fiasco. The funeral for Chadwick at the beginning was overwhelmed by spectacle while feeling flat because none of his many Marvel super friends attended. Then the Queen's funeral had almost no attendees. Weird.The Black Panther doesn't appear until the final battle which was basically a weird sonic trap on what appeared to be about 40 people that turned into a naval assault on a single ship. Between both armies I estimated about 200 people fighting. And all hand to hand with wooden spears and battle axes.I couldn't feel anything for the characters that either spouted cliche after cliche or bellowed grandiose pronouncements in contrived scenery chewing rampages standing in for actual emotion.Scene after scene of women in tribal garb given free reign to spout empty threats while the muggles sat motionless having been giving no direction in the script.Finally, the main conflict was that another supposedly advanced race was driven into the sea by ingesting the same stuff that empowers the black panther but they turn blue in a second, grow gills and swim like great sharks. The main guy somehow flies so efficiently with tiny winged feet that he anticipates both bullets, bombs and lasers but can be beaten down with a stick. His achilles heal is that he needs to get wet every few hours.Glad I watched this on Disney because I was so bored that I solved a few advanced sudoku puzzles while this Marvel drivel played in the background and I never missed a single thing. This is indicative of just how bad Marvel has become. There are truly no new worlds to conquer and the writers are stuck regurgitating the same stories better told as 1870 US westerns than scifi cgi crap.BTW, I agree that the westerns I used to love are filled with stereotypical white saviors and brown skinned magical natives. But how is Wakanda any better? Its still using the same tropes but it's okay because the none of the cast (but one) is a white guy?"
5," A fitting finale for a tragic loss. Just, not a great movie,
",tlk914,/user/ur9299916/,3 February 2023,"I suppose you cant blame anyone. Chadwick Boseman dying was not something you could write away in any sort of manner and have the audience that respected and loved the character he brought brilliantly to life not feel cheated. Boseman brought charisma, presence, athleticism, and style to spare. He commanded every scene in all his appearances in the Marvel universe. This movie lacked that presence and they simply couldnt restore that. Danai Gurira is always a pleasure to watch, as is Angela Basset and Lupita Nyongo. But this movie missed the presence of the Black Panther that was Chadwick Boseman, and the effort to elevate Letitia Wright from a character who was previously a wisecracking comic relief to the new lead hero just didnt really feel like it worked? The Villain was poorly presented, the explanation felt cobbled and rushed. So much about it felt like they were trying to replace story with style, substance with simplification. They couldnt deal with the loss of Chadwick Boseman, so they sidestepped the problem via overemphasis till the audience wanted to move past it. And not a single appearance by an Avenger at the funeral seemed like a gaping hole?They had a mountain of issues to try and write away and overcome. And perhaps they did as well as any could. But perhaps no movie could have every fixed this? Sometimes, you do your best, and you live with what you can. Well done, Im glad I watched it once. As much to see how we move past Prince T'Challa and on to the future, and fittingly say our final goodbyes.But I will not own the DVD, I will not scroll through the list of streaming movies and pull this one again. It simply wasnt as good as it needed or wanted to be.And its time to move on."

," Ryan Coogler's Weakest Directorial Effort To Date
",CinemaClown,/user/ur20018357/,3 February 2023,"The 30th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and also the concluding chapter of their Phase 4 slate, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever starts on a promising note with an emotional eulogy that exudes honesty & earnestness but when it comes to its own standalone story, there are lot more downs than ups in this bloated, uninvolving mess when compared to its celebrated predecessor.Co-written & directed by Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station & Creed), the first act of this sequel is where it's at its strongest and the film also does well to make the new antagonist's motivations understandable. However, the plot is thinly spread out over its tedious runtime instead of being consolidated into a tighter narrative and is also undermined by its bland execution, uninspiring action & dry effects.There is hardly any sense of awe & wonder evident in its spectacle, the underwater kingdom is surprisingly unappealing, and even the action scenes are terribly choreographed. The film was doing better when addressing Wakanda getting challenged by intervening world powers during its state of mourning. Still, the performances help keep things afloat and Angela Bassett steals the show with a commanding showcase.Overall, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is an inferior follow-up that also qualifies as Coogler's weakest directorial effort to date. The story begins with plenty of potential but it fizzles out as it trudges the 161 mins runtime with nothing new or exciting to offer. A mediocre entry in what has been a mediocre phase for Marvel Studios, their latest offering is another forgettable dud in the canon that impresses & entertains in only bits n pieces."

This movie was long and incredibly boring. The sound wasn't that great. A lot of it was dark and underwater. The actual movie doesn't start u till the 2 hour mark. I have no idea what they were thinking when they made this 3 hour long bore fest. Wanakand for never.
2," Boring, nonsensical and bad special effects
",oldguynewguy-1,/user/ur19478229/,3 February 2023,"One of the three worst MCU films: not as bad as The Eternals but probably worse than Thor: The Dark World (and that's saying something). The first ninety minutes are a snooze fest and then, once the action finally gets going an hour before the end, it's a mess with poor special effects and action sequences that are just plain weird. There is one briefly redeeming scene where an old villain makes a cameo appearance but then the audience's ears are assaulted with a synthesizer musical score straight out of the '80s. More snoozing then more awful effects and weird action until a ""climax"" that just sputters like a stalled car to the side of the road.On a slightly different note, Iron Man's replacement is as boring and bland as everything else in the movie. Namor's characterization, though not bad, is terribly miscast, missing the arrogance, disdain and imperialism that are hallmarks of the character in the comics. And the notion that the Black Panther could hold her own against an adversary that, by the show's own admission, may be as strong as the Hulk is laughable. I really can't even imagine what the writers and director were thinking."
6," , Wakanda he's definitely missing Chadwick
",geary-72417,/user/ur79028888/,3 February 2023,"This movie is very underwhelming. The beginning isn't that bad, but they really need to get something in the middle, because the storyline just kind of fell through. The characters are a little bit weak, and the introduction of the underworld people doesn't make any sense whatsoever.It doesn't make much sense that no one's ever heard of these people living under the water for the last thousand years.On a lighter note, so they did a nice tribute to Chadwick in the beginning, which makes the movie somewhat watchable. But there is a giant hole with him not in it. Not sure if this movie needed to be made or not.I'll give it a six out of respect for Chadwick."
4," Without a doubt the 2nd worst Marvel movie
",chooper-32740,/user/ur74197730/,3 February 2023,"Only internals was worse .... And it's close. Who wrote this dialogue? Cliche and predictable. Zero action till the final 20 mins. The acting was also subpar, but you can't blame them with a storyline like this and with this script. Are we not vetting screenplays/scripts with normal people any longer? Or just with ""yes people"" that have no real opinion?It's movies like these that make me glad I didn't pay theatre prices to see it. Watch it if you want to be semi-entertained but please don't expect I high quality movie like the first Black Panther.Please, please let Ant Man be better.Thanks."
1," Bunch of fake reviews and ratings to give this movie more than a 6.0
",tranat71,/user/ur52653643/,3 February 2023,"Whoever wrote and did this movie should not be allowed to make another movie.Black Panther 2 is pure crap from beginning to end to end. Even the ending after the credits was pure crap. Goodness gracious.Boring beyond belief. No focus whatsoever. They basically made this movie just to say (again) that it was another ""breakthrough"" because it was mostly all Black and Hispanic American actors. Give it a rest already.They tried to make this movie all ""serious"" by showing us 2 unnecessary boring pointless funerals that were supposed to be sad and heartbreaking, but they were just stupid.Terrible plot, terrible writing. Just terrible.To be fair, this movie isn't the worst movie. Wonder Woman 2 is much worse than this movie. But this movie should not be rated more than a 6.0."
4," So Chadwick passes and this is what is left?
",Fargomoviecritic,/user/ur112326512/,2 February 2023,"Who was the acting coach and director of this horrible attempt of a Marvel movie? RiRiis an immature actor who should be starring in an immature comedy show on Disney plus. What a shame of the over acting and weak storylines. Angela Basset was good, but how did the people of Namor infiltrate through water? They attacked and got through the most technology advanced city of Wakanda? How? No way.He also uses his water grenades to break through glass that a vibranium spear can't penetrate? Such weak holes in this movie.I did get chills when the princess reveals herself as the Black Panther to her people. - that was cool.This could have been a better movie - retakes of the bad acting, better CGI and a storyline that makes sense. Also the CIA to keep blaming the Wakandans when they know it was Namor, that is dumb too."
7," Wakanda Forever: a good movie from an MCU in decline
",JulesAndVincent6,/user/ur100822794/,2 February 2023,"This is a good movie, in general terms, although it is true that I find some elements that are redundant or not entirely necessary, leaving as a result a 161-minute superhero film that is entertaining at times, and boring at others.Perhaps the strongest point (besides the visual effects that abound in the genre) are its performances. Lupita Nyong'o, Angela Bassett and Tenoch Huerta shine in their roles and shine as brightly as their characters allow them to.Deserved each and every one of his Oscar nominations. But the level of this phase 4 of a universe that saw its peak in the infinity saga is really worrying."
2," Wakanda Ends Never!
",paisley-dan,/user/ur40831092/,2 February 2023,"After the original Black Panther and the appearances made by the character set in the rest of the MCU, maybe my expectations were too high. First it has to be said, Chadwick Boseman is obviously irreplaceable and his loss made it impossible for the rest of the cast to fill gap he left. That being said, why on earth it had to be so long is beyond me. That character development was atrocious and ultra boring. My girlfriend was legitimately sleeping 45 minutes into the film. Beginning to end you're left wondering when it is going to get better and it really never does. The battle scenes are a shadow of the first installation for choreography to cgi and everything in between. The story itself is not at all compelling. Suri is just not a lead character. The actress was really nice in a supporting role but she did not stand out in a positive way at all. Namor... ooooffff. Brutal representation of the comic character. Marbles on the guys mouth. Be ready to hit rewind to understand what the hell he's saying.The intro to what appears to be the iron man is disappointing as well. This director just copies a couple of things from iron man 1 to represent a « similar struggle » to Tony Stark I guess. This actress has been put in such a brutal situation to try and replace tony stark. She has zero chance of being well received in this role.As a lifelong marvel fan, I was so impressed with virtually everything through Phase 4. After this I think it's safe to say, expectations need to be lowered across the board. This was just disappointing, it was an outright terrible movie that was incredibly difficult to stay awake through."
4," Worst than the first one
",korp-73712,/user/ur73306683/,2 February 2023,"Make me laugh at the serious parts, made me cringe at the comedy bits and made me bored at the action scenes.Iron heart brought nothing to the movie other that promote her mini series.The script was a joke to the point that no matter how much the actors tried to save it, it was a lost cause. Some of the characters decisions made no sense and the final battel is plane stupid.The music was out of place at some scenes.The CGI was lacking sometimes but overall was the best part of this movie.The MCU keeps falling down in a spiral of mediocracy. At this point, they need to stop and look back in the past to see what make this movies great and bring back that flame."
2," Two hours forty-eight minutes of MEH
",jmhaas-265-699366,/user/ur30546687/,2 February 2023,"Special effects were great, but the plot and ideas were not believable and mostly laughable. The hero gets run through with a long spear and is in pain and moaning. Then she snaps off what is in front of her and slides her torso forward and off the two inch in diameter wooden shaft. No blood. Seconds later, she is fighting and moving around without even a hint of pain. The closing scenes provide the basis for the next movie. There is a challenger for Wakanda leadership by a big burly guy and there is confusion by a race of defeated oceanic people as to why they surrendered to the Wakandans in the first place. I will not be tricked into viewing the next one, if there is one."
2," wow , i really dont know if i should trust ratings now .
",mrpresident-king,/user/ur46297594/,2 February 2023,"After checking all the ratings , i went to see this movie , i am deeply disappointed ,I was wondering why this movie got so high rating then it hit me, it looks like it is backed by American politics ( i am not American). It has nothing to offer as art . One thing more i am not white person etc bla bla . But why we didn't include more white people that is out of my understandings, if we want racccism to disappear then we should try it as from our end, I will not say i didn't suffer or i am not suffering from it right now , but we should do what we are expecting from them. I love colourful movies . With story and little bit less fake drama .lately i start seeing the gap is getting very wide , and most of the time some movies are getting sympathetic positive reviews , which actually defeat the purpose of ratings ."
1," A Cultural Mix
",francomorelishere,/user/ur69888801/,2 February 2023,"The movie wants to be inclusive, diversive, cultured and progresive but this only makes the story lame, boring, and unheroic. The acting is poor and cliche. There is no main driver in the story and you do not know the purpose or the goal of the characters. The backstory and motives off the characters is shallow and it does not attract the attention of the viewer. There is no connection to previous movies or the marvel universe.The writers want to show the beauty of nature and of aborigean cultures like the mayans, but that is not achieved.Sadly, the Black Panther transition and succession es poor."
7," Superhero movies can also be like that
",saolivaresm,/user/ur132357199/,2 February 2023,"The dose is repeated again by Ryan Coogler with the second installment of Black Panther. The bet was risky after the unfortunate death of Chadwick Boseman, but the intelligence to close a chapter and open another by its director is a truly remarkable result, who says goodbye to our Black Panther in the most poetic and deserved way.After what was done, we fully entered into a proposal that continues with that commercial cinema that is supposed to be Marvel, but that does not lose the essence of a director who does not hesitate to put his own look at what he has to offer.It is a film that at all times processes to be serious maintaining the line of its predecessor, giving a tonality full of roots and culture to a film that gives us the most rooted superhero in the entire Marvel cinematographic universe.As I thought with its first installment, the seriousness with which the entire world of Wakanda and its culture is faced allows us to enter into a challenge as spectators, to feel qualified or not to receive more forceful proposals than a set of action sequences and jokes to release tension.That is the challenge that gives you to understand the true spectacle that turns out to be the world that Ryan Coogler proposes with his Black Panther. Proof of that is managing to give an actress the first Oscar nomination for playing a character in Marvel, as is the absolutely brutal performance of Angela Bassett who is pure feeling and emotions in her presence throughout her time on screen. That scene facing Okoye justifies understanding what is really behind Coogler's proposal.It is also valid to be able to connect or not with the proposal that they offer us, that is left to the judgment of each viewer and what they expect to receive when going to see Black Panther 2.In great detail it is a film that maintains the level of its first installment, which has an excess of footage for those who are looking for something different and more dynamic, it is really a film that if you do not connect from the beginning it is very difficult for you to process its duration in a positive way.It is also true that it falls into the same mistakes as several of the previous films, that of inconsequentially handling certain characters that end up being more connectors or triggers for conflicts rather than a real contribution to the story or to the film itself.Cases like the character of Martin Freeman or Julia Louis-Dreyfus that feel like just an ornament that could not be there or the most graphic case, the little connection that is achieved with Dominique Thorne and her role as Riri. On the contrary, we have the splendid use that is given to Namor and everything that corresponds to his culture and his actions that Tenoch Huerta interprets in a solid way, as well as the testimony that Letitia Wright receives as the new Black Panther, a background and a path by which he takes the character that makes it clear to us what his director is really looking for with all this.A film that generated diverse opinions, but that in its central nucleus once again gives it a little more blood and shows that superhero cinema can also be without as much spectacle as we are used to."
9," New promising chapter
",BeGerman,/user/ur16193351/,2 February 2023,"A wonderful story about loss and finding. About the destruction and lack of cultural empathy of friends. Tells you the strength and weaknesses of a woman. The inability to recognise alliances in the sense that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. No Marvel film I know of to date has dared to tell such a complex story, which is good for the series. The hope of an action overloaded film a la Avenger is not fulfilled here. With this film, a new promising chapter has been added to the MCU. Let's hope that the makers, like the moviegoers, have the courage to get involved, it would be worth it. Away from pure comic entertainment, towards more depth."
4," Disappointing
",Zeevik_26,/user/ur124013465/,2 February 2023,"You can tell where this fiasco of movie is going within 5 minutes of the post Chadwick Boseman tribute (decently made, the one redeeming aspect of the movie).Group of all-Caucasian (of course) mercenaries i.e. ""colonizers"" (term used frequently all over the movie by various non Caucasian characters) is brought before a UN session and are ordered to ""kneel"" before the Wakanda queen who is speaking, or, to be more precise, lecturing and then threatening the evil West representatives not to ""steal Wakanda resources"". Cut. You get the idea.Now can you imagine similar scenario where the opposite is portrayed ? Nope.And of course we have the smart non Caucasian girl inventing cutting age tech all by herself in a garbage garage ? Really ? Not to forgot (of course) her helping the lazy Caucasian student with his tech project.Villain is forgettable and nonsensical and so is all this close to 3 hours of bigotry and boredom."
1," Pure Garbage
",dodgersfan_32,/user/ur25124767/,2 February 2023,"This is by far the worst Marvel movie ever made! If I watched it in the theater, I would've walked out and asked for my money back. This was a disgrace to Chadwick Bozeman. Don't even know where to start. The storyline, the music, the acting. Just, unimaginable horrible. I hope they just stop this franchise or totally redo everything. Not much really to say but, apparently my review is way too short so I have to keep typing or they won't except it. Which is ridiculous because, all reviews don't have to be a short story written by a professional author. Regular people like myself should be able to have opinions as well."
4," Afro Futurism missing
",bobetjo,/user/ur8528669/,2 February 2023,"Wakanda Forever is such a mess that I gave up on it. There are some good actors really badly directed. Angela Bassett as the Queen carries herself regally but makes silly bad tempered decisions. Lupita N'Yongo is so watchable and yet is not allowed to show much character. The amazing Afro-Futurism of Black Panther is just coasted by. Barely shown. Yet, a quick look at the Tor website at the time, reveals a whole genre of scifi books released based on the audience appetite.But perhaps the worst aspects are the fast, dark fight scenes. Just a blur of superhero style clashes. Yawn. It felt so boring and flat."
5," The avenge-mate!
",yelrahrekoj,/user/ur130575849/,2 February 2023,"You forgot to include ""Black Panther's Avenge-mate'"" in his own burial scene. They fought a lot of battles together. Is it not necessary to have them in that scene? I know the movie is not the... ""Avengers"" but it felt unreasonable not to see them mourning for him. That's too bad!!! I like the movie, but it kind of felt sad that they didn't put in the effort to have those important people in that scene. Bash me if you want, but I really felt that something was wrong about it. Although I appreciate them going underwater this time, And aside from that part, everything turned out well! I wasn't expecting much, but it is good. We did miss Chadwick!"
7," A Powerful Impression
",BijeshNagesh,/user/ur94005246/,2 February 2023,"First Impressions:The movie contained plenty of sentimental value and the messages at the heart of the plot were as simple as they were profound. ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" proved to be a good balance of action and emotion.Story Analysis:With the passing of King T'Challa - rest in power, Chadwick Boseman - the kingdom of Wakanda was left vulnerable and open to exploitation and attack from external forces. Holding everything together was Queen Ramonda and the Dora Milaje warriors. But even they knew that a new Black Panther was the only way to restore order and dignity to the nation of Wakanda.Shuri reluctantly took up her brother's mantle and became the new Black Panther. However, her problems did not just pertain to the land, because a dangerous mutant threat was coming from the sea. His name was Namor and he had a very different opinion on the future of the surface world.This sequel hit all the right notes. It carried an aura of power and prestige. ""Wakanda Forever"" often felt different from the usual MCU fare. It contained gravitas and opened possibilities worth exploring in other Marvel movies to come.I especially loved everything they did with Namor - the Mayan K'uk'ulkan, aka Feathered Serpent God. He was not only dutifully replicated from the original comic books but also became the first (and most ancient) mutant to be introduced in the MCU. His calm charm and casually cruel intentions were riveting.Angela Bassett's performance as Queen Ramonda was yet another highlight of the movie. After witnessing what she did with the character in this production, I was convinced that she genuinely deserved the 2023 'Best Actress' Oscar nomination. It marked the first recognition of its kind for Marvel Studios.Vibranium was in special focus in ""Wakanda Forever"", particularly the danger of it falling into the wrong hands outside Wakanda. I liked how well they covered those portions, mainly because of the real-life nuclear parallels that continue to threaten our lives.The plot of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" had one foot in African heritage and another in tech-driven futurism. The movie contained a good bit of classic MCU elements, which enriched the plot and enhanced the performance value of every character who featured in it.Editing and sound effects were great. Musical scoring was exemplary. Hair-makeup and costume design were superb. Set decoration and art direction were remarkable. Stunts were amazing. VFX was notable. Screenplay was engaging. Direction was great.Final Notes:The movie also doubled as a tribute to the late-great Chadwick Boseman who left us recently. He previously played the Black Panther to outstanding effect before his time in this life came to a close.Shuri's strength and resilience in the face of overwhelming odds, Ramona's impassioned plea for support, and Namor's laser-focused determination to enforce his will ensured that ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" would leave a powerful and enduring impression in the hearts and minds of viewers. I personally experienced as much watching it via streaming.There were times when the movie felt as though it skipped a few scenes, but nothing so bad as to belittle the overall quality. The post-credits scene - which revealed the son of T'Challa - held great promise. And Namor, though alive, was playing the long game. It looks like the next ""Black Panther"" movie has plenty to work with."
6," A movie that works better in parts than in its entirety.
",MoviesWithX,/user/ur131966393/,2 February 2023,"I knew this movie was not going to be as enjoyable as the first given the loss of the late Chadwick Boseman. Every movie that he's not a part of from here on out will suffer because of his untimely death. However, this movie, despite being watchable, is not a movie that I think I would want to watch through its entire run time again. I didn't hate the movie, and I have good things to say about it, but it also falls into some of the exact same Marvel trappings that they've been stuck in for a while that have had me kind of jaded with them. First, I feel that everyone gave mostly great performances in this film. A lot of attention is obviously on Angela Bassett right now (who won a Golden Globe for her performance and has received her second Oscar nomination and is expected to win) and she's fantastic, but I feel that the main standout in this movie in my opinion when she wasn't on-screen was Danai Gurira as Okoye. I thought she had the best humor in the movie and I thought she had the best individual action scenes. Letitia Wright is very good as Shuri once again, and Winston Duke as M'Baku is great to see again. Lupita Nyong'o was also wonderful in her small doses. Tenoch Huerta was fine as Namor. I had no issue with him. While I'm still on the positives of things, I also thought that this movie once again had terrific production design, and I enjoyed a lot of the exterior shots. I don't know if they actually shot all of these shots on location when they were in different parts of the world (probably not) but those parts looked nice. Great costumes as well once again. And now, I'm going to get on to the things that I don't like so much. There are two characters in this movie that I don't think really needed to be in it: Riri Williams and even less so, whoever the character was that Julia Louis-Dreyfus played. I thought the actress that played Riri Williams did a fine job but her inclusion in this film was literally for nothing except to say ""Hey, welcome to the MCU"" because she's getting a Disney+ show sometime this year. It's just a vehicle for her. The Julia Louis-Dreyfus character was in ""Black Widow"" (didn't see it) from what I've heard and even with the few scenes she had here, I found her kind of annoying and not funny. She just felt like she was written into this movie just to crowd Martin Freeman's character, despite what her job is. In Martin Freeman's introductory scene, he's out running and he's swatting a bug out of his face or what he thinks is a bug. That's how I felt about JLD's character in this. Their inclusions overall is an issue I guess you could say is why I'm tired of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, because they won't just let the movie be contained enough to focus on what they're doing. They just have to remind you that ""Hey, this is someone else that Marvel made and you're going to see them again later. It's all connected."" I don't care. Focus on what you're doing right now. Namor as a villain is honestly kind of boring and Talokan does not look nearly as cool as Wakanda. You really don't even need the comparison. It just doesn't look all that great by itself to me. And also the music in my opinion by Ludwig Goransson was a disappointment this time around. There's hardly anything that I'd want to go back and listen to later. Also, I've become aware of how awful Marvel tends to treat their visual effects artists, and it's a real shame. And I mean that for their sakes, not the films. I don't endorse it whatsoever, but I'm simply talking about the work here as it is in the finished film. I feel like once you seen one big Marvel set piece, you've seen them all now. The scene when Namor is in Wakanda felt to me like I was watching any other Marvel movie, from a visual effects standpoint. It's like it's just automatically boring now to watch some of these scenes. And they for some reason in this movie incorporated the use of slow-mo a few times. No need for that. And the battle at the end has some of the same issues too, aforementioned and these to follow. Instead of showing one main scene go on, they have to cut back and forth between two other things going on at the same time. Granted, Marvel movies are not the first to do that, but I'm honestly getting really sick of this because I just feel like I can see it coming from a mile away now. Let me see what is happening. Also, the movie like a lot of movies these days isn't long because it knows what to do with the length, but rather it's just long just to be long. I don't have a problem with long movies as long as you use your runtime well. ""The Batman"" in my mind used its runtime well. But I wasn't really into this that much, especially when Shuri was in Talokan. There are good scenes in this, and I particularly like the ending of this movie as well as the mid-credits scene. But at the end of the day this movie to me is at its best, just good to decent moments instead of ""I can't wait to see this movie again"". Watching clips online or something is a better way of experiencing it. I'm not holding the passing of Chadwick Boseman against this movie and I knew I wasn't going to like this movie as much without him being a part of it, but also I'm not so sure about the direction they went in either. They should've recast him."
6," The same plot again.
",kealan-symes,/user/ur19714483/,2 February 2023,"The same basic plot as the first film. A challenger/antagonist appears, some dialogue between the two followed by all out war/destruction/death with the challenger eventually being defeated after which there is a rapprochement between the two parties.That's literally the entire plot of both movies. Simplified of course.There's more to the movie than that of course, some excellent fight choreography, eye-popping costumes and make up. Acting was decent and music very good, but it's hard to stay in the story when you see where it's going pretty early in.I'm giving it 6/10 for the other aspects, but you're making a sequel folks, not remaking the original."
10," Undoubtedly the best Marvel movie since 2019
",smir-12043,/user/ur161897995/,2 February 2023,"In this film, the director was able to fill the absence of the late Chadwick Boseman by placing Shorey in the role of Black Panther, and in general, characters such as Nimore and Shorey will play an important role in the future phases of this cinematic world, because each country and territory is isolated. And it is far from the reach of the world and this can promise a world war in Marvel.In my opinion, this movie showed that Marvel is still alive and we didn't see the mistakes of Thor, love and thunder in this movie; this movie is better than the other works of this phase and in terms of the director and the beautiful acting of the actors, it is one of the best Marvel movies.For the late Chadwick Boseman."

The story was nothing but either politics of a nation that chose to deprive an ever dying world of much needed resources and technology or revere it's self for having such thing's.Impossible to invest in the characters I just couldn't wait till it was over (I was with two ppl who love th MCU so I stayed.ðŸ¤·).Really disappointed! ðŸ‘Ž"

Powered by phenomenal performances of the cast from the Wakandan side, the tragic passing of Boseman was utilized to great potential, elevating the movie to end on a solemn and emotional high note, which stands out as a somewhat rare entry in the recent MCU."

At one point I needed a loo break so I paused the movie. When I came back, I noticed that I was clear through half of the movie.Thrift Store Aquaman was doing the whole 'Something Something Dark Side something something' speech and there had been zero Black Panther in the Black Panther movie.It's like putting on a Bob Ross show and watching him set his easel up for 75% of the run time and only seeing him paint something for the last 20 minutes.Theres setting the scene and theres setting the scene.. you can skip first 90 minutes and just read one sentence:Thrift store Aquaman is mad people know about MacGuffin and wants to kill the people that told the people about the MacGufffin."

I had fun. The fact that the ""villains"" and heroes came together at the end made it wholesome, because it kept the spirit of Chadwick's Panther alive. Movie Super 8 has higher rates than this movie, but it can't even hold water to this movie. So don't expect people to be real. People don't know what is a good movie. People see Hoakin's Joker and are acting like it's something special, when in reality this movie was 10 times better than Joker. People like what you tell them to like. This movie was great and I was on the verge of crying at the end. I'm so sad Chadwick died. He was a great dude. This movie did him justice. I'm giving it 10/10 for what it is. I don't know why people expect to watch a masterpiece, Oscar worth superhero movie. It's a simple superhero movie. Stop trippin. This movie is great."
9," The best marvel films since the Captain America trilogy
",MattTB87,/user/ur67992511/,2 February 2023,"So this is a tricky one for me, as a british white guy in his 30s, a lot of this movies major themes about cultural identity are wasted on me, that being said, It's by far the best marvel film of the last couple of years and at least on par with the Captain America trilogy (which would be my ""top"" marvel films).Characters aren't the strongest across the board with Riri Williams being a little on the annoying side however offsetting that against the personal growth of Shuri really puts the talent to work, transforming a formally ""brat"" character into a strong lead who has to deal with loss and grief while carrying a stellar cast is not as easy task but thankfully one that is pulled off here.Without spoilers, it's difficult to talk about the major plot points so we'll leave those well alone and just call it a 9/10 and say ""if you liked Black Panther"" and character driven story scifi then you'll probably like this!"
2," overrated bad acting
",ajikude,/user/ur86967531/,2 February 2023,"So overrated. Bad comical acting. Woody performances. The action scenes are laughable. The script is predictable with too many boring flat scenes. Even Eddy Murphy and Wesley stipes movies were better. I expected alot more. The fight action scenes are really bad. And why put Kamaru Usman in the movie?. So bad is his acting, I almost butst put laughing when he spoke. The CGI is mediocre. The motorbike scenes are really not realistic at all. I had to force myself to see the end of it. The fighting scenes in the bridge were so bad especially. Tedious to watch. Overall to much overacting and bad script."
3," Waste of time
",perovic96,/user/ur44530098/,2 February 2023,"The only good thing about this movie is a tribute to the fallen actor.After that we have over 2 hours of M-She-U fighting Mister Nimbus from rick and morty over absolutely nothing, with result that puts everything back at status quo.It's clearly just a movie designed to push more politics down the viewers throats disregarding the purpose of the movie , to be entertaining.In this episode of M-She-U we got Black Panther and Ironman roles switched to the female counterparts.We also got a standard ""we're from Africa so we're so much smarted than western civilisation"", like when she shrugs at person using an iPhone as primitive, just to follow with 2 hours of fighting with sticks ( some pointy, some actual wooden sticks) .Skip this one and remember MCU for what it used to be, not what it has become."
3," The tagline ""Forever"" is correct. This film felt like it went on forever.
",aligeejay,/user/ur41701792/,2 February 2023,"If you have a spare 161 minutes, I suggest you watch some paint drying. There will be more enjoyment than watching this film.The story made absolutely no sense and did not seem to fit into the MCU, it felt more like a stand-alone reboot of the original Black Panther - which was outstanding.If the film turned out to bad, it would have been better than this and would have scored higher, but only just.The several night time scenes were so dark and under-lit that you could barely see the characters.To make this even worse, there is meant to be a third Blank Panther!Marvel should really have stopped these films after Endgame."
1," Marvel ......just not what it used to be !
",horton-62646,/user/ur71803652/,2 February 2023,"Having waited for this to come out in the pictures I gave it a few days just to let the super die hard fans get their fix and then I stood in line waiting and looking forward to the latest Marvel blockbuster , only to wish I had saved my money and watched it on Disney ( although I would have missed out on the popcorn and hotdog ) because Disney has a fast forward button .The film was a snooze fest , with a very slow and boring plot . Yes I know it wasn't technically a Black Panther movie , but at least make it exciting , it was too long and drawn out in every scene , it could have been a great movie for 90 minutes ( probably not even that though ) .To sum up, I thought the new Thor movie was the worst Marvel could produce , turns out I was wrong !"
3," A Tonally Inconsistent Mess
",Rabutops,/user/ur33887682/,2 February 2023,"This movie goes from somber to political drama to hyper-macho action to sitcom and everywhere in between in the first 30 minutes and it only gets worse as it goes on. The dramatic tonal shifts throughout the movie make for insufferable pacing, I was already checking my watch before the one hour mark.Cartoony looking whales live in a river, Julia Louis Dreyfus has a weird purple clip in in her hair that somehow made her really hard to take seriously, Angela Bassett treats the project like she's on a Shakespearean stage and leaves little breathing room for anyone she shares a scene with, and I won't even start with the cheesy and cringe-worthy dialogue that fills the script.The Marvel Universe needs to stop whatever they're trying to do these past couple of years, because if this is the best they can come up with, I'll pass.The three stars are for the beautiful and sweeping landscape shots, a few cool sets and little else. If you want to waste 3 hours of your time you can certainly find better ways to do so, this ain't it."
9," Nicely done!
",nitishasinghrana,/user/ur161885653/,2 February 2023,"It was slow to pick up but got me gripped after the first half. Honestly, l was scared that Marvel might ruin the journey of Wakanda. It does justice to Black Panther's legacy, and l am looking forward to what will follow. I would also like to see more of Wakandans in the following movies than just the Kings and princesses. I would love to see more of the nation...to be honest, l feel l know more about the people of Talokan than of Wakanda, as in how greatly they feel of their King/God. I have nothing on Wakandans. And BTW why are Wakandans so noble? What makes them so noble..? Is there a story behind that?"
3," Endgame or... End marvel?
",rezadodangeh2,/user/ur43236794/,2 February 2023,"When you look at ""Marvel"" Phase 1, 2 and 3, you really feel the Marvel. Good scripts, good actors, great directions, powerful and stunning special effects, excellent costume and scene design, etc. But starting phase 4, you suddenly feel like you're falling off a mountain, and the further you go, you are getting closer to death.Everything is bad! Special effects (except in a few cases), scripts, acting, directions, costume and scene design. After watching some recent Marvel movies, I was convinced that the superhero costumes were designed by a kindergartner!""Marvel"" chose a meaningful name at the end of Infinity Saga: Â«EndgameÂ»
Avengers: Endgame was not just the end of Infinity saga.It was the end of ""Marvel""."
1," What has happened.
",dollysdad,/user/ur146628434/,2 February 2023,"Marvel should be embarrassed by what it's become.A story that relies solely on loss to drive the narrative, that still manages to be somehow flat and uninspiring.CGI that looks like it's been dragged from the early 00's.Characters that are underwhelming and unlikable.Costumes that are embarrassing.Everything about this film, even down to the dialogue has been a struggle to watch. I can honestly not think of one part that was enjoyable. I'm not saying this to be anti establishment or anti-woke, but marvel seriously needs to address what made the first series of films, for the most part, a huge success, and do away with this latest run of utter garbage.I wish this was an isolated incident in the Marvel experience since Endgame, but it's become a regular feature."
4," Wakanda meets Aquaman meets Avatar!
",alper-goekcan,/user/ur46083594/,2 February 2023,Very disappointing movie. At least they could've chosen Okaje as the new black panther! Would've been more credible!What is she 50pounds? And what about that Riri?! Let's put in some home-boy acting girl to attract more younger viewers? At least they've introduced his son at post credits. Then we can look forward to a new franchise with a suitable replacement of the original black panther.Do I have to talk about what my title is saying? Com'on! Water scenes? Water scenes are like musicals where they start to sing and viewers desperately wait for the next spoken scene of the movie. Please guys. We don't need another mermaid movie! While writing my critics I realized how worse this movie was then thought at first. Therefore changing from 6 to even only 4 stars.Not recommended to watch unless you want to ruin the original black panther experience.
7," writing a review only because val's hair
",tatumferree,/user/ur161882118/,2 February 2023,Why! Why was valentina allegra de fontaine in this movie allowed to have that tacky badly purple hair streak in her hair. The original had a classy grey streak. In no professional setting especially a cia Director would be allowed to have a tacky purple hair streak. It didn't fit and bothered me the whole movie! I think her part wasn't even relevant. Black panther 2 was very well done otherwise . Loved the new super hero and his orgin. Loved the tribute to the original black panther. All the actors are great (except Valentina)lol!!!!!!! The movie was so emotional for me! My sons also loved iron heart!
1," Awful
",GamingTrollHD,/user/ur43816753/,2 February 2023,"Im sorry but this was one of the worst movies i've seen in a while. I never write reviews but i felt like i needed to help some people save time they wont get back wasted on this. First and foremost, its boring. The main part of the movie is just complete waste of time nonsense which feels like they just didnt know what to do with the plot without black panther and decided to just make the characters flab their gums for most of the movie. The villain of the movie, complete garbage. Dude flapping his tiny leg wings, ooh menacing.... So in summary. If you dont want to get annoyed and waste your time, go outside, spend time with your family, do something else, but steer clear of this trash."
1," Derivative and Verbose
",rockyandbullwinkle,/user/ur65910378/,2 February 2023,"I am so disappointed. There was soooo much empty and repetitive dialogue that I often found myself nodding off. This ""villian"" reminded me of Mr Nimbus from Rick and Morty. And how many costume changes do you need for one movie? It felt like a fashion show in which the storyline was only contrived to work around the costume changes. There was also not one other marvel character in this movie, where was Iron Man? Oh I know, they were so busy ripping off the iron man suit that they couldn't have the actual Iron Man in the movie. I've got to tell you, there were so many plot holes in this movie it was laughable. Save yourself the time and money, go watch puss n boots instead."
6," Way to long and boring? Yes.
",edwardeggers,/user/ur38963265/,2 February 2023,"I was let down with this one. Action was sub par. Tried to hard to be ""emotionally relevant"". I understand the tribute to Chadwick, but this whole movie was kind of a downer. Way too goodie two shoes. This was almost... almost, as bad as Wonder Woman 2. I don't understand why they had to drag this out for almost three hours. The underwater city was completely non visible because it was so dark. It was also like they were a primitive people. Playing with rocks? No machines? And really can't live out of water. One well placed nuke and the whole civilization is gone. Obviously not a lot of thought went into this one but at least we got some more female lead characters out of it."
5," Hour too long
",thatchermacdonald,/user/ur73048182/,2 February 2023,"Not bad, solid sequel for those yearning for one. For others, possibly contrived, empty, plot void of any real substance, and most certainly way too long. A more concise production could have helped produce a less choppy and drawn out experience (and more digestible to non-believers, if you will).For the other part of the equation, a production studio with more focus on color and imax adaptation could have aided as well. The Wakandan experience is so vibrant and full of life, making one only wonder of the amazing possibilities that could exist if we observed life tbe same way as the Wakandan people."
5," Fish man vs. Panther girl âœ…
",damonpajak,/user/ur157435168/,2 February 2023,"This Wakanda movie felt like forever while watching it. Let's get this out of the way, they pay homage to Chadwick at the beginning but in a very short respectful way. Ok now let's get to the bad, everything else minus Ross and Namor.Let's talk about Namor, was he the villain, was it technology? That felt very unclear. He was very powerful almost too and his vengeance didn't work for me. I was waiting for a second antagonist to show up and then Namor would see Wakanda wasn't the enemy.I hated that Shiri became BP it felt shoehorned in, I know there was no other option but at the end of the movie they basically say her time will be up soon. Once you see the post credit scene you'll know what I mean( speaking of that, how long has passed since..) Either commit or don't Marvel.Ok let's talk about Ironheart. For why?? We didn't need this character and her one dimensional acting and why did she look like RC from Transformers the movie? This movie does not have staying power and it should have been part of another movie not a standalone."
3," Could have been good if they cut 40 min of fluff
",grlym-46849,/user/ur98824201/,2 February 2023,"I really tried to finish this but after 40 minutes I had to turn it off. No chance I'm going to waste another 2 hours of my life to finish it.I gave it a 3 because so many people did their jobs so well. Costume designers, digital artists, prop makers...even the acting was ok.The real problem was focus which was really emphasized by a lack of editing. I am certain that a minimum of 30 minutes could be cut from this movie and nothing would be lost. Often a movie can find more focus when a director is forced to justify a scene to not get cutThis movie had so much waste in the 40 minutes I watched. And still get messy and to be honest I wasn't sure who to even care about.I liked the first movie. But this movie lost the charm of the first completely. I began to route for everyone, but the wakandans. Because how can a nation so advanced yet so selfish to the worlds needs (kind of a superhero trait...and the show seems to make every single wakandan a super hero). They came off aragant and elitist. The aqua people seemed cool but their development and screen time was not enough to make me keep watching.This movie seemed to pander to world issues on nearly every scene and took me out of the fantasy of the movie. Just felt preached too.Did I mention that doting issues? So much wasted film time covering jokes that didn't deliver and nonsense conversationsThe past couple years has been really rough for marvel. Like dc movie bad. I loved the Thor movies until love and thunder(which was terrible)...and even that was better focused and edited than this movie. Dr strange was mediocre at best. Spider-Man was watchable. I think Loki was as the only thing in the past couple years I can rave about. Wandavision was the worst superhero show I've ever seen...and I'm old enough to have seen Flash Gordon.Don't normally have this much to write, but my kid wanted to watch a bit more of the movie ti see if was redeemable...nope, my son just gave up. And I'm done. Thank you. Have a great day."
4," Well, I guess you can't win them all - WW 84 proved that!
",info-90701,/user/ur66306211/,2 February 2023,"This lacked emotional energy on every level. I fell asleep 3 times, and that's not good.Great Directors are not always good Writers and they should accept that. The script of trite, childish and weak, and it didn't have to be. The premise was solid enough, but the treatment of the subject lacked any kind of depth. The result was a lot of moving parts that accomplished very little. It was lightweight, no strong underlying reasons for any of the action, just a bunch of movement, floating in the air. Bad script, vey bad.While some of the music was great, that Finnish, ridiculous techno-pop that ran under too much of the action was annoying and will date this film forever. As well as they did with Black Panther with the music, they went in the complete opposite direction and did equally poorly with this soundtrack. They should have listened to the otherwise timeless 1985 film Ladyhawke with Michelle Pfeiffer and Rutger Hauer to know how thoroughly a dated, annoying, repetitive soundtrack can limit the life of a film, whereas a timeless soundtrack can help a film be bought and played for decades to come.This wasn't horrible, just boring. Next time, don't write."
10," Amazing
",startrekfan72,/user/ur30662136/,2 February 2023,"Folks this is definitely a movie to be seen if you saw the first one then you need to see what kind of forever it's a continuation definitely worth your time.There is definitely a lot of violence in this movie and suggested themes
I would say this is a PG-13 definitely use parental guidance where children are concerned with this film
Also you need to have seen the first film to understand what's going on here there is a lot going on in this filmI'm at a loss is what else to say here
I guess you should just see this film and enjoy it for what it is to each his ownBut definitely not a film for anyone under 13."
3," Waste of time, film, and resources.
",simbartson,/user/ur161870813/,2 February 2023,"So they don't have the actor who portrayed the lead character in the first film. (Which wasn't a superior film IMHO) They grabbed up a little known, seldom used, Marvel comics character and butchered his back story. Added a few random characters to fill in an exceedingly thin story, and a bunch of stuff blowing up. Racial stereotyping is prevalent throughout. Caucasians are the world's evil-doers, while black or brown (or blue) skin equates to mistreatment, victim-hood and oppression. The actors speak both the Wakandan language and English with an east Philly accent. There is no serious linkage to any other MCU characters or plot lines. How did this become a 2.5+ hour epic blockbuster? All the ratings that have pushed this to a score of better than seven must be left by folks involved with the film or looking to further some social justice agenda."
7," Overall an enjoyable movie
",hugovaz-16247,/user/ur134392120/,1 February 2023,"The movie is enjoyable but there are two things that saddened me:1) The lost opportunity to use one of the African languages that Chadwick Boseman ancestors spoke (either Fogni, Limba, Krio or Yoruba, instead of Xhosa).2) Why change Namor backstory? At least Namora ""survived"" the rewrite, but just in name? I don't dislike this Namor, but was expecting Namor the Atlantean.Aside from those two things, I enjoyed the movie. I was afraid that Chadwick's passing would be hushed and not properly addressed but was positively surprised with the homage they gave him in the fist minutes of the film, even making T'Chala passing."
4," Sorry folks, this makes no sense at all...
",bheadher,/user/ur20597848/,1 February 2023,"Has Marvel completely forgotten how to tell a story? It appears so after Thor Love And Thunder...and now this one. There is almost no background, no character building, and a jumbled mess of a script. I can only hope Quantum Mania will restore my faith in Marvel. This does NOT...I think the worst part is that there are scattered action scenes, but no coherence between them...the rest seems to be a lot of meaningless talk talk for the sake of talk...sorry but that is how it comes across to me...oh, and throw in a bunch of incoherent foreign language with subtitles DOES NOT make an interesting movie people, it just distracts the flow..."
1," Wakanda is dead
",nektarios-83655,/user/ur75307625/,1 February 2023,"High hopes for nothing. Didn't even expect anything better but the results are worser, as a marvel fanatic, I'm really pissed.The first half of the movie was actually really dark that I couldn't see anything only hear their voices and struggle my eyes to catch a thing! The second half was great if we are talking about the visuality of the movie itself! You make a movie which is DARK and with black actors get on my nerves. Try watch the movie before you release it!!Despite the unfortunate visuality of the movie, 2 hours were watch of nothing. We waited for a 20 minutes of fighting? I personally thought that they were gonna make the new black panther(suri) stronger than her brother. Hope I hadn't seen it!"
10," A fitting tribute
",stemcgarry,/user/ur39099713/,1 February 2023,"It's a beautiful film if that makes sense. An utterly fitting tribute to a man who made the Black Panther character come to life for so many.This sequel pays a homage to his memory, while being a story of Wakanda, it is engaging and entertaining, but as it's not entirely the Black Panther, it doesn't sink into some attempt to fill his boots or replace him.It starts and comes back to touching memories and montages of Chadwick Boseman who defines this hero, while giving space to a cast of impressive actors to shine their own light and create new stories.RIP Chadwick. The King is Dead, Long Live the King."
3," Made for a sentimental reasons but all over the place!
",danielaustin-735-484497,/user/ur23246639/,1 February 2023,"Well I gave BP:WF a go as it was of Disney. I didn't hold much hope because I never felt like it could be a stand-alone movie. Well sorry to say I was right. The story is all over the place and quite frankly boring. The action is good as all Marvel movies are but it just felt like it was thrown together. Pulling at people heartstrings doesn't make a good movie I'm afraid.The main protagonist is no longer with us which is a big loss. The remaining cast are okay, I mean okay. They do a job but there is no depth to any of them. The story is somewhat bloated. It's far too long and there are some real pacing issues. I found myself nodding off a few times during the movie because I had little interest on what was going on. If you are going to continue with a story without the main lead, you really need some character depth and direction. I didn't find it funny, sad or entertaining so what's to like? Given Marvels success in recent years, this should have been much better. I can't believe people are going this anything better than a 5/10. I've seems all 8.9 and 10/10 on here. Come on people, it's hardly Star Wars, Shawshank or The Godfather!All in all a very weak and long film.No spoilers here but one to avoid unless you are really bored and have 3hrs to kill or sleep."
1," Boring, bad storyline just awful
",bddvpwyd,/user/ur161866237/,1 February 2023,"I lasted just over an hour and realised there was still over an hour of torture remaining, so I decided to take the dog for a walk and I don't even have a dog. Didn't like the avatar rip off characters, iron man or aqua man in this, far too much confusion and a boring story. I'm glad I didn't go to the cinema to pay for this no amount of popcorn could save me. This needed to be much shorter so we get to see action and less story telling, stories which made no sense or have much meaning one where I don't know the ending and one where I won't make an effort to try to find out and I'm not interested."
4," Average
",ryogo2,/user/ur36242533/,1 February 2023,"Just finished watching it and it was quite boring, way too much dialogue for a marvel movie and not enough action. Angela basset overacted to the tenth degree. I don't know why it was called a black panther movie as you barely get any black panther in it.I found the baddies accent in the movie difficult to understand when he was speaking English. I felt like Disney just kept trying to show horn in as many female characters as possible wether they were good characters or not. As far as that terrible attempt at a new iron man in the guise of a black female teenager. Just pathetic, overall a very disappointing movie for me."
2," Obvious T'Challa was carrying the first
",Little-c,/user/ur89899327/,1 February 2023,"I don't know what was more confusing, the plot, the ever-changing dodgy accents or the tech that's now gone far beyond my imaginations limits, and I'm a Scifi fan! So thankful for Shuri, the only saving grace, literally everyone else is unlikeable especially Namor. Not really sure what this film wants to be or why.A tiny little ball of tech can now completely independently, sentiently power a muscle car? How. I really want that broken down somehow. Less than 1 mm of nanotechnology per wheel, brakes, pedals, gears, how is it navigating?I've gone off on a tangent but it sums up the movie when I spent most of it wandering how the car worked due to boredom.Marvels becoming too heavily subtitled, very problematic for my severely dyslexic daughter, such a shame they're not more inclusive."
4," Good acting, poor writing...
",robertjamesrindik,/user/ur43349761/,1 February 2023,"I recently watched ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" and it was a mixed bag. All of the actors delivered strong performances, with Letitia Wright as Shuri standing out for her good humor and heart.However, the writing wasn't as strong as it could've been and the fight scenes were nothing really special. The CGI was also a bit underwhelming, to be completely honest.Overall, I'd say it's worth checking out for the strong performances from the cast, but don't go in expecting it to be as good as the first ""Black Panther."" If you're a fan, it's still worth a watch, but know that it has its flaws."
4," Yelling, CGI and more yelling, and some action
",tygertygerburningbright,/user/ur28300221/,1 February 2023,"I had some expectations but as this is one of my least favourite Marvel universe series for me not such a big surprise.Black panther was mediocre and this is nothing short of in that sense. Wakanda Forever has some more in the plot but still fails to deliver.Acting lacks spirit even when they mourn their king etc. And anything else is extremely dramatic and over the top.Just like any other marvel film this is packed with action and lots of special effects but that's not completely enough to make this film more unique than others.Some scenes, especially with the teenage scientist is cringe and awkward.Nice to watch to kill time but that's all."
8," A beautiful tribute to Chadwick
",michaelmcmillan-17771,/user/ur160276179/,1 February 2023,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever was more than a movie. It was a tribute to an incredible actor and someone who you could truly feel made an impact on all of the actors in this film lives while also still creating a beautiful way to continue the story in a very tasteful wayI personally found the plot of the first black panther movie to be a little dull at times but I felt that this one was super effective in establishing a story arch that allowed for development and growth of the characters and the story. It also did what every Marvel movie should do and that's extend the overall arch of the story and push into the next movie of the phase.Plot:1.5/2There are some truly incredible acting performances in this film and it is heavily driven by the female leads who are so exceptional in their roles. From Wright to Basset to everybody else, the women in this film were allowed to shine and they did so in an absolutely incredible way that brought out the best in these characters and truly made you feel all the emotions they were undertaking
Acting:1.5/2This is such a heartbreaking story at times to tell and a story that should have not to have been told but because of the unfortunate passing of Boseman; they were forced to tell the story of his end and it was done in such a beautiful and poignant way but also incredibly effective for the overall storytelling of the MCU. They used this tragedy to teach us about grief as well as how to live your life pass the death of a loved one and that is a lesson I believe we can all take from this film
Storytelling:1.75/2This film had much more creativeness than the original as I thought the original followed the typical superhero story troph to close. This one however kept aspects of that apart of it whiles also brining unique elements that I believed helped elevate the film and make it a much enjoyable experience to watch
Creativity:1.5/2As one would expect this movie is gorgeous and is shot so incredibly well from start to finish. Being able to completely immerse yourself in the world of Wakanda and the wonders that it brings. The soundtrack is also amazing as well and heightens certain scenes doing exactly what music is supposed to do in movies like this and bring out the best in it.Other Factors:2/2I think rightfully so many people were worried about how Marvel was going to do with the Black Panther saga post the death of Chadwick Boseman but I think what has been proven is that this story was able to done incredibly well and they were able to create a movie that I believe Chadwick would have been incredibly proud of and one that holds its own in MCU lore.Overall:8.25/10."
4," 10/10 for when you want to take a nap
",michaelschilling,/user/ur156537263/,1 February 2023,"I tried to watch this film 3 times and couldn't get past the first 45 minutes without drifting off to sleep. I ended up making it to the end with the fast forward button close in hand. From what I could gather, the film was very shallow and lacking substance. The plot is not interesting and motivations confusing. There were some nice visuals and CGI but ultimately fell short as very disappointing. Even now I'm getting drowsy trying to recall the details. There were major aspects of the plot which the movie just never addressed. I was also saddened to see how they handled the passing of T'Challa. It feels rushed and brushed over, not even giving the audience proper time to mourn themselves. It could have been so much better."
5," Excellent movie except MAJOR fail as it is too dark to watch
",jasonjbinns,/user/ur156553082/,1 February 2023,"The story, the acting, the special effects, are all superb.This would have been a very enjoyable movie EXCEPT for the fact that at least 50% of it is shot in dark settings, and when this is the case you simply can't see anything at all. Major fail as this completely ruins the movie. If you watch in theatres it is almost ok, but if you stream or watch on blu-ray, have fun adjusting your TV's brightness to max (that really didn't help for me...)Not impressed at all. They ruined what is a really good film.Outside of being annoyed the entire film, and if you can get over not being able to see anything but a black screen, the movie is enjoyable. The characters are amazing. The acting was very well done. As if Wakanda wasn't already a huge part of the MCU, this movie puts it over the top."
2," Disappointment in every aspects
",alexpeychev,/user/ur14782607/,1 February 2023,"Most boring Marvel movie yetWe understand that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever won't be the same as what it used to carry but still thinking of some flashy action scenes or a few mesmerizing displays of characters which the movie failed to do so.__ The movie felt like more or less a family drama with no strong plot for why the agony started in the first place. So if you want to see people just being emotional while wearing costumes, this movie is just for you._ Also if you are expecting some interesting turns of events that will disappoint you also. The movie goes in the usual MCU ways and does not significantly represent the way a Black Panther movie should be.__ So if you have seen the trailer, you already have seen the whole movie and would find nothing new.A depressing end to a disappointing Phase 4."
6," Namor is much better a king
",i-62067,/user/ur161856593/,1 February 2023,"I have just watched this movie. At the end, I really wish Namor to win the battle. They lived in peace and away from other countries. Wakanda had made some many problems. They had civil war and accidentally revealed Namor's country. Namor did go to negotiate with Wakanda before fighting back. He treat Suri kindly in his country. He was also able to let down his pride and to yield to his enemy for his people. I just feel unfair for Namor and their people.In addition, the suits in black panther 2 are all very terrible. Also, there are too many scenes when people just mindlessly touching screens and talk. The worst part is the gene editing. You don't need a 3D structure of DNA for gene editing. If they want to make their science scene better, they need to consult a scientist."

",vigarlunaris,/user/ur40982820/,1 February 2023,"Good that I saw the film ""only"" on Disney+ and thus did not spend money on the cinema, because to sum it up, the film is not worth a single dollar!The characters from the first part are compulsively rehashed, the graphics are made even prettier and then you rush from one scene to the next and get entangled in a story at the end of which two ""tribes"" go to war against each other to then... well, I don't want to spoil.If you have Disney+ you can watch the movie. I wouldn't spend money on it and I'm honestly disappointed that this was released under the Marvel label.For those who want to see a rehash of the second cast of the first part and associated much and exaggerated female power, can enjoy the film, all others should rather wait until a real Marvel film appears again."
3," It was good for 45 minutes
",anderson-usmc,/user/ur12074505/,1 February 2023,"This has to be the worst Marvel money grab to date. I tried to like it, but it is truly aweful. I would have given it 0 stars but we all know the algorithm filters out the best and worst reviews. I give it 3 stars because it was a movie, and there were actors in it, but this is a horrible movie.It started off pretty good, got me interested, and then it took a hard turn south, I don't wanna spoil anything but after the 45 minute mark you should go watch something else. I'm not sure what to tell you, this movie is a travesty that should not be rated anywhere near a 7. It's a solid 3 at best. So much potential wasted."
7," Stands out from the conventional Marvel!
",SoumikBanerjee25,/user/ur46919419/,1 February 2023,"Is it just me, or does this stand out from the rest of the Marvel movies, particularly those released recently? I believe the studio gave director Ryan Coogler free rein to do whatever he wanted with the film, and it shows in his presentation, which is emotionally satisfying and pays tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman!Unlike conventional Marvel, the narrative here slows down as well as cuts down on the action to give each of the main characters sufficient space to prosper. As a result, not only was the story endowed by compelling characters and performances (Angela Bassett and Danai Gurira were standouts for me), but it also massively contributed to the creation of a beautiful world full of wonders and awe.Here I have a question, was James Cameron involved in the creation of this new world? Was he involved in the process in any way? Look I'm not kidding, I'm actually serious; the people of Talokan do bear similarities to the Metkayina clan of Na'vi people in Avatar, I'm not sure if it's just a crazy coincidence or if there's actually some backstory to it, I really wanna know."
8," Tribute to Chadwick. Strong.
",moviesknight,/user/ur114822238/,1 February 2023,"One of the few films in the MCU, that has so many interesting characters and Ryan is doing the justice to them. Queen, M'Baku, Shuri, Nakia, Ross, dora milaje, and each character is so powerful to the story. Not some background characters. This is not seen in other MCU films. The first half of this film was so powerful, it really means what Chadwick means to all of the cast and crew. Loved that. Good story but was disappointed with Namor and the ending fight in ocean. Marvel visual studios need to do better. You are earning a ton load of money, invest them on people who do the work. Visuals could have been far better. The acting and also the emotional connection with that... so strong. You wouldn't believe. She shows why she is the queen mother. Angella Bassett nails this performance as an actor, mother and queen. Loved the emotions portrayed in this film. Maybe the ending should have been kept open without the last fight and continue this in next part. This should have been a superhero film about grief, with no actions fights. They serve no purpose to what they were trying to achieve. But nonetheless a wonderful goodbye to Chadwick."

Why are Wakandans speaking english? Oh right, to sell this movie back to the colonisers.

2," Absolutely dreadful sequel
",darapjohnson,/user/ur107935027/,1 February 2023,"The only reason I watched ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" was because of my obligatory completionist mindset of watching ALL MCU movies that gets put out, and in return I have to sit through pure garbage like this, I mean come on. What even was this?First of all, this movie focused way too much on the loss of the late great Chadwick Boseman and instead of just using a short time on that and the rest on the plot, they instead focused mostly on Chadwick and very little on plot. It's truly a shame. But i'm not even that mad, since I did expect this little from this awful sequel.On top of that, it was very unnecessarily long. I felt like I wasted 2 hours and 46 minutes of my life which i'll never get back. Everything after Endgame sucks, and this is by far no exception. This might even be up there for my least favorite MCU movie, right up there with Eternals and Black Widow. Also, let's not talk about the awful casting of Namor. Absolutely dreadful, don't recommend."
6," Boseman forever
",rehmankhilji,/user/ur24755804/,1 February 2023,"Boseman surely has made the role of Black Panther immortal. Even after his sad passing hai presence could be felt throughout the movie. Some part for very odd reason was expecting the black panther to just come back, through CGI or any other use.Nevertheless the team surely gave their best in memory of the one lost.As for the movie, not good then the previous ones but still very much worth watching. This is marvel universe and each of them is full on entertainment. Found it to be a bit stretched out in length.Cut to the chase, it is fun, good to watch and undoubtedly this one is for Boseman."
2," Better title is Wakanda Whatever
",stevelivesey-37183,/user/ur65202757/,1 February 2023,"The first few minutes are fairly good. Black Panther is dead, Namor is established as a character. And that's it.After that the movie falls off a cliff in terms of believability, plot, effects, writing etc. All of it and I mean all of it is terrible.The girl that creates vibranium seeking submarines in her dads garage and then goes on to make her own iron man suit is absolutely ridiculous. The fight scenes at the first have the Avatar lite things all powerful, but when the plot needs then to, they become weak again.The cgi is awful especially in the fight scenes.They will make another, unfortunately, but Marvel really has lost its way."
8," An outstanding sequel!!!
",abirchy-96827,/user/ur134959333/,1 February 2023,"I don't know why this movie is getting some kind of hatred..Maybe the main reason is Chadwick Boseman is not the main character here and someone else is replaced in his place...
This reason may piss some people but if we can just ignore that fact then I really don't think this is a bad movie after all considering what we are getting in Phase-4..This movie also gives us some important practical life lessons. Such a Vengeance can comsume everything and how much it can cost. It also teaches us life never stand still. The world will keep moving on even after we are gone. I don't know about everyone but these things personally hit me while watching the movie...This movie had some cool action scenes too. Unlike Taskmaster in ""Black Widow "" which was not properly portrayed here I think Namor is perfectly portrayed as a Villain. We were understanding the motive behind what he was doing. I think they have made a good job on this...This movie is definitely worth watching and brings officially a perfect end of Phase - 4.. Hopefully Phase - 5&6 will be great..Don't miss the mid credit scene. It will almost change your perspective of the movie ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€In memory of Chadwick Boseman!! ðŸ’”ðŸ’”"
3," Not Interesting
",marc5477,/user/ur43600791/,1 February 2023,"No need to beat a dead horse, so ill summarize it as bad plot and generic copycat characters.This movie really pushed my boredom to the limits. They spend too much time on ceremonies and fantasy lore and almost no time developing the plot. The spent an inordinate amount of time on character development but I still felt nothing for any of them.This reminded me a lot of the new Dune where the acting seemed ok, and certainly, the movie looked great, but I couldnt care for any of the characters in any way. I felt similarly about Namor and his mermaid people who seemed more like empty plot points than real adversaries.Id skip it."
2," MCU fatigue!

That's a stupid plotNamor was a good villain at the beginning despite the bad plot but the end.. that was hilarious... I was really laughing so hard! He attacked Wakanda and killed the Queen creating chaos and yet he will say yes to Shuri (stupid Black Panther choice ) to conclude a deal... just like that.... Shuri just lost her mom because of Namor but they will create an alliance? Wow i'm not that stupid to accept such a mediocrity. 2 stars just for the Boseman memory!The MCU are getting horrible after every movie for a few years!"

I skipped all of it and still didn't finish. It's very predictable. Seriously? How does Hollywood rope in so many people and dupe them this hard? People make money tirelessly and spend it on junk lile this? It's quite remarkable how snares like this and other movies bring in so much movie. At the end, people are like, ""wait, I spent money and time on this."" Well I didn't watch the movie, I pretty much skipped through it just to get a sense of it and my, how awful it was. Tragic."

One super technically evolved race of almost super humans going up against another civilization of even More powerful beings! Thats gonna make for some mindblowing conflict on a huge scale...As far as the new Black Panther?I have to say that I would have preferred
that it be played by a male only because of the physicality of the role. While a female in this case is Enhanced far beyond her own limitations to levels of great strength, it just seemed less believeable especially in the fight scenes
requiring her to go up against, not just men, but superhuman men...That said, the actress does an excellent job ...Gender swapping of established roles seems to be the Thing these days and here ,its no exception..How anyone would not be thoroughly entertained and frankly, blown away by this movie is beyond me...It stands head and shoulders above most of the super hero movies from DC and Marvel that have come out recently..This one is a keeper for me and thats rare these days..Its one of my all time favorites that I look forward to watching again.

The only accurate part about the movie is that it felt like Forever to finish. Bad acting does not help either. Dialogue is poor, performances are weak. Boring and waste of time.Save yourself time and money and do yourself a favor. Don't watch it. I will not be watching if they make any Wakanda sequel.Don't believe the over-ratings.

Absolutely no plot, logic, etc. I lost count on scenes where the movie could be solved in a single conversation or applying basic physics or chemistry. My brain will not recover from this monstrosity of a movie... But CGI is good, so it gives additional +2 points. Of course anytime it made me though about Chadwick I cried a little. No additional points for than because it's just playing on simple emotions and not ona a movie layer basis, as it should be. If not for the physics or chemistry I wish Marvel movies could simply not contradict each other on ""magical-logical"" universe they create, that would be fine, thanks."

Wakanda is no longer even a semblance of a secret African country, just a location where black people are playing dress up in a movie. A lot of the storylines just fell flat. Some characters just appeared for 2 minutes and never heard of again.At times there was so much dialogue which did nothing to further the plot, where was the editing team? There are very few actors who can captivate the audience with their words none of those actors happened to be in this movie.The CGI was good and the action was pretty good. Its a Marvel superhero movie so I didn't expect much more than this. Black Panther was always a favorite comic book hero of mine and I am saddened that they could not do better for that legacy."

It felt like I was watching a kids movie.The whole movie was based on a bunch of nothing. The fight between wakanda and Namor was pointless when they eventually agree on what namor had proposed at first.Wasted opportunity all over in this movie and pointless jokes, pointless emotions everything was just meaningless in the end.Ryan coogler messed this one up, he could have shown some intelligence in these kingdoms but instead he showed therm as shallow as politicians are, fighting all the time for pointless things and resources. Exploiting the masses basically."
2," Disappointment, what more can I say
",nicholaskoeppel,/user/ur161791376/,31 January 2023,"Based on other's reviews, I had such high hopes...The plot is bad, like really bad... nothing makes sense, and resources are wasted left and right, with absolutely no advancement what so ever...Ships are used when it's convenient, and normal whales are indestructible transports used by underwater supermen...The starting point of this Movie: involves the use of a device to find vibranium; which is successful, it's then revealed there are only two locations where this magical metal exists, and the underwater people spend the rest of movie... searching for the ""scientist"" who made the device(even though the location has already been discovered).It then turns out the ""scientist"" is just a college girl, with cringe after cringe recall to cheap imitations of past Marvel themes... At one point, the police literally exclaim, ""she's got an Ironman suit""; which she then uses, to kill a ton of police, and no one seems to care; or thinks to use a ship to just escape.The water people(who's legend just barely makes sense), live so deep in the Ocean; it's near impossible to get there, and all their people have in human amounts of strength...The main villain is so powerful: he's basically indestructible, with no weaknesses; except getting too dry... which still isn't a deal breaker, and only slightly limits what he can do.I'm not sure where these 5 and higher reviews are coming from... My only guess is... they gave a review without having actually watched this movie...In the end: it's just lazy writing, given to badly developed characters, that exist in the Marvel universe...

",nikozborn,/user/ur51857864/,31 January 2023,"Man...where to start on this disaster of a movie. Losing Boseman really killed the franchise unfortunately and I'd never say a bad word about Chadwick as I thought he was fabulous and perfect as BP. A Black Panther movie without the titular hero didn't seem like a good idea in theory and unfortunately that's what transpired in this film. None of the Wakandan side characters are all that interesting to start with. Their acting (apart from Bassett) is horrible. The girl that played Rori was annoying and extremely unlikable. Namor, however, absolutely crushed it. He kind of carried this awful movie. The director is also horrible. His movies are terrible. The writing was so dumb and there were so many plot holes and mistakes. They should have recasted BP honestly. I think that and a competent director/script are the only things that could have saved this atrocious movie. RIP T'Challa and the MCU."

",Gaikokujiin,/user/ur88929967/,30 January 2023,"From all new or the latest Marvel movies and compared with Black Panther's last movies, this is the best. It has a connection with the past and also presents a new future in a great way. Without her brother and mother, she should put all burdens into her shoulders while learning from the past mistakes and deficiencies of their technology. The new technology looks similar to J. A. R. V. I. S and Iron Man, but they use Vibranium as the main component. Hopefully, the next movie could maintain great connectivity, the human-being side, and the innovation to surpass the obstacles. Great job and keep this."

",ffcnick,/user/ur79623327/,29 January 2023,"Where do we start, the plot I guess. Its just a poorly written script based on an even worse storyline. The acting is quite appalling when you consider the budget these films have it is scandalous to think they can't find any convincing actors but I guess they're not bothered about the quality. I breve it's got to a point that these Marvel franchise films are just so complacent that they feel they can just churn out any old story, regardless to how poor it is and expect a very healthy profit and sadly this does seem to be true. There is a reason for this which won't be discussed at this time but is a sad reflection of where we have gad to come to.

God knows what changed between then and now.Wakanda forever is probably the deepest marvel movie I have seen, full of soul, exploring loss, revival and to what lengths people can go to protect their own. In between all the human stuff was a marvel story which some great action.The selfishness of humans is also explored, the typical dirty American tactics to get what is not theirs, funny how its the Americans that are the true antagonists of this movie and not the water people, yet you will think its them, just like in real life.To conclude, this movie is bold and deep with amazing effects, every actor played their part, no one for me stood out, the true star was the background score.Wakanda Forever!!!!!!"
7," Some more drama, action, spectacle and special effects
",madanmarwah,/user/ur82438476/,28 January 2023,"One more sequel where the earlier movie was better most probably because we had the late Chadwick Boseman in the title role. He is sorely missed in this sequel which is a notch lower because the screenplay is not exactly gripping. The story starts off with the death of King T'Challa despite desperate efforts by his sister ( An AI expert busy all the time in her R and D lab). The mantle falls on mother Queen Ramoda to protect the kingdom of Wakanda from foreign interference and to ensure supremacy among the top nations. The focus is then on palace intrigues leading to incidents of family loss and the following agony. An in the case of the oppression of natives to get unobtanium in Avatar, here something similar is taking place where other nations are planning to snatch the reserves of vibranium. ( I hope I have got the names right).Director Ryan Coogler has ensured that the movie has enough of drama, action and special effects to keep the audience hooked. We have scenes of an epic sea battle followed by exciting hand to hand combat which should please fans. The movie has high class production design and costumes. There are scenes of an underwater kingdom which are worth seeing. The director is helped by some very effective acting by Angela Basset and Lupita Nyongo. The former may pick up an Oscar after a few weeks. The end credits has the tuneful Rihanna song "" Lift me up"" which might pick up an Oscar. A short scene post the credits is very well done and is a nice surprise."
3," Sorry but Mediocre at best
",brandont-25887,/user/ur93616176/,27 January 2023,"The first black panther movie got a lot of hype for two reasons. The first was the culture, cast, and history out into the movie. The second was that the story and plot were pretty good and it made sense. This new film obviously didn't take any of that into consideration this time around. The story was sloppy and a mess. The motivation of the antagonist was blurry and unclear. I understand the needed pivot when Chadwick Boseman Died, may he rest in peace, but this was definitely not the way to go. The main antagonist Namor's motivation to kill a 19 year old college student that made a machine that could find vibranium for a college project is totally out of character of a king. The reason why he decides this is ""to protect his people"" and yet in the end he puts all of them in danger and the line of fire just for this girl who made the tech for a COLLEGE PROJECT. It's absolutely ridiculous and reckless. If he had been a king all this time he would never do something with so much risk for such little reward. Not to mention Suri offered to help him and offer her forces if they agreed to leave her alone, WHICH WAS A PERFECT DEAL, considering that exactly how it all ended. He wasted lives and time and gained next to nothing. The movie was confusing and just felt mushed together. Left the movie's disappointed."

",User145111,/user/ur149041077/,27 January 2023,"The modern opinion of the MCU is that it is quickly fading and that the superhero bubble as a whole is soon going to burst. This film is more fuel to that fire. The Ironheart suit is awful. Looks terrible & out of place among everything else it shares a scene with. Everything about this film is miserable and horrible. A big aspect of the marketing was the mystery of who the new Black panther will be. Although it was obviously Suri as no one else is even close to being that thin. Why should the audience care about a character wearing an indestructible cat suit? There are no stakes to it. Namor is good. Everything else is boring, nonsensical and drawn out to a tedious 3 hours."
6," A very mediocre movie
",lorenzonicoli-98494,/user/ur159305061/,26 January 2023,"Really? Is this one of the most appreciated Marvel movies of the last two years? Just let me explain. This movie is not bad, it's just...average. The plot is really simple, just the classic hero that tries to save his (or her?) kingdom from a threatening new menace, who is Namor (that i must admit, he's one of the most characterized villains of all time in the MCU). The problem of this movie is the length, two and a half hours to explain a story that it would have taken just 2 hours maximum is too much. Then again, the tribute to Chadwick Boseman was really beautiful, but you can't just judge an entire film based on the commemoration of that actor. This movie is just really boring, too slow, and the third and final act is mediocre to say the least, with the final fight of the new Black Panther and Namor that lasts something like...30 seconds? (and i am really generous). It's another mediocre film of the phase 4, Ryan Coogler just had no ideas how to write this new film and decided to base the entire narration about loss and family themes but, unfortunately, it didn't work really well for him."

I even made an effort to forget Ms Wright's covid nuttiness.The acting was mostly quite good, especially Angela Bassett.. of course. Winston Duke (M'Baku) was again very charming and likeable, but also wise.The whole ironheart addition seemed awfully convenient and too quickly moved from basic idea to 'just as good as iron man'. Nothing developed with her. Very weak character poorly written.I did like Namor's portrayal and the spin the movie put on him. He was mad and powerful, but at the very end seemed almost evil, which was wrong. He's a jerk in the comics, for sure. And he cares for his people above all, but evil... nah.Overall it was just a bit weak and predictable. What everyone loved about Black Panther was the heart, and this felt mostly flat after the first 20 minutes or so."

The acting of each of these ladies, especially Wright and Bassett, was just perfection. I didn't think there was any way I could accept Shuri as Black Panther, but now I do.This would have been a 10/10, but....the darkness of so many scenes was just ridiculous.

Which is kind of weird, since the film has a generally acceptable IMDb rating of 7.2 (as I write this), only a tenth of a point lower than the first Black Panther movie. It's just something I noticed and wanted to comment on.With that said, I'll probably get hit with the negatives here as I found the movie generally okay for a super-hero flick. Not being a Marvel or Black Panther fan, the story line held up pretty well, although there were elements that defied logic that brought the experience down somewhat. When Shuri (Letitia Wright) was impaled in her fight with Namor (Tenoch Huerta), it looked like she was a goner, and with no explanation how that could be, it left a giant question mark. Same with the blue fighters on Namor's side; how did they simply get up and walk away after being struck down in an early fight scene against General Okoye (Danai Gurira). Without resorting to magic or supernatural forces, these things deserve clarification.Now I understand Namor's hate and distrust of the surface world, but it actually bothered me that he turned into the movie's villain. There was a lot of promise for Namor and the Wakandans, especially Shuri, to find common ground to oppose the global attempt to discover vibranium. Namor's headstrong, one-sided view about killing Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne) if Shuri wouldn't side with him to make war on the rest of the world felt decidedly irrational. On the flip side, Shuri escaping with Riri from Talokan instead of trying to convince Namor of a more reasonable alliance almost felt like a betrayal, since they had a generally good rapport up till then. So when Namor eventually attacked Wakanda with his forces, I found it hard to process that the two sides were actually going to war with each other.The book end tributes to Chadwick Boseman were well done, and helped to establish his legacy as a principal in the Marvel universe. What left me scratching my head was that mid-credits scene which revealed the son of King T'Challa and his mother Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o). Coming out of left field like that was another puzzler, because to my recollection, there wasn't even a hint of a relationship between T'Challa and Nakia in the first movie. Could be wrong there since I find it impossible to remember without going back for a re-watch, which I'm just not going to do. As for my rating, I do give it a notch below my vote for the first Black Panther film for the reasons cited. Hopefully the writers will fix some of the inconsistencies in the third film."
10," Great Representation
",lovesnowangel4,/user/ur57159845/,23 January 2023,I loved the first one and I loved the second one even more! The first and second Black Panther have great representation and an excellent story with awesome action!Might make you cry on some scenes. So a captivating story.The actors/actresses did amazing! Very believable and truly sold the role!Look forward to seeing more in the future! They added a few new comic book characters that I'm sure we'll see more of in the future and I'm intrigued at how they'll include them in the marvel cinematic universe.Rest In Peace Chadwick Boseman! You would have loved what they did to the movie.A very respectful send off they gave him.
2," An hour too long
",gsvep,/user/ur35678285/,22 January 2023,"I didn't have high expectations but it didn't reach those. The acting was stilted, there was no storyline and parts dragged so much that I nodded off several times (and didn't miss anything important). The water people's origin story was ridiculous and the king was completely un likable. Spoiler...So there are 2 groups of individuals who have a mineral/metal that could be used to destroy the planet and they start a war with each other because the white people want to steal the metal from them?... The blue people didn't even introduce themselves before they gave the Wakandans an ultimatum. I kept thinking, rip off their face masks, they won't be able to breath...end of battle. They only reason I sat thru this was to see the beautiful costumes."
9," A Beautiful Tribute
",isafairoz,/user/ur161418055/,22 January 2023,"This movie blew me away. I had low expectations going in, but Ryan Coogler and the rest of the team did an amazing job to honor Chadwick's legacy. The soundtrack is the greatest in any Marvel movie I have ever seen, the costume design is excellent, and the antagonist Namor is incredible. Once again Marvel is able to make a likeable, relatable, and understandable antagonist. I was absolutely blown away by the underwater world of Talokan. The incorporation of ancient Mayan culture was executed very well. Angela Basset and Tenoch Huerta were also exceptional in their roles. I am looking foward to the future of the black panther series and I'm excited to return to Wakanda again one day."
10," Another amazing movie by Ryan Coogler ğŸ‘�
",aop-69630,/user/ur158847670/,21 January 2023,This sequel especially considering all the difficulties it had to overcome with the pandemic and the sudden death of its main character was a masterpiece of fiction that confirms Ryan Coogler place amongst the best writer/directors in Hollywood. It was visually stunning and emotionally moving. A combination of strong acting by not only the main characters but even the others who were just making a brief cameo plus a well written storyline that retcons Namor's over told background made this a joy for me. I know it's the cool guy thing nowadays to hate on any Disney or marvel product but this movie emphatically proves that the MCU is back!
7," Fantastic
",telishajosephs,/user/ur154717758/,18 January 2023,"I believe that Wakanda Forever is one of the better Marvel movies;
for the most part, because it is (To my knowledge) the only Marvel movie that is mainly a WOC & a majority female cast. I also think it is written wonderfully and shows all types of WOC, not just stereotypes. Additionally, the CGI is extremely well done, it made me feel as though I was in the movie itself. Also, the fight scenes were seemingly very accurate, well the whole movie seemed to be extremely accurate in all of its writing, character-wise (especially with the representations of African cultures) and violence-wise. I think this movie is such a good face for Marvel because it shows young girls (especially POC) that girls and women are equally as important to justice as men (even if it is all fictional)."
7," Better than the First, Just short of Great
",koltonbrett,/user/ur144012653/,17 January 2023,"Wakanda Forever is like a cool combination of Black Panther, Aquaman, and Avatar. It's pretty fun, but also heartfelt. They chose a good direction to go in with this Black Panther sequel. Shuri is the star of the show as actress Letitia Wright earned her money for this film. She delivers a heartfelt performance that honors the late Black Panther star, Chadwick Boseman. The action in this film is everything I wanted out of the first Black Panther film. It's exciting and thrilling with awesome special affects.Tenoch Huerta knocks it out of the park as Namor, who is a fantastic villain. Not every actor could play a guy flying around by his little ankle wings and still demand you take him seriously, but Huerta pulls it off.It's not a perfect superhero film. The scenes between the action sequences go a little long and disrupt the pacing some. And Riri (Ironheart) didn't add anything of much worth to the movie. She's definitely no Tony Stark and she didn't establish herself as a character that mustered up excitement to see more of. Disney isn't doing the best job right now passing the torch between its MCU characters, with one exception being the character of Black Panther. Letitia Wright has stepped up and respectfully picked up the torch from Chadwick Boseman and she's running with it."
8," Un tentativo ragionevole di realizzare un film Marvel serio.
",danieledri-72668,/user/ur160138177/,17 January 2023,"Visually a good movie, I just enjoyed seeing the beauty of this movie. Marvel as usual try to do something different, but this time they tried to make a serious movie. Of course they failed, the movie tries to be serious but sometimes it doesn't seem that way. The fact that the film is for the age of 12+ does not help in my opinion, if the film was for the age of 12+ it would have reached a different league. In conclusion, if you want an action movie that reminds you of Shang Chi, go for this movie. By the way, in my opinion, the movie is suitable for ages 9+. Bye, remember the name Daniel Adri."

",renitamj,/user/ur127686044/,15 January 2023,"Honestly such a good movie, I really wish I can watch it again in theatres. Really really enjoyed it and how they adapted the film from the first one. I think it's better than the first one. I loved that there were strong female lead characters. They did such a good job with their acting and presence. Did not know what to expect before watching the movie especially because Chadwick is no longer here with us and therefore the black panther was gone...so I thought. However, I watched a lot of movies this year and I definitely would put Black Panther forever at the top of my list. So worth a watch!!"
10," excellent...
",zeynepranap,/user/ur160829455/,12 January 2023,"Honestly, I had zero expectations because I did not know what they were going to do with the movie but it was amazing. Letitia's and Angela's acting was AMAZING. Also, I bawled my eyes out in the movie, like I got headaches because of it... they handled the loss of Chadwick well, it did not disrespect him or the role. There were a few holes in the script, I am assuming they were explained in the deleted scenes but yeah there are some moments which feel superficial as they were not explained enough. The ending also got me crying too, I think they are going to make the little tchalla the next black panther, therefore, carry the black panther plans they had done for Chadwick through. Extremely excited about what's coming for us."
7," Black Panther: Wakanda Forever - A Messy, But Powerful, Sendoff
",strabgerthings,/user/ur112392331/,10 January 2023,"This movie is sort of all over the place. There are too many bloated plotlines crammed into one movie that kind of sour the overall experience just a small bit. But other than that I can say that I enjoyed this movie a lot. I thought the villains were pretty cool, well written and intimidating enough. The performances are great, with Angela Basset as the standout. Like I said earlier, the plot feels a little bloated and at some points rushed, especially in the second act. This leads into the almost 3 hour runtime. There are some scenes that drag on a little too long, but there are also some scenes that I thought should have gone on longer. But thise are my only real complaints with this movie. The sendoff for Chadwick Boseman was incredibly done and emotional. Overall, I thought this was really a good, satisfying movie, and a powerful goodbye to Chadwick Boseman."
6," BIT DIFFERENT FROM THE USUAL
",nizzambaharuddin,/user/ur110657248/,9 January 2023,"MINOR SPOILER ALERTI have to admit that I wasn't necessarily fond of the first Black Panther film. Sure, it has a lot of potential which was set up quite nicely in the film. But I feel like the conclusion and the entire third act to be quite weak, especially the CGI (which we now know isn't the VFX studio's fault). But like I said I did enjoy the worldbuilding and the overall tone. Just that I feel it suffers from the usual fate like all the other MCU films did; great set up but a lame execution.Fast forward to this film, I was intrigued when I saw the trailer because it seems like a good set up. But I do wonder how they were going to tackle the issue of the main protagonist. On the whole set up, it is rather quite good for the most part. I enjoyed the part where Talokan and the whole sea people were introduced. I even liked the horror elements they implemented. You should be afraid of something that is unknown. I also liked the decision to change Atlantis into Talokan, and have it basically have ancient Aztec myths behind it. Very fresh and very smart to differentiate him from Aquaman. But I feel like that's about it in terms of good things that I enjoy in the film.I feel like the inclusion of Riri Williams is probably the most pointless addition to the plot. She's there basically just to promote her upcoming Disney+ series, and nothing else. Yes, she's an integral part of the plot, but by the end I feel like they could have just used Shuri for that. It's also the same problem I find in other Disney+ series (like how the ending of Falcon & Winter Soldier doesn't further the plot of the start, which makes it feel just like filler episodes).Also there tons of decisions that are pretty stupid from characters that are supposed to be very experienced (or basically immortal). And as always with MCU films, I find the third act to be rather dull and underwhelming. It set up quite nicely, only to disappoint me a bit in the end. The fights are pretty tame and lame too, compared to say the bridge scene. But hey, at least the CGI is better than the first film. The emotional scenes also failed to tug at my heartstrings, if compared to No Way Home for instance. It doesn't deserveOverall, I actually prefer this film rather than the first film. And I actually like this film's overall tone rather than other MCU films which can be almost insufferable with their one-liners and jokes at every other minute. But in the end, it still suffers the same fate as other MCU films. And that's just sad."
6," Solid Sequel with Decent Arcs
",dalyons-09311,/user/ur160898635/,9 January 2023,"This was much better than I thought it would be. Despite Boseman's passing, the movie does not feel like it was hacked together or that anything was unintentional. They made it feel like this was the plan all along, which I'm really impressed by. This is really just a movie about Shuri's character arc, so that's all I'm going to talk about. As with most Marvel, the action, CGI, and humor are decent. The third act is a little disappointing action-wise, but it's fine. It's decent Marvel. Shuri's character arc is incredible. Basically, the point of this movie is that, following T'Challa's death, Shuri has two choices. She can either become her brother, not let her anger consume her, and move on, or she can become Killmonger and burn the world down in anger. The acting is very effective here, and I thought it went really well. If that was the whole movie, I would've given it a much better rating. The problem is the villain. Namor's inclusion in the movie not only makes very little sense, but also corrupts Shuri's arc. Namor gives Shuri an ultimatum. She can either help him destroy the whole world, or Wakanda can be the first place to be exterminated. Right off the bat, that makes no sense. Namor has nothing against Wakanda. People loved Killmonger because he was a sympathetic yet charismatic and ruthless villain. Namor is not sympathetic. Yes, he has a tragic backstory, but rather than ""kill slaveowners"" or ""kill the Spanish,"" his motivation is now ""kill everyone"" and then becomes ""kill Wakanda."" He's basically just a mass murderer with no clear motivation, which is not entertaining. You don't get a sense that he has some sort of coherent goal or vision, whereas Killmonger had both of those things. Namor kind of just wants to kill people. As a villain, it's really disappointing. But the bigger problem is that Shuri's choice is no longer hers to make. Namor has artificially injected himself into that choice. He makes it so that if she doesn't help him, Wakanda dies. Putting ridiculous stakes into her choice detracts from what made it so great. The point is that the stakes were relatively low and that it was about what kind of person she wanted to be. Namor turned a character arc into a movie arc and, as a result, sucked the life out of it, making it far less interesting. So I think Marvel constructed a fantastic character arc, but their insistence on including a villain rather than pulling an Inception and having it be a character-driven experience with no villain really hurt them."
5," An exciting let down
",jparkergomez,/user/ur160743932/,8 January 2023,"Black Panther was new. It was exciting. It was something everyone loves. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever changed that whole perspective.The first Black Panther is great, perhaps one of my favourite Marvel films. It's great to see Chadwick Boseman and a black man as the star of a superhero film. This definitely helps give confidence to black people. Wakanda Forever does better at this, all the leads are black however, specifically empowering black women which I know many people would appreciate including myself.To start with, the music is my favourite aspect of the film. Every single song is good from orchestrated arrangements to pop songs. The diegetic and the non diegetic sounds gives the film a good feeling and is fun to listen to. The cinematography is also well planned out, the shots and some sequences are surprising especially for a marvel film.The film as a whole seems like a money making project; it did not seem whole. For example, although they portray black women as powerful throughout the film it seems as though that is the purpose of the film, to encourage more viewers in order to make more money. It did not seem genuine they cared about expressing the empowerment the women had.Another massive weakness of the film is the plot. It was empty. It seemed as though nothing really happened. It felt like a massive circle; everything seemed pointless. The whole film had been building up for this final dilemma for it to go to nothing. It just felt like a filler for another story and another film to come out from the idea.Although the plot may have seemed aimless, it did not lack excitement or adrenaline. There are a fair number of fight scenes. It gives it a much more energetic feeling; after all, that's what marvel seems to be good at. That's what makes it fun, that and the comedy, two aspects that always work together in a marvel film.A feature that definitely stands out to me is the acting, it is passionate, not like any marvel film I had seen before. It left me slightly surprised but the acting just put more emphasis on the emotions of the film and how the characters felt, contrasting from the comedy. It is able to explore different feelings giving the viewer a more dramatic experience.Overall, the first film definitely is worth your time. With the second one, unless you are a die hard marvel fan don't bother wasting your time."
4," Yawn, zzzz
",The-Sarkologist,/user/ur27175177/,8 January 2023,"Depsite there being a few interesting aspects to this film, like a number of elements that seemed to have been borrowed from Ancient Greek mythology (namely the sirens and the winged feet), I have to admit that I found that this film was rather dull and boring. I guess one of the reasons was that Boseman's death seemed to be hanging over the entire film. Sure, one should pay tribute to him, but the problem is that I felt that it went just a little bit too far at times, and thus it really wasn't all that enjoyable.The film is basically about how the rest of the world have become rather annoyed at Wakunda because they aren't willing to share Vibranium with them, but they then discover some at the bottom of the ocean, using a machine that has been designed to detect vibranium. However, the rig is attacked and everybody on the rig is killed, and of course the people who are first accused is Wakunda. It turns out that they aren't the only ones who have access to vibranium, as the leader of a nation of undersea peoples approaches them and instructs them to find the scientist who invented the detector.Okay, ignoring the fact that a country who's economy is based on a single resource (and a resource that they don't even trade) is unlikely to become a world superpower (and of course they clearly don't want to interact with the rest of the world either), it does put things into perspective, particularly with regards to the United States. Unlike the previous film, there is more going on in the United States, and there is clearly some animosity towards Wakanda, namely because they aren't willing to play fair, at least play fair as far as the developed world is concerned.However, the main focus of the film seems to involve two empires who have vibranium coming into contact with each other, and the question iswho would win in the battle. This, mind you, results in there being a number of other plots that seem to not get resolved, or get resolved a bit too quickly, particularly the one involving the CIA agent who is eventually arrested because, well, he has got a bit too close to the Wakundans. Of course, we also have the ending, which is interesting, namely due to the suggestion that Wakunda may not actually be able to effectively integrate into the world at large.Still, in the end, I really found that this film was quite lacking, and rather boring. Some have suggested that Marvel can't do sequels, but I don't think that is the case because they have released some pretty good sequels. However, as for this one, I can't really place my finger on it, but it really didn't grab me all that much, and in part I really couldn't wait for it to end."
6," Very powerful action film.
",xianslad,/user/ur136096497/,8 January 2023,"""Black Panther Wakanda Forever"" directed by Ryan Coogler. It's an action and adventure movie. The film was outstanding because it had elements, such as the performers' excellent acting, that Shuir showed in the movie. At the film's beginning, Wakanda expresses their thoughts over how they miss ""Black Panther"" star ""Chadwick Boseman"" and Ryan Coogler utilizes the movie to memorialize him. The script, written by Joe Robert, was lengthy and exciting. This movie set was in the 2020s but used technology far more sophisticated than ours. The plot explains how Shuri transforms into the new Black Panther and teams up with other characters to defeat Namor. The actors performed well and were talented, especially Shuri, as the new Black Panther. She will have a lot of responsibility for the forthcoming movies. The music score was sad when Black Panther died at the movie's opening. The film was filled with funny moments that make you laugh, yet the most impactful parts show how important they are becoming. I had goosebumps at the end credit, which created an exciting future for Marvel. This movie is a must-see since the pivotal point in the film made me cry, and I advise you to see it."
8," An entertaining and even touching final chapter of the MCU's Phase Four
",r96sk,/user/ur49400835/,5 January 2023,"Chadwick Boseman is undeniably missed, but 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' still manages to produce an entertaining and even touching final chapter of the MCU's Phase Four.I had a positive time with this, one good thing about watching it almost two months after release is that I got to watch this in an empty cinema - absolute bliss. Thankfully I managed to avoid all spoilers, though had heard the name Namor bandied about online so that's all I knew coming into it.Speaking of Namor, I'm a fan. He makes for a cool new character to the universe, as does Talokan as a whole, with Tenoch Huerta a welcomed addition to the cast - first time I recall seeing him in something, and I'm impressed. The star of this 2022 flick, however, is Letitia Wright. I don't really remember her standing out in the original much, at least to me, but here Wright is excellent.Angela Bassett is very good also, there's one emotion-filled speech scene in particular that stands out in my memory. Danai Gurira is always a joy to watch, while Winston Duke and Lupita Nyong'o are the best of the rest - though, the whole cast are good; even Martin Freeman, who I'm not always convinced by.The film handles Boseman's absence nicely, there are some very touching moments in there. I'd say they went the correct way with the character of T'Challa, no-one would've been able to even closely replicate Boseman. The music, meanwhile, is pleasant.I do think this has some relatively minor pacing issues, mainly around the midway point, but other than that I felt more than satisified with what I had just watched when leaving the cinema. Phase Five, see you soon!"
8," Great Entertainment
",egdix,/user/ur2742361/,3 January 2023,"The task at hand of having to create a sequel without the main character had to have been daunting. Yet they pull out a miracle. Not sure how people say the acting was bad. In fact Angela Basset was tremendous. Could have cut out 15 minutes of the movie, but no complaints. Nice to see women be the badasses. Well crafted, well acted, great music and great editing. My only complaint is at the end when we find out two of the women are together. Not sure what the point was at the point in the movie. If you are going to do that (which does feel like an agenda in Marvel movies now. Way to obvious) why not introduce this earlier so that it adds more tension when they are in a fighting scene. That would have made more sense. This feels like someone made the writers add this in at the end. At this point it added nothing to the story. Add it earlier and incorporate it into the fabric of the movie.Movie should be up for some awards for sure. Last but not least, they handled the death of Black Panther appropriately."
6," Umm...
",Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,/user/ur24085266/,2 January 2023,"**Spoilers Ahead**Black Panther 2 was bound to happen give or take whatever would happen to Chadwick Boseman; it was a cynical approach to an impossibly bold undertaking to cinema's most successful black superhero and have a sequel... without the main star at all.Wakanda Forever doesn't feel like a film that's gonna be immortalised like some of Marvel's previous entries, but feels like ANOTHER film to fulfill that sweet yearly content quota for Disney. Yes the story was interesting, yes it paid homage to Chadwick well, but the film feels like an empty tribute piece that... undermines ALL of its respect with THAT twist at the ending of the movie.Long story short: T'Challa has a kid, who was willed into existence between this movie and the first Black Panther. Okay, not really, but when Chadwick was still alive, the film was gonna be a father-and-son centric story. But the way the film uses that plot strand as a tease for future movies felt like it was a well-intended homage that ended up coming off as tone-deaf 'sequel insurance' that doesn't do Boseman any posthumous service.Anyway, Black Panther 2 isn't bad, but the circumstances of THIS film and The Star Wars Sequel Trilogy after Carrie Fisher died when The Last Jedi was completed but never lived to see Episode IX done: it's a weirdly frustrating dilemma filling the void of a widely beloved, and passed, talent and pressing on with a fully completed sequel regardless. Loss of movie characters are hard, but losing the actors is SO MUCH harder; for all of us.It seems like Marvel is still trying to figure out its mojo post-Endgame, and it's gonna keep trying to find it even if a lot of this stuff seems too 'pre-determined' as escapism goes in the cinema these days.P. S. We REALLY miss you, Chadwick. Gone too soon, but never forgotten."
6," Phase 4 MCU's average movie to end an average phase
",Benjamin-M-Weilert,/user/ur100116496/,2 January 2023,"As the last film in the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) proves that there was no plan for this phase other than to clean up the remains of the Infinity War saga. To its credit, though, Wakanda Forever was burdened with finding an in-universe replacement for the titular Black Panther after the untimely passing of Chadwick Boseman. However, considering how most of Phase 4 was passing the mantle from one hero to the next generation, it fits well within this theming.There's a line in Avengers: Endgame (2019) where Naka (Lupita Nyong'o) states that Wakanda is aware of an anomaly on the ocean floor near their country and that they were handling it. This throwaway line was likely played for laughs, but it's peculiar how Wakanda was woefully unprepared for the invasion of their land by underwater enemies, even though they clearly knew about it three years ago. Phase 4 of the MCU has highlighted how difficult it is to maintain continuity in a franchise as huge as it has become.Even though Marvel has introduced new characters in movies outside their own standalone works since the early Phases, I would have liked something more dedicated to introducing Ironheart (Dominique Thorne) considering how influential Iron Man was to the MCU. I also would have appreciated action sequences that weren't so dark or hard to follow, because I can't honestly recall any of them that happened in this movie. Overall, I felt the end of the MCU Phase 4 was average-which aligns with the MCU Phase 4 as a whole. Here's to hoping the next Phase actually goes somewhere.Phase 4 MCU's average movie to end an average phase, I give Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 3.0 stars out of 5."
4," Pointless plotwise
",der_kommisar,/user/ur4972505/,2 January 2023,With the latest MCU instalments they seem to have just given up on the concept of writing a good plot.What was the point of this movie?A merman born under water sees some random people enslave other random people. Based on this he decides that all surface people must die. Excact copy of the All Gods Must Die plot of Thor Love and Thunder.The subplot of killing the scientists makes no sense whatsoever and is quickly forgotten.The villain and his water realm was entirely boring and pointless.The Wakandans are the most advanced and powerful nation but cannot defend their capital against an attack from ten mermen and leave their queen undefended.Later they take the fight to the enemy and lose again.Martin Freeman has a short pointless role.The CGI backdrops look fake - shiny and unreal like a film from ten years ago.The underwater stuff looks muddy and CGIish compared to Avatar the Way of Water.The actors are mostly good especially the many female but the direction is awful. All drama is turned up to eleven with wailing and screaming.The princes show a few deeper layers with more subtle emotions.After two and a half long hours we finally get to see her in the BP suit. She has one short fight which she loses but then overcomes.A couple of predictable trails to film three is revealed at the end.For me one of the weakest of the MCUs.
6," Okoye for Black Panther - Rating 6.5
",robinson-24624,/user/ur69856916/,1 January 2023,"The movie was good in the beginning with the heartfelt tribute to Chadwick/T'Challa and solid performance from Angela Basset throughout but lost me in the end for several reasons.1. I may be one of the few people that feel this way but Okoye would have made a more believable and exciting Black Panther. I know that Shuri became the Black Panther at some point in the comics but sometimes it's okay to do an original take on the story and keep things fresh. Okoye's fight scene on the bridge was the best action scene of the movie. PERIOD. Why not build on that?! She is one of the best fighters around the MCU and proved it continually in multiple movies. I need to see the Black Panther do more than just back flips and shoot blasters which is all Shuri did in the suit. I just kept waiting for a moment of everyone realizing that Okoye was truly the best all-around choice to take over the mantle but was majorly disappointed when that never happened which is the main reason I give this movie 2-3 points lower than I would have.2. Couldn't someone look at the Midnight Angel's outfits and think, ""eh- maybe we should scrap that idea"". It's hard for me to accept a bulky look like that which seemed to have more flare than function after watching the evolution of the Iron Man suits and the Black Panther suits.3. I liked the introduction of Riri in this movie but would have preferred they save her creation and use of the Iron Heart suits for the Disney+ show. One of the best parts of the first Iron Man was watching the trial and error of Tony building his suits in the cave and his basement. It also built the emotional connection between the character, the suit and the audience. The way they quickly jammed her putting on the 2 different versions of the suit into the overall Black Panther 2 plot made me care less about everything when she was in it. Hoping it is a sleeker version and they show more details behind the development of it in the Disney+ show.4. Final fight scene was lackluster. This is due to all 3 reasons above plus many more that would take me a while to get into but you can easily find on other reviews.Overall, this was an enjoyable movie that had the potential to be as great as the first Black Panther or Winter Soldier but fell short."

",anthonypazzano,/user/ur160403751/,31 December 2022,"With the way Marvel was going with Thor Love and Thunder (awful movie), I was worried about this sequel to Black Panther. Especially with how they would push the story now that Chadwick Boseman has passed (RIP legend).Boy... was I ever wrong there. This was one of those Marvel movies and sequels that was paced so well, time just flew by and I totally forgot I sat on my ass for a full 2hr 45min. Those are the best Marvel movies really - the ones where you don't think about going on a bathroom break even once.Not gonna spoil anything here, just see it if you liked the first one! I really hope the next Marvel phase has more movies/sequels like this, and fewer like the last Thor movie."
9," Signs that Marvel movies are starting to get serious
",gcsman,/user/ur66541531/,31 December 2022,"Almost against my will, I went away liking ""Wakanda Forever"" more than the first Black Panther. It's long (2:45) and it does have a couple of sub-plots that don't do much except use up screen time (see below), but there's lots here that's really good. Most of all, this one is showing definite signs that the MCU is maturing into handling serious stuff in a way that is getting closer to mainstream, good movies. The pace is relaxed, the obligatory action sequences don't go on endlessly, and there is actual dialog and characterization that are given enough time to breathe.In other words, maybe the MCU is growing up. I think there were already good signs that this was coming in Shang-Chi (2021) and in Spider-Man No Way Home (2021), to be fair. These movies and Wakanda Forever have a richness of texture and a deliberate pace that I really liked.Probably the reasons for this are clear enough. Their main Black Panther star, Chadwick Boseman, sadly is now gone, so they had to decide how to work around it. As we see on screen, they confronted it head-on: T'Challa is said to have died of an unspecified illness and now the rest of the kingdom has to move on. For the storyline, this turns out to free up a whole lot of space for the other main characters (Shuri, Nakia, Okoye, Raimonda, M'Baku) to work, and they do a great job. It's like we're meeting them for the first time. They were all there in the first Black Panther, but of course they were all playing second fiddle for the Big Guy.Which leads me to say that because of all this, Wakanda Forever is now just the second (or maybe third at a stretch) female-led MCU movie! (and Black women at that). To some extent it's an ensemble piece, but ultimately this is Letitia Wright's movie to make or break, and as Shuri she continues to be excellent.The side plot with agent Ross (Martin Freeman) was sort of a fun distraction but seemed to be entirely disposable, frankly. Same for the young Riri Williams (Dominque Thorne), who seems to be brought in just to fill in the blank of ""which new character shall we introduce this time?"" But it was an interesting choice to make the main 'villains', Namor and his people (he's actually one of the very oldest Marvel comics characters), into Mayan-ancestry figures, and I guess it works about as well as any other option. True to form, all MCU antagonists are given extensive backstories, and Namor is important enough to get an even bigger than average treatment. Still, the pairing of Wakanda and the submarine Talokan is really an odd one. In places it just doesn't quite work.Enough. If you haven't seen it, ignore the reviews that say it's 'slow' or 'too dialogy' and go take it in. Maybe Marvel really is moving on from Avengers-style wall-to-wall action."
8," Best of Phase 4
",ThereelscoopwithKK,/user/ur153803309/,29 December 2022,"If any sequel in phase 4 had an excuse to flop it was this one and yet it might have been the only one that exceeded my expectations. Filling the shoes of Chadwick Boseman is pretty impossible. The secondary actors and actresses stepped up pretty well here in my opinion to deliver a story that had my interest throughout.One of the best parts I thought was how the action scenes were more creative than what Marvel has been delivering as of late. The violent scenes were also used appropriately instead of just fighting for fighting sake which is often the case in many others.The villain wasn't super flashy or charismatic but I think he worked very well for this story. He has some unique skills and isn't a prototypical villain. It will be interesting to see how they use him in the future.The mid credit scene certainly opens up future storyline options and there's a couple different ways it could go. This may also be the movies weakness in that although it had sort of a forced reset with the tragic death of Boseman , this movie did not definitively set a course for where the Black Panther franchise is headed.A solid conclusion to phase 4, but I really hope phase 5 is much better."
8," Miles better than the first movie
",jon_anderson77,/user/ur32123996/,29 December 2022,Look this was always going to be a difficult sequel. Losing your lead actor in such a significant role will damage the story however this movie is leagues above the first movie in terms of action. People are saying this movie is boring clearly don't remember the drama laden movie that came before it. Not that it was a bad thing but to say this is boring in comparison simply isn't true. The set pieces are far superior and the story is much more layered. My only criticisms are the submariners reminder me of the Navi in Avatar and as always it was way too long. Stop making bloated 2.5 hour movies. We don't want them.
8," Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022, Ryan Coogler) A tall order replacing Boseman, but this film does as well as it can
",hoernkeem,/user/ur44376731/,29 December 2022,"2018's 'Black Panther' was not only only a creative and financial success for all those involved, but it was a cultural revelation and a touchstone for those in the black community who finally had a positive high profile hero who became a rallying point to galvanize a community. 'Black Panther' was far from a niche success though as part of the MCU it garnered mass appeal around the world and across cultures, and much of that success was due to the undeniable charisma of star Chadwick Boseman who didn't just star as King T'Challa, he was T'Challa. A sequel was a no brainer and everyone was quickly regathered and work commenced, however, everything changed with the sudden and tragic death of Boseman from stomach cancer. Many questions surrounded the status of the now in flux film. Ultimately it was decided T'Challa would not be recast and instead 'Wakanda Forever' finds friends and family dealing with his untimely passing just as they had to do in real life. Ryan Coogler once again takes the directorial reins from a script he co-wrote along with Joe Robert Cole. All of the Wakanda regulars return in this sequel with the primary focus shifting to Shuri, T'Challa's sister, played by Letitia Wright.Outside of dealing with T'Challa's death and the passing of the Black Panther mantle the other main focus here is on the discovery of a water breathing race of super beings headed by super powered submariner Namor, played by Tenoch Huerta. This revelation brings another long standing Marvel character to the silver screen. The world wants vibranium and if they cannot take it by force from Wakanda they will attempt to seek it out with a newly developed machine that detects it. The inventor of the machine winds up being Riri Williams, a brilliant African American teen who is an MIT student, and while they never reference her by name in the comics she builds her own Iron Man suit and goes by the moniker Iron Heart. Turns out the long hidden underwater Talokan has a wealth of vibranium, and in order to keep it secret Namor is attempting to seek out Riri Williams and kill her. Wakanda decides to aid her and this puts the two powers at odds. Eventually Shuri discovers a way to reproduce the ""heart shaped herb"", destroyed in the previous film by Killmonger, which allows her to gain powers and don the mantle of Black Panther as the two nations do battle. In the end a tenuous peace is reached and it is intimated that they may have to work together in the future as the world comes for their vibranium.It is an extremely challenging thing to move on from Chadwick Boseman especially with this property as he looms so incredibly larger than life and well he should. I think Coogler and the entire cast do an admirable job of crafting a story that functions well as the next chapter in Wakanda's tale while also honoring the legacy of T'Challa and Boseman himself. The story flows well, and the action is first rate and Shuri does a good job taking over as Black Panther. One of the problems with 'Black Panther' was how much action occurred in the dark making some sequences very hard to see and follow, and those flaws are all fixed here with excellent action sequences throughout. I was not in love with the new suits that that some of the Dora Milaje are sporting. I do love that they don't just try to make Shuri a female T'Challa. She is very much her own thing and governed quite a bit by the hurt and loss she has experienced due to T'Challa's passing combined with her own guilt at not being able to save him. Other experiences in the film fuel that as well, but she shoulders all that burden and comes through as a legitimate heir to the Black Panther mantle as well as leadership of a nation. Huerta is excellent as Namor, and while I do not know much about Namor I get the impression he is a lot like this in the comics which is not quite a villain, but not exactly a hero either. Dominique Thorn also excelled as Williams who we should be seeing more of in the MCU. Really the whole cast, many of whom return from the first film, do a wonderful job. This film had a monumental challenge and I believe all involved did the best they could and while this may never live up to the cultural touchstone that 'Black Panther' was it certainly does a wonderful job of moving the story of Black Panther and Wakanda and the MCU forward.Eric's Grade: B+"
10," This movie is the greatest movie put out in 2022
",poselily,/user/ur160476869/,27 December 2022,"I said what I said, no other movie can compare. The soundtrack, the acting, the plotline, everything was just amazing. It doesn't deserve the hate it's getting. It also doesn't deserve the hype it's getting. It deserves WAYYY more attention and hype bruh, this was fire. You actually have to be crazy if you can watch this movie and say it wasn't good. Letitia Wright and Angela Basset ate on this movie, same with Lupita. Everybody just did amazingly, especially Burna Boy, Rihanna and Tems. I love how they kept the representation of culture, adding afrobeats and portraying poc cultures perfectly. Marvel ate with this."
2," Bad writing
",joshisn-97319,/user/ur160443280/,27 December 2022,"In today's world where a new action movie and series comes out every month you have to do better than just good vfx. The story writing was sloppy and painful to watch. They had great cast, good characters yet they failed to make a good movie. The whole time Wakanda royals were either doing battle cries or shouting at people rather than coming up with strategy to protect their nation. There were many points where they could have done the conflict resolution with words. The opposing nation reached out to Wakanda twice and WARNED them. Also why not explore Talukan technology? Except the water grandes they did not have as good weapons as Wakanda. So were they really powerful as they claimed in the movie? That's why the win wakanda had against the Talukam seemed like adult winning against a kid."
6," nice enough but not good enough
",killercharm,/user/ur97978800/,26 December 2022,"This is a Marvel comic book adaptation, a superhero flick. It's beautiful with loving attention to detail, and heavy on the hamming. All the lore and Wakanda worship gets a tad tedious and the redundant superhero fighting can bore me out the room for a tick, but the city and its inhabitants are a joy to watch. Wakanda revels in its monopoly on vibranium, sharing nothing with anyone. Then, out of the blue, literally, a different nation-state is found out to be holding. Apparently something happens when you hold vibranium stocks because Roman, I mean Namor, the leader of the new player, Talokan, his underwater world, wants to kill everyone if that's what it takes to keep his city, people and powers secret. It's a nice enough movie."
6," Exciting visuals, the main element is sadly missing.
",andrewdyer1,/user/ur160411392/,26 December 2022,"Wakanda Forever was a film I approached with a degree of caution, simply because of the missing element, Chadwick Boseman, who's gargantuan efforts in the first film have changed my opinion of that film, from initial disappointment, to a healthy respect and admiration. Wakanda Forever is just missing something, a driving force, and despite Leticia Wright and Angela Bassett both nailing it, something is missing. The actual plot is the big disappointment, it was hard to swallow that another race could have existed for so long, yet remain unknown, it was maybe too dialog laden as well. Sometimes you're just aware of a movie's running time.Watched 12.08.22."
1," Way over-rated
",sky_wox,/user/ur26152953/,25 December 2022,"No name actors with extremely poor acting skills. The action is sporadic at best and the CGI is limited. They do too much of talking about the ex actor and focus less on the actual new path of the ""country"". They do want include some other civilizations... but all they manage is to copy the Avatar idea. Extremely disappointing to see such lack of innovation, but then again, with such a low grade writer and director. The only people who actually might deserve their pay are the ones from the CGI department. However, the low budget they were given is clearly seen in their work outcome. Anyway... for 8 bucks to see a 2 h story about ""colonization""... let's see is better than staying home."
8," Imperfect, but Still Highly Effective in Execution
",bagainsboro16-982-565177,/user/ur52258235/,25 December 2022,"First off, I feel it necessary to give Ryan Coogler and the entire production team working on Black Panther: Wakanda Forever a nod of credit. I believe - and you can tell quite early on in the film - that five years ago, this is not the movie Coogler and his team thought they would be crafting.Improvising on the fly to overcome a real-life tragedy (RIP the immortal Mr. Boseman), I thought the entire film was quite well done. Acting-wise, we saw Letitia Wright (as Shuri) go from sidekick standout to full-blown star. She handled the emotional scenes well, clearly understood her character's conflicting emotions, and proved, at least to me, that she is fully capable of carrying the massive weight of a blockbuster film like this one.Moreover, Angela Bassett flexes her acting chops with a far more nuanced yet charged performance as Queen Ramonda. It was great to see her character get additional time to shine in the sequel. As always, Lupita Nyong'o (as Nakia), Winston Duke (as M'Baku), and Danai Gurira (as Okoye) all thrive in their respective roles.One lowlight? While Martin Freeman was endearing and engaging in the original Black Panther, I found his presence in this film wholly unnecessary and often played for cheap (and ineffective) laughs.Lastly, while Tenoch Huerta's turn as Namor comes with sometimes questionable motives, I found his screen presence and visuals to be captivating. The film set up more Namor in the future, and that is a character I cannot wait to see make his return in some capacity.Visually, the film is stunning. From the vibrant underwater world of Talokan to the ever-vivacious streets of Wakanda, I thought the film thrived when focusing on these specific set-pieces. Elsewhere, I thought, at times, the film was (quite simply), a little too dark. While dark spots in MCU films have worked in the past, I felt that some of these low-light scenes took away from the engagement. Wright, Bassett, and Huerta are all gifted actors when it comes to facial expressions, and the lighting choices sometimes made it difficult to be fully immersed.Story-wise, I've seen a few reviews so far that have questioned the character's motives. I agree, to an extent, and the pacing of the film is highly flawed. There were a couple of scenes in which I thought the character's deserved more time to converse, and then Coogler decided to rapidly jump to another less engaging plot point. Moreover, the climax of the movie is greatly flawed (as often happens with MCU films). The narrative is there, and the arc works, but the timing/pacing was not always aligned.Overall, I greatly enjoyed this MCU romp. In my opinion, it was greatly more engaging than Doctor Strange 2 and Thor: Love and Thunder. While I'm not quite ready to put it on the same pedestal as the extraordinarily thrilling Spider-Man: No Way Home, I thought it compared nicely to Shang Chi.If you are an MCU fan, this is a must-watch."
8," A worthy sequel for the namesake character
",benjaminwest-242,/user/ur122400466/,25 December 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a very entertaining and emotionally satisfactory watch, serving as a highlight to Phase 4. Most important to the film's success is its dignified remembrance of Chadwick Boseman and his wonderful portrayal as the Black Panther. Beyond a fantastically emotional first act setup, though, the film is undeniably full of intriguing characters and events. Almost every character holds the audience's undivided attention, especially those of Ramonda and Shuri. As the respective mother and sister of the Black Panther, each character's dialogue is excellently written. This is taken to another level with the great performances by Bassett and Wright. Supporting Wakandan characters such as Okoye, Nakia, and M'Baku are additionally compelling and blessed with genuine portrayals by their respective cast members. Huerta's Namor adds another respectable villain to the MCU, as well. His motivations, while simple, are entirely justified. What makes this antagonist so intriguing, though, is the means by which he and his people achieve their goals. This ultimately leads to a third act, and resolution, that feels epic and earned. Wakanda Forever absolutely excels on a technical level, too. The sound is amazing, the score and soundtrack kick in at the exact right times, and a like to its predecessor, costume design is a near shoe in for an Oscar nomination. This all being said, the picture is not perfect. While technically proficient on the whole, some weak moments of CGI are certainly present and the editing has just as many shaky sequences. This is mostly attributable during the action that, while atmospheric, would have been more enjoyable with less cuts. There is additionally one too many characters within, which leads to a somewhat dull introduction of the Ironheart character. The character likely just doesn't quite fit with the emotional tone the picture was going for, which ends up warping the character arc into feeling rushed. The overall screenplay is not flawless, either, between a few scripted-feeling moments and points of blatant exposition. Nonetheless, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a must watch for any fan of the MCU or the Black Panther franchise."
," What a waste
",jojunno,/user/ur6848692/,25 December 2022,To the surprise of no one because Marvel post Endgame has been nothing but colossal disappointment after poorly written colossal disappointment. This is a prime example of what happens when you worry about virtue signaling and paying tribute to a fallen legend more than telling a good story. To call this waste poorly paced is under selling it. Add terrible casting (N'Moor not Namor) and a nonsensical plot and what results is one of the worst comic book movies certainly one of the worst sequels Marvel has ever constructed. Besides a money grab there's absolutely no reason to continue this franchise. And I think real fans are in agreement. The MCU is cancer and the future looks glum.
4," A Fitting End To Phase 4
",thechair,/user/ur9874833/,24 December 2022,"What a load of boring rubbish. It was obvious that Marvel was going to struggles after the twin brilliance of Infinity War (especially) and Endgame, and struggle they have, releasing a mish mash of the poor, the ill-conceived and the downright hateable (hello, Thor).Wakanda Forever feels a fitting end to the run, delivering boredom, poor cinematography, eye-rolling silliness and a lack of gravity in equal measure. Oh, and it is way, way, way too long. In truth it would probably have been a passable 6/10 if it was two hours; something to catch and then quickly forget ever existed. At two hours-forty it is actually painful. I couldn't have cared less what happens to any of the characters by the end. Letitia Wright can act but she absolutely does not have the chops to carry a movie like this. Any scene at night was so dim I could barely make out what was going on. Namor and his underwater kingdom? Meh. It was pants. A waste of time.I'm done with Marvel now. Adios, and thanks for the good times."
8," Great tribute; entertaining movie
",qkpzvf,/user/ur160296531/,23 December 2022,"I'll just come right out and say it, I truly enjoyed this movie. Now, I'm not exactly the type to go see a movie based on its ""film-quality,"" I'm more of a ""was it entertaining?"" kind of gal. For me, this movie was very entertaining.It addresses loss and grief in such a real way that it was easy to empathize with T'Challa's family. It was also a touching tribute to Chadwick Boseman.The storyline seemed a little fractured, but I think people have to remember that when the first phase of the MCU started coming out there were a lot of things that didn't make sense either. They only make sense now that you've seen all of the movies and have gone back to watch them again.Don't get me wrong, this isn't the best film in the MCU or even in phase four, but it's still a good movie. Marvel set the bar very high for its fans with Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, so I think it will just take time for viewers to readjust expectations and for the creators to adjust their views as well. They need time to take a step back and stop trying to outdo the final two Avengers films and get back to just making good, cohesive movies."
10," Black Panther, Colonized Gaze
",TokyoGyaru,/user/ur24831693/,23 December 2022,"I'd love to gush about this film that I saw eleven times in the theater (everyone did well, but my goodness, Angela and Letitia were just...amazing), but there is something that's sat on my mind for a while. I mention the number of times I've seen it to say I've seen it enough to form an opinion of it. Secondly, I'd suggest anyone watch the film at least twice. Why? Because the first time you see it, you're going to have baggage going into it. I've done my best to try to avoid the hatred directed at this film for merely existing, but it does seep in. And whenever a minority or women or (goodness forbid) minority women do anything, the hateful are going to misuse the slang usage of the word ""woke."" Black folks came up with that term (as slang) to say to stay ""awake"" (i.e., keep your eyes open to what goes on in the world); however, certain people use it to mean ""minorities are there and aren't in service."" You know what I mean.Now, to get more to the point. The title of my review is because a lot of people (including some confused black people) have been using a far-white lens to look at this film. However, black people know good and well that black women have always (and I mean always) led families in the absence of men, whether it was because they passed away, were locked up, or simply left. And that goes for on the continent as well. There have been female warrior queens in African history, but what does the U. S. or any colonist country know or care about that? What do their descendants know about it? Nothing. Point is, it is not unusual, even in the world of this fictional franchise (because a woman has been the Black Panther before, as was Shuri in the comics) for black women to lead anything. I hate to bring up statistics because they're so often used as a weapon but need to do so to make a point, but just over ten years ago, 72% of black babies were born to unwed mothers. Goodness knows what the statistic is for 2022. You have black male celebrities like Nick Cannon, Future, and several others having children they don't intend to fully parent by several different women. But some of y'all are mad that the film features black women in leadership roles? It's a reflection of life whether you accept it or not, and even though two black men wrote the script, you still don't want to accept it. There are no ""girl power"" or ""in spite of being a girl/woman"" moments because womanism (not feminism) doesn't work like that. Like, at all.Something I like that Letitia pointed out in an interview is that they don't make some big, showy deal about women doing anything. And that's true. It's not a ""fxminist film,"" and if you think so, that's because you're looking at it through a far-white gaze. It is unusual to them for their women to lead in such ways, to be the military leaders, top spies, the whole of the king's guard, etc. And the tone of their films about women leading things tends to be ""girl boss,"" abrasive, and emasculating. However, Wakanda shows what real equality between men and women would look like. Not someone humbling someone based on their gender but disagreeing based on opinions and policy and adherence to non-gender-based traditions.But in Africa, that's not as strange and ""empowering"" as you think it is. It's just a thing. I almost feel sorry for any black folks that have a colonized mind to dare to look at this film in that way. There is rising far-rxght sentiment in young black men, and they turn to black women to blame for the fathers who weren't there. And so they hate this film that literally worships Chadwick and his memory while they are using the memory of a good man as a weapon to attack black women and whomever else. I might not have known Chadwick personally, but I watched every single interview I could about the film and listened to his FRIENDS/FAMILY talk about him. I wish I could have known him -- he sounds so cool and interesting and smart and kind! It still hurts that he's gone (I literally still cry) because I wish I could have known him personally. He was studious, curious, selfless, and LOVED his co-stars like family and they him. If they'd recast him (which they technically do anyway), would we have gotten the outpouring of love on screen that we did? The movie was about him and how his passing affected everyone, even the Talocanil! (Also, Shuri was his favorite character, btw.)So, as a kind of TL; DR: This film shows love to an actor (i.e., Chadwick) in a way I've never seen a film do before. Never before have I seen a giant corporation spend hundreds of millions of dollars to dedicate this much to the memory of an actor. If you can't see that, if all you could see is women-this and black-that, then you're missing out on so much. As I said, I saw it eleven freaking times in the theater. While it's not perfect, there's so much love put into it and such a powerful message about confronting and processing grief. Also, it DID ""recast"" T'Challa by giving us his son (of the same name) AND possibly M'Baku as the new king of Wakanda. If you watched in hate, even if you think you didn't, I think you did because the film, like the first one, humanizes black people and doesn't center whiteness, and you're simply unused to that. But at the end of the day, it's a HUMAN story, whether you see black folks as human or not.S/N: Anyone who didn't see the greatness in M'Baku's role really missed out. He earned that kingship (if it truly is to be his) by being level-headed, empathetic, brave, self-less, and a sound source of council. Two of my favorite scenes/dialogues in the film involve him and Shuri. I loved M'Baku's character in this film! Also, I loved the interpretation of N'amor (kind of not ""Namor"" anymore) and his motivations. He was fully fleshed out and his concerns were understandable. Great job by Tenoch, Mabel, and Alex. This film has my favorite ensemble cast (with Chadwick there in spirit) of all time!"
8," Not your typical superhero movie
",gpapakyprianos,/user/ur62977439/,22 December 2022,"Black Panther Wakanda forever not only had to compete with a very strong origin movie, but it also had to honor one of the greatest Hollywood icon, Chadwick Boseman. Even though the film succeeded in honoring the beloved actor, in a very emotional way, it found itself in great distance from its comic and superhero vibe. The movie managed to become ,early on, a political drama with the main focus a war on resources. Then comes Namor. A villain to remember, constantly fighting to preserve the history and the great gift of his ancestors and the safety of his people. Leaving the theater, Black panther 2, left me enthusiastic, yet not amazed."
7," (SPOILER FREE) No too bad. Better than I expected
",tronnyg,/user/ur132864516/,22 December 2022,"While I have never been a fan of implementing political things in movies. This movie does a somewhat decent job of implementing it into the story. While it was still quite noticeable, it was much better done than other films. Given how bad the rest of phase 4 marvel films where this surprised me and was fairly enjoyable.Just ignore all of the reviews, politics and expectations and watch it with an open mind. While I do think there are definitely many aspects that could have been written better, especially the ending fight, it was fun, action packed, fairly enjoyable and had a lot of good concepts written in the story. Certain characters were slightly neglected as the focus was on the main character. The plot was quite good but had holes and some parts felt a bit forced. Overall It had much more substance than the recent marvel films, but also lacked the depth of a great film."
10," Magical movie
",cherrycharity-23234,/user/ur160257716/,22 December 2022,"This is a must-see movie. I have never shed tears in a theater, but at the end of this celestial movie I did drop a few tears, then had waterworks the drive home. The losses that Shuri had to endure and the control she took over the losses to mature and become the Black Panther was simply excellent and perfect for her character. One actress and one job, and the job was filled perfectly. This is a movie that I would have my memory wiped to see it again for the first time. The directors ensured that each death was not meaningless - even the death Killmonger, which was years ago in the first movie was met with great importance. This movie was a cinematic masterpiece, and should be on everyone's bucket-list."
3," Not a theater worthy flick.
",jkoesehfuear,/user/ur40284050/,21 December 2022,"This movie started off pretty good, but immediately goes off the rails. The funeral scene was very understated for a head of state dying. Especially in contrast to other ceremonies that exist in the wakanda universe. The character of Shuri is insufferable. Never have I rooted for a ""good"" character to die as often as I did for her. They struck out on the casting on Namor. He was terrible. They did awesome with Iron Heart. She was one of the few good moments in the movie. Other than a few emotional scenes, everything else falls flat. The choice for the new Black Panther was terrible. Killing off certain characters was terrible. The end credit scene does bring hope for the future of the franchise though. Black Panther 1 was amazing, Wakanda Forever was terrible."
6," Serves it's purpose...
",DarthValorem,/user/ur127267925/,21 December 2022,"This movie is not an ordinary marvel movie, set to tell an ordinary story. The roots of the movie lies behind the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman. This is a tribute and it serves it's purpose...The movie doesn't promise you an original, creative or a complex storyline as it is basically not what it's going for. This move, excluding the Chadwick Boseman tribute parts, is very dull. Like a whole movie of a filler episode. But let me tell you it is, quite acceptable as the movie isn't trying hard to shine on such qualities in it's storytelling.The movie begins with an exceptional tribute for Chadwick Boseman, leaving every seat in the theater with at least mildly teared up eyes. What I personally felt as I was watching the movie and see the marvel fanfare flow through my eyes, was the fact that this person, non fictional person, played a part in my life. I remember going to Infinity War in 2018, to Endgame a year later. With the scenes flowing on the big screen, I acknowledge that Chadwick's art has had an impact in my life. Therefore he had a place in my life. These thoughts made tribute even more impactfull for me and I can tell you that the tribute is quite dignified and sober. So go in there with no expectations, but just memories of the late Black Panther, Chadwick Boseman.I don't think that the other parts of the movie is worth reviewing or discussing as the current state of the MCU is lame. The rest of the movie is fun, could be classified as an ordinary action film with some emotional spikes. So watching this as a standalone tribute would be the wisest thing you can do."
5," The loss of Chadwick Boseman has never been greater
",geislekm,/user/ur14658873/,21 December 2022,"This movie had been out for a month before I saw it, so I had seen many reviews that indicated this movie underwhelms, and so I set my expectations accordingly; and I was still disappointed. Letitia Wright is a decent actress, but a leading lady she is not. Full disclosure, during the pandemic she came out as an anti-vaxer and I'll be honest, that fear and distrust of science made her absolutely unbelievable as a genius scientist, and her acting skills are insufficient to overcome that fact.Adding to the lack of a strong leading actor is the fact that the plot was pretty thin. An undersea city attacks Wakanda and kills their queen, and then expects Wakanda to ally themselves with the attacker? That is a tactic guaranteed to NOT create an alliance. Also, has no one in these places heard of bullets? Very effective at stopping people from slowly climbing onto ships."
8," Pretty long, but packed with a little bit of everything
",kevinbatek-30406,/user/ur151113840/,20 December 2022,"Phase 4 of the MCU has finished, with an emotional, action packed, and dramatic movie: Black Panther Wakanda Forever!With Chadwick Boseman dead, Tchalla is officially dead as well. All of Wakanda is struggling at the highest level to move forward in the wake of his passing, and struggling to protect their precious city from a new uprising tribe of people: the underwater kingdom of Talokan, led by Namor, ""The Feather Serpent God"".With 2:41:00 on the timer for this movie, and with built in movie intermissions a thing of the past, I'd highly suggest making your own intermissions when this movie leaves the theatres and comes to home media; I think I almost fell asleep at some points, but just managed to stay awake for it all! Phew! I was also able to follow along very well. All the chemistry between each of the main Wakandan's was very enjoyable, and the acting was splendid to see. I especially loved the performances of both Angela Bassett and Tenoch Huerta Mejia. Angela had such excellent lines to speak, and for my first time seeing Tenoch on screen, he did pretty good as Namor. Namor has a mysterious, mixed up personality, partially antiheroic, partially warm and welcoming; these personality traits seem to shift around whenever he doesn't have his way with things. It's amazing and surprising at how a little misunderstanding like the one presented here, can put Namor's people, and the Wakandan's at great odds with one another. Especially conflicted with everything that is happening is Shuri; with reality caving in on her, her own beliefs slowly being torn apart by Namor's stubborn demeanor, and with more and more of her closest loved ones sliding out of her life, we can see, with our breaths being held, that she is starting to lose hope...
With amazing action, tremendous performances, emotional weight, and a surprising, hopeful, and exciting twist ending in the mid-credit scene, Black Panther Wakanda Forever gives Phase 4 of the MCU a great and satisfying finish! Although other parts of Phase 4 slid downhill a little this time, I'm still cheering the creative staff of Marvel Studios on and telepathically sending my hope and praise to them, knowing that Phase 5 will be a brand new beginning, as we continue exploration of the bizarre and curious Multiverse (starting with Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania)!"

6," Where is marvel going
",ha77y73ad97,/user/ur64707141/,19 December 2022,"As many i loved everything that was released by marvel up to and including Endgame. Since then i cant say the same. This is not to say that they didnt handle the death of Chadwick Boseman well. Thats honestly the only redeeming factor in this whole story.The journey that the story took before even the credits rolled and just shows the range that Letitia Wright has, was totally shown in those first 10 minutes. For the rest these were performances that just seemed that they were taking the cash and running. I cant enjoy a film like this. The only other actor like this was Winston Duke who yet again a fun addition to a very bland filmStory, well its just the same as aquaman but from the opposite point of view! The Oceans were the bad guys and the land were the good guys who didnt have a quick treasure hunt half way through. The whole film was just setting up another story and im slowly losing interest in the MCU if they keep putting these types of stories out.I cant wait to see if they can produce any good stories going forward since maybe 2 or 3 stories have been good in the latest phase of the MCU."
8," A Cinematic Adventure
",isaacjobt,/user/ur160011685/,19 December 2022,"It's a really great film, the visuals were spectacular, especially the scenes of the city of Talokan.The weakest part of the film, was Namor's need for war with the Surface world, I think the motive was good but for him to reach to that conclusion it didn't seem right for a guy who has lived for centuries, and wants to protect his people.For someone who knew the horrors of war, he must have known that it was not a good solution for protecting his people especially fighting a war that may possibly include superhumans, sorcerers and gods or aliens who might be in the surface world.And even if Namor didn't know about superpowered humans and gods and aliens on the surface world, that would mean an even greater risk of going to war without enough information about your enemies."
6," A Boring Waste Of Time As Its A Lousy Storyline That Had No Depth To It Whatsoever!
",silicontourist,/user/ur84677252/,18 December 2022,"The only reason this is scoring a five from me is because of the good CGI, magnificent costumes and wonderful scene shots. Sadly none of that could save this terrible story which the director made it look like he was clueless as what to do with it. Not his fault really as it was woefully lacking in worth, tension, excitement, interest or quality in any way. My personal thoughts as I sat watching it (fighting hard with myself not to just switch it off) was that if they had no creative outstanding story for a sequel then Hollywood should have stopped just trying to cash in on what they thought would be a successful film franchise; whereas instead they made one of the most disappointing rubbish sequels of a film.They spoilt the memory of a great Black Panther and this will most likely do so bad at the box office that there may not be a third film being made in the future. Its the typical cash in if you can, from people involved in the putting together of the fans heroes, from directors and studios who don't give a toss about the Marvel/DC heroes and heroines; they are there too see if they can amass better wages and high end film contracts.In straight forward simplistic words, ""This was a bloody disgrace and only did damage to a superhero that has never had enough exposure!"

7," Marvel's emotional meta-eulogy to the late Chadwick Boseman that also sets up future Marvel shows on DisneyPlus
",ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,/user/ur77520024/,18 December 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, at its heart, is a meditative film about loss and grief that acts as a meta-eulogy for late actor Chadwick Boseman.Writer-director Ryan Coogler fully commits to the premise and directs in full cinematic glory, energizing this sequel with brightly-paletted cinematography, elaborate costume designs, an awesome soulful soundtrack, and a standout performance from Angela Bassett.Unfortunately, Wakanda Forever runs overlong from being jam-packed with too many side characters in subplots doing the contractually-obligated setup of future films. The franchise obligations end up muddling the sincerity of what Ryan Coogler is artfully saying.The unexpected passing of T'Challa leaves Wakanda vulnerable as other nations are pressuring them to share vibranium. As Wakanda mourns, Queen Ramonda, Shuri, and Nakia fight to protect their nation at the arrival of the Talokan, an ancient Mayan underwater nation, led by Namor.""Everybody mourns in their own way"" was a recurring thought I had throughout Wakanda Forever. This film was how the Marvel producers chose to mourn Chadwick Boseman's passing.There's magic in Ryan Coogler's films that has the audience always rooting for his protagonists. Whether it is Creed or Black Panther, Coogler viscerally pulls you into his heroes as the underdog in every frame, and the whole world is against them. For this reason, out of the solo Marvel movies, the Black Panther movies are consistently the most emotional to sit through. Coogler earnestly carries the themes of grief and loss from beginning to end, giving a solid emotional through line that anchors the film.With her towering air of regality, Angela Bassett commands the screen and carries the film on her shoulders. When the first X-Men film was announced in the 90s, the first fan casting I made in my head was Angela Bassett as Storm. It's easy to picture her god-like, possessed, and summoning lightning from the sky. Bassett naturally carries power and that is on full display as Queen Ramonda.When it came time for Letitia Wright's Shuri to carry the film, she came up short of matching Angela Bassett's dramatic weight. It's not for lack of trying as Wright gives a good performance. I can't put my finger on whether it's the lack of pathos or Letitia Wright herself or the fact that there's an undeniable vacuum at the film's center, but the Shuri character works better as a supporting character.Tenoch Huerta MejÃ­a's Namor was an intriguing antagonist that deserved more time devoted to development. Danai Gurira's Okoye is short-changed from having to wear an unfortunate costume.I didn't care for the Ironheart stuff. There's a kid character that is in line to replace every major Marvel hero now, most likely for building a future Avengers roster. I suspect I'll stop caring the day that transition happens.Admittedly, I was for Marvel recasting the Black Panther role. A person's life is infinitely more than the part they play in a superhero movie. The power was in the producers' hands and despite how unfathomable they say it was, they could have recast and instrumentally make it less of a deal. Even Chadwick Boseman's brother reportedly said Chadwick would have wanted T'Challa's story to continue.I can't help but imagine an alternate universe where Kevin Feige recasted the T'Challa part and the Black Panther story went to new places and perhaps an emotional silent title card for Chadwick Boseman in the credits.In a film predominantly occupied with mourning its lead actor, setting up an upcoming TV show on DisneyPlus just undercuts the sincerity of its tribute. It's such an odd way to mourn someone's memory. But that's just me.The heart of the film, or the eulogy, is all in the soundtrack, featuring Rihanna, Nigerian singer Tems, Fireboy DML, and many other African musical artists. The African-themed playlist is a dynamic, soulful search for meaning after loss. Some songs are crying, some are mourning, and other tracks are celebrations of life.The soundtrack made me want to dance; something I do not ever do. In my theater, two kids got up in the aisle and danced over the end credits-better them than me."
10," Wakanda Forever!!!!
",darylturner628,/user/ur42137569/,18 December 2022,Had been anticipating this movie for a while and definitely was not disappointed. Movie is almost 3 hours long but doesn't really feel like it. Kept me fully invested throughout. Love how Ryan Coogler was able to handle Chadwick's passing with grace and dignity. It was a great send off for him. Will be rewatching when this movie comes out for sure. All characters were amazing. Felt the emotion of each and every character. Almost got chocked up a few times. Great action and great character development. Overall just a really good black panther film. Honestly liked this one more then the first. Can't wait for the next film!
," they tried but just couldn't replicate the magic
",Special-K88,/user/ur1596208/,17 December 2022,"Fans are taken back into the world of Wakanda where its citizens mourn the passing of King T'Challa, meanwhile intellectual Shuri, fierce Okoye, and noble Ramonda do their best to protect their homeland from intervening world powers. Despite the frequent globetrotting and a few surprises for longtime fans, the story isn't very captivating, in fact it's too long with far too much exposition, and much of the humor feels out of place. Give props to Coogler for taking on the unenviable task of crafting a sequel without his former lead actor Chadwick Boseman whose untimely death forced things to go in a much different direction, but his absence shows glaringly cause even though Bassett, Gurira, and especially Wright step up, other returning characters are underutilized, the new characters are not fully realized, and a major subplot makes one wonder if Marvel is trying to outclass DC for supremacy under the sea. **"
9," Entertaining and slightly goofy sequel to Black Panther
",PotassiumMan,/user/ur3564718/,17 December 2022,"The sequel to Black Panther has the daunting task of renewing that film's magic and wonder without Chadwick Boseman. In the end, it does a pretty admirable job, all things considered. It cannot live up to the original's achievement but still does a creditable follow-up. But the film combines a sensitive approach to mourning with the presence of mind of governing a nation in times of crisis.While mourning the loss of her brother T'Challa, Princess Shuri faces the direct challenge from the Talokan, an aggressive underwater tribe with formidable powers, as it starts to wage war against the western nations and then prepares for aggression against Wakanda itself. What follows is a cross-fire of international tensions and imperiled alliances. A delicate truce between Wakanda and the rest of the world is sorely tested. Leticia Wright is superb as the film's center of gravity. Tenoch Huerta makes an impression as a menacing but also funny antagonist, as king of the underwater rogue nation. Angela Bassett is a commanding presence as the Sovereign Queen Mother. Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke are given meager screentime, but both still make their presence felt with smallish roles. Dominique Thorne is down to earth and likeable as the brilliant MIT student whose craft falls into the wrong hands. Julia Louis-Dreyfus has an amusingly glib turn as the new CIA director.Although this film probably could have shed some of its running time, in the end, it makes for an engaging Marvel experience. A tighter film probably would have spent less time in the science lab but the more deliberate pace can be forgiven because the climax is so intense and well-executed. A globetrotting epic fight for world domination in the sea and on land never felt so brisk and sunny. Recommended to those looking for a wild adventure."
2," Wakanda Forever starts nicely
",IWasKnownAsThe1SentenceReviewer,/user/ur135925400/,17 December 2022,"Wakanda Forever starts nicely with a beautiful and emotional homage to actor Chadwick Boseman (more than T'Challa), the revealing of a strong and powerful Queen Raymonda and the denouncing of colonialism.But from there, everything turned to koeksister (West African dessert)...A very poor, messy and simplistic backstory for Namor; a very slow paced story; the feeling of DC-ja-vu when discovering the ""Atlantis""; a couple failed CGI flying Namor shots; and so forth.And please, stop with the water expelled from the mouth when recovering from a drowning. The water is either in the lungs (Riri would need to cough quite intensely) or in the stomach (she could vomit or just urinate it later)."
7," Slightly better than the first one.
",Top_Dawg_Critic,/user/ur64798417/,16 December 2022,"I liked the creativity of the narrative, certainly original and refreshing, but there was still too much cheesy dialogue and scenes that took away from the story. Plus both the hero and anti-hero were not convincing whatsoever in their roles. Tenoch Huerta's acting felt like it was his first ever acting role. And pretty much every attempt at humor was a miss, and ended up being cheesy and lame, some even feeling like Fendi subliminal advertising more than anything else. Even with the fairly decent pacing, the 161 min runtime felt much longer with many bloated and unnecessary scenes. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed it more than the first film, and it's a fairly decent one-time watch."
10," One of the best movies i have ever seen.
",anvarxojayevaa,/user/ur160020516/,16 December 2022,"""Only the most broken people can be great leaders."" (Namor, Wakanda forever). This quote was taken from the science fiction movie ""Wakanda forever"" which was released as a synopsis in July 2022 by Marvel Studios. The movie was released on November 11, 2022, and produced by Marvel Studios.The movie was the masterpiece ever created by Marvel studios. The movie represented how a woman can be powerful with Angela Basset's role in the movie as Queen Ramonda, she showed a powerhouse performance even though there were Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o and these roles were so regal that it could encourage many audiences' attention. Nevertheless, this movie would motivate other marvel characters when they work together with the most challenging parts.Generally, in ""Black Panther"" and ""Wakanda Forever"" the main characters of movies were black people who were humiliated. This film shows the elements of racism and discrimination. For example, heads of all countries gathered around and held a meeting where Queen Ramonda of Wakanda Forever also participated at the same time while she was in the meeting, the soldiers of France wanted to conquer the land of Wakanda. They thought the land of Wakanda is weak because of the death of Black Panther and as all Wakanda was ruled by a black woman who was considered as weak but her soldiers catches enemy soldiers
To conclude, If you are a fan of Marvel then you should watch this movie. It was one of the most powerful acting movies. Even from the technical side, the sound, the scenes, and the characters were perfectly set. The film received positive reviews and became the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2022."
3," Coarse and ludicrous, this movie is a complete failure
",alelorier,/user/ur29352746/,16 December 2022,"Golly miss molly, this movie is astoundingly stupid.Wakanda Forever is a confirmation that the super-hero genre is hitting rock bottom.I'll start with the only positive side : the casting. All actors are good and are more or less able to inhabit their characters with a touch of realism when all other aspects of the movie are shouting fake all the time. Only Martin Freeman and Julia Louis Dreyfus are looking lost, however it's not their acting that's at fault but just the fact that the scenes they appear in are just untethered from the main story line and thereby lost, uninteresting and just confusing.First the poor quality of the VFX is becoming a true issue. It does feel like watching a videogame most of the time when they are involved. At no point do they convey any sense of realism.Then the settings are so poor it's laughable. Both Wakanda and Namor's palace end up looking for what they are : sound stages with polystyrene and plywood constructs.The whole ideas and concept that are shown are just plain stupid. For instance, the big Wakandan battle ship is so poorly designed that you end up thinking it's a massive bathtub.There are many deaths due to fights all along the story and they are just brushed off as if they never happened. Only the main characters are mourned the rest of the plebe is obviously canon fodder.This last point is a perfect illustration of why ultimately, I think this movie is coarse. Basically it advocates that the very best political system in the world are monarchies and tyrannies. Wakanda which is supposed to be one the most advanced country in the world is just led with an iron grip by one family. This is after all quite normal since they are the only smart and tough people in the land. In this technologically advanced kingdom, there are no universities, no researchers, almost no scientists. All innovations are made by the 20-something year old sister of the king. The only true challenge to the family's power is a brute in the guise of M'baku who seems unable to utter a sentence without retorting to violence afterward when contradicted. All the guards, palace officials, priests and so forth are cowering servants to the royal bloodline. And to top it all the movie presents two democracies (yes, they are flawed still democracies) as the ultimate bad guys : France and the USA. C'mon man let's be serious two seconds.The whole experience smacks of deep rooted longing for fascists states that would be lead by conducators that are either muscular boors (Namor) or conflicted mad scientists (Shuri)."
6," Just disappointing.
",ashalan77,/user/ur54364945/,16 December 2022,"While there were parts that were entertaining as a whole this movie was just boring. They could have easily cut 40 minutes of the movie, there were many long pauses and seemed badly edited in parts.Tenoch Huerta as Namor was good. I like the actor and thought the changing of the character's story was decent knowing they're probably going to use his story to explain future characters entering the MCU.Choosing to make this movie more of an ensemble I felt wasn't the best choice as there are some characters that are not that interesting. Martin Freeman's character Everett Ross could have easily been cut from the film.Letitia Wright as Shuri was good but we have never seen her character train or fight outside of shootings blasters in the first Black Panther and Infinity War/End Game. It was kinda BS she could go toe to toe with Namor who is thousands of years old and clearly has more training than her.It made Shuri come off as a Mary Sue character which is sad as the character from the comics had a lot of training. All the wasted time on long takes and characters staring off into the background could have been used to develop her taking on the mantle. Instead she just puts the suit on and that's it..."
8," Good but slow
",mrglenngrant,/user/ur142268815/,15 December 2022,"Went to see in an almost empty screen 3 with Perrin - her for the second time and my first.I have to say that I liked it a lot more than the first Black Panther. There was no awful Chadwick accent to suffer ... and the story was better, with good action and more going on.The death of Chadwick was done really very well. I liked that they used an illness rather than have him killed by someone.There were some very lengthy dialogues which slowed things down a great deal.I thought I would hate the silly wee wings on Namor's ankles but it was actually done ok.I didn't like the blingy Black Panther costume ... or the fact that it was the wrong person to become Black Panther, for me. Why not make it the kick-ass warrior chick ... or does it have to be someone from the royal family? That makes sense, I guess.I hated the Midnight Angel.78/100."
7," Emotional and decent
",Flourduck,/user/ur34116972/,15 December 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is an emotional story that delivers a lot of action, while also feeling a bit rushed.A general theme in the movie is the passing of T'Challa, and it pays tribute to late actor Chadwick Boseman. This is done in a good way, adding a lot of emotional depth to certain scenes. I was quite emotional watching this movie, knowing that the sorrow portrayed on screen is in fact real.The cast is very good, and Angela Bassett provides a powerful performance in particular. Letitia Wright also does a good job at the forefront of the plot. The story also introduces some new characters that are interesting, but feel somewhat rushed. There was at least one character I felt was thrown into the story without being properly established, which weakens the impact of the plot.Tenoch Huerta provides a good portrayal of Namor, and the character is fleshed out to enrich the story. It's sad that we'll never see him on screen with T'Challa.The soundtrack is great, and so is the sets and costumes. It really portrays Wakanda as a genuine culture with a rich history. The underwater city of Talocan looks good. However, the movie relies a lot on CGI which is painfully evident in certain scenes. It sometimes feels like visual ""noise"" and becomes tedious at times.Overall, the movie provides a good and deeply emotional story, though it is burdened by an unstable plot. It works hard to fill the gap left by Boseman, and it partially succeeds in this. The lack of a strong, established lead makes the movie seem to lack a direction at times. Still, it deals with some tough issues and further builds on the story of Wakanda and the characters.A decent addition to the MCU."
6," Messy
",gardianx-33670,/user/ur146606039/,15 December 2022,The way they went with the movie is interesting really but the execution didn't live up to the hype that was advertised. In this movie you can tell in many scenes that it was supposed to be tchalla not Shuri. There should have been a significant amount of rewrites or a completely new script. The design choices in this movie is not that good really as Namor wasn't looking great and the same with iron heart. There are too many plot holes in this one and many open stories that would mention the 1st movie was abruptly closed and that overall experience was bland and boring to a fan and to the general audience this movie is something u only need to see once to understand the bigger picture.
9," That is how you do a sequel
",seanwriter,/user/ur102307772/,14 December 2022,It's been almost a month and I'm still not over this film. The visuals alone makes this movie enjoyable. I saw it in Imax 3D and need to see it again before it leaves theaters. The way they handle Chadwick not being in it was done in a good way. They didn't film any scenes yet with him so it made sense not to have any CGI or him in this film. If there is one complaint I have is the accuracy with the mythology. Namor is not the feather serpent God in the comics but Tenoch Huerta does a fantastic job in this film so I can't be too mad about that. And can we talk about Angela Bassett? That acting!
8," Wakanda Forever. Talokan Forever
",nadeekadarshana,/user/ur136244405/,14 December 2022,"Can't imagine where to start. The first thing to say is that Tchalla's tribute was so perfect, and the entire audience went silent. As a sequel, this is an awesome story, the way its characters have been balanced is so cool. The character building of Shuri felt Wow like the way Peter Parker's character in Spider-man No Way Home. It was completely brought up to Chadwick's level. I absolutely love the way the character's build-up was shown in those few hours. Ironheart doesn't have a big character build-up, maybe they put it in the upcoming Ironheart series because I saw footage of Riri Williams in the first Ironhard costume. After that, if you take Namor's character, he is the best villain in this phase 4. Namor's back story has changed when looking at the comic, But they have worked hard to show Namor in the same way in the comic. It can be said that one of the best villains built up in the MCU, more epic than Gorr the God Butcher seen in Thor: Love and Thunder. Almost everyone had good screen time and Ryan Coogler balaced everything. Feminism, LGBTQ, and jokes were balanced throughout the film. More emotional than action. Also, there was a good plot for the story, again the MCU seems to be on the right track. Namor is a badass guy. The people who play Namor and Shuri are obsessed with those characters. The next thing to remember is Music. It's crazy. BGM is so dope in many places. The best music and visuals are seen in phase 4. The visuals of Talokan are so great. Although there were minor glitches in the CG VFX, there were no major glitches in the overall film. Also, to make the plot stronger, they could have increased the running time of the story with vibranium. Based on vibranium and contains something like a good fight. But in comparison, this is a better film than the films that have come so far.Ryan Cougar is one of the best to direct Avengers Secret War. Unless the Russo brothers direct another Avengers film, Ryan is Marvel's best trump card.The only thing left to say after everything
Rest in Peace Chadwick Boseman. We really miss you."
8," A dificult task, but they managed to make a great movie.
",jpdrschutz,/user/ur119002930/,13 December 2022,"I can really understand why some people disliked, after all, the movie has a super slow pacing. But this aspect (and others too) don't convince me to not think that this movie was so incredible to me.Namor was the best thing that ever happened to this sequel, along with the soundtrack that was absolut magic.The bad side for me was some lazy decisions along from the directors, but nothing that would destroy the experience.It was a hard task to fulfill all expectations to this sequel, especially after the tragedy, but it is surely worth watch.If you're considering to, do it. But don't expect much fights or action. The movie has its pace, so just sit, relax and enjoy.8/10."
9," Strong and powerful like Vibranium
",rafaelcr44,/user/ur157168340/,13 December 2022,"The first Black Panther is my second favourite movie of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beat it was almost impossible, especially considering that we're in the phase four, a phase considered by both critics and fans the worst until today. And as almost everyone is tired of superhero movies being released almost monthly, my expectations were kind of low, I think I wouldn't watch this film in a theatre if Angela Bassett was not at the predictions for best supporting actress. And if she's nominated it won't be an absurd.But the main girl here is Letitia Wright. I disagree with her thoughts, but I have no antipathy for here due to them. She's incredible here, I felt all her emotions, her self-guilt, her constant mourn, she is devasted. Her arc is incredible, and she is, BY FAR, the best female protagonist in the MCU. I liked Dominique Thorne but her best is still to come; Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o are back again, both as imposing as usual; and Winston Duke is, again, as funny as usual.Duke is funny, but the film in general is not, and this is not a critic. I loved to see a more serious film in a universe where some movies have drowned in jokes badly placed. Ryan Coogler, as Jon Watts did in ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"", allows the sad moments to breathe, they're never interrupted by a joke or something, the audience can feel the importance of those moments.Tenoch Huerta is excellent, not at the same level as Michael B. Jordan in the first movie (again, it's quite impossible), but threatening. His people, Talokan, in a first moment reminded me of Avatar, but they have their own design, they're not generic, Marvel is not trying to copy James Cameron or Aquaman. Namor's motivations and decisions, both make sense, he's by far MCU's best villain since Thanos.The only problem I had was the notorious use of the chroma key, because there's a considerable number of times when the characters are on the first plan and the second plan is totally unfocused, accusing the use of the green screen. That's when you see how much this project was affected by the pandemic.Not only by the pandemic, but mainly by the loss of its star. Chadwick Boseman would be proud of what his fellow colleagues did to him here. They knew the strength of his character, they were respectful with him the whole time, and they knew exactly how to move on. Every time he's mentioned I had goosebumps, and there's a specific moment that can be top 5 of the entire Marvel history (if you watch you'll know).""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" should be taken as an example on how to make a tribute film. It celebrates the person who has gone but doesn't anchor itself to her. It's courageous, ambitious, and made with heart."
8," The king is dead... Long live the king.
",darigato,/user/ur103156384/,12 December 2022,"The unexpected and tragic passing of actor Chadwick Bosman (42, Get On Up, Black Panther) left quite a mark on the Marvel fan base as well as the entertainment industry as a whole. His performance as the first black comic book character was a defining one and with the sequel already announced prior, his death left everyone guessing, how will they follow up such a film with the high standard that Bosmen set.Although, the absence of Bosman's T'Challa is severely felt, the film is still entertaining as far as Marvel movies go. Unlike Christopher Nolan's approach in The Dark Knight Rises (2012) in which The Joker is never mentioned in respect for Heath Leger, Ryan Coogler (If Beele St. Could Talk, Creed) decided to make Bosman and T'Challa's death the main driving force of the film.Each character has a moment where they talk about what the Black Panther did for them and how they remember him, in the same way Bosman's performance impacted movie fans the comics community as strongly as it did.Everyone experiences grief differently, yet people are united by it and Coogler truly made this film about that. The opening funeral scene is very powerful and Angela Basset and Danai Gurira make stellar performances as warriors broken by their loss. The introduction of Namor (Tenoch Huerta) is also a kick-ass scene that does justice to the cult favourite anti-hero.One thing that this film suffers from however is, whenever they hire a director with a certain style such as Shane Black, Taika Watiti or James Gunn, Marvel's urge to stay slavishly faithful to the ""superhero"" format gets in the way of a lot of the interesting ideas that notable filmmakers can do with these stories and it has only been getting worse post-Endgame.There are some that occasionally diverge from the format such as Iron Man 3, and Thor: Ragnarok (although these too end up wrapping it up with a depth-free CGI battle) and the first Black Panther was one of these. Coogler kept the story as contained as he could without shoehorning in many elements from the other films.Coogler's return made certain that this entry stayed as intimate as it could be without intrusion from the other Marvel worlds in the universe, though IronHeart (Dominique Thorne) and the land of Talkoan, felt very forced in their inclusion.Despite all that's annoying about it. Wakanda Forever is still a must-see."
6," Clever, Moving, but Too Long
",sme3,/user/ur6941579/,12 December 2022,"BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER opens impressively with scenes that are moving, creepy, and exciting. Each scene also demonstrates how smartly the filmmakers have addressed the sizeable challenge caused by the premature death of Chadwick Boseman, the actor who portrayed Black Panther. Unfortunately, as a superhero film absent its superhero, the forward momentum of the plot begins to stall and drift during a sometimes flabby middle section of the film. The many unwieldy narrative threads do come together into a satisfying and moving conclusion. As with its predecessor, the production values - especially the costume design - are outstanding."
4," Even worse than Spiderman NWH and Thor 4
",alonlankri,/user/ur158636367/,12 December 2022,"Phase 4 has lost all direction. Actions have no consequences, comedic timing is dead, emotional impact of loss has been erased, and even mystery has been replaced with immediate reveals.The acting is wooden all the way through except the queen and Mbaku. Meaningless illogical phrases fill it like ""it's not important how, it's important why."" Yes, how is incredibly important in a movie like this. The resolution didn't solve anything. The stupidity of Wakanda's plan, fighting mermaids at sea. How half-baked and exploitationist the mermaids were portrayed compared to the Wakandans. ""A colonist in chains."" Just ugh. Even Aquaman was better and I hated that movie. The only reasonable movie in phase 4 is Shang Chi. Women in the MCU ALWAYS beat men, if not in round one then round 2. It's like watching The Rock in a movie, you know he wins, always. The stories in phase four are so painfully formulaic and repetitive, compared to Thor Ragnarok and IW EG where actual losses and sacrifices happened, where battle results weren't known ahead of time."
9," Heavy and emotional, but then it is about death and loss
",keninfife,/user/ur65351855/,11 December 2022,"I went to see this with my 2 kids, we all enjoyed it. The feel and pace is quite different from the first movie, it is slower, more time devoted to quiet interactions between characters. But this is unsurprising as the central theme is loss and our choice between being consumed by hate or accepting and feeling the pain. But if it is the action and gadgets your after, it is all there too. I commend this movie for the thought put into integrating these themes, rather than treating it as yet another cash cow. Although I felt it lacked the humour of the previous movie, the acting, the music, the special effects were on point."
1," Terrible Movie
",lpagiazitis,/user/ur84304495/,11 December 2022,"Very disappointing movie. Acting was mediocre at best, story was extremely predictable and uninspired, and last but not least most characters lacked proper character development, motivations and backstories. Beyond the overall low quality of the movie, it goes on to stain and degrade the legacy of other popular and established heroes such as Ironman and Black Panther. As an example, in my humble opinion you cannot replace a popular super hero like Ironman with a character that was just introduced moments earlier. The original Ironman from the Marvel cinematic universe had many challenges, character arcs and a backstory that spanned over 3 standalone movies not including the Avenger movies. The story told in said movies helped facilitate a connection with the character and a deep understanding for the characters thoughts/motivations that led to each decision made. To simplify, we understood the character and why they did what they did. Good storytelling and character development creates a unique understanding where you could imagine how a character would react with in any situation. Oppositely, the same cannot be said about 90 percent of the characters in Wakanda Forever. This is especially true for the new super hero chosen to take the mantle of Ironman in this movie. That being said, most of the characters suffered from this same issue. Even the new Black Panther character suffered from this lack of story although it is important to note an attempt was at least made when it came to her portrayal of Black Panther. The movie felt like a cash grab opposed to an interesting and well thought out story that should have and/or could have been entertaining. It seemed like a jumbled over utilization of video effects lacking crucial movie elements. Very disappointing. Lastly, I would be curious to see the unedited version of Wakanda Forever looks like.... Perhaps the cut scenes added to each characters development the same way the Snyder's Cut did to Justice League?"
10," Gorgeous Movie
",nnita-87067,/user/ur117043396/,11 December 2022,Beautiful tribute to Chadwick! Held back tears throughout the whole movie and couldn't contain them any longer at the end. I love how they brought the Maya and Aztec culture to life. To bring that into a superhero movie was so amazing. Mexicans (and when you read this I mean of darker complexion) rarely ever get to be seen in the light of being strong and united. To see that in a sci-fi movie was just pure joy. I'm hoping Namor's character develops and turns good. Even though I'm sure he won't. I can only hope. This way can can see more of our people on the big screen. Big props to the director!
6," Great CG can't make up for a convoluted plot and poor script
",buzzpark,/user/ur3660319/,11 December 2022,"I'm probably the only person willing to tell the truth for fear of being labeled a bigot.It was beautifully shot and well-acted, but had a unnecessarily convoluted plot/storyline. The CG and action were great, but it seemed like those elements were heightened to cover a poor script.Upon reflection, this movie creates far more questions than it answers. Also, the motives and reactions of the Talokanil king just weren't believable.This movie really needed to either be cut down to 2 hours or the plot needed to be much better fleshed out. Action for action's sake never saves a movie that is poorly written.Definitely better than Black Adam, but just OK."
7," Definitely ambitious?
",cliftonofun,/user/ur1409915/,11 December 2022,"The first Black Panther tried to do the impossible: use the most franchisey franchise ever to deliver not just a powerful and significant film, but a cultural moment. Somehow, it worked. The sequel tries to do something even harder. Actually, it tries to do a lot of things. Coogler attempts to pay tribute to the late great Chadwick Boseman, to make another story about giant ideas (faith, grief, colonialism), to make a superhero movie without the hero, to elevate a ton of new characters, and to advance the MCU along in the process. It is a lot. Maybe that is why it ended up 2 hours and 40 minutes long. The good news is I was genuinely both entertained and moved at points. The bad news is I also spent too much time either wishing we could move things along, rolling eyes at the over the top technology, or wondering if this was an Avatar crossover event. Basically, some things worked and some things didn't. It was better than the most recent MCU movies I think (and the highs are higher), which says something given everything it tried to do. It was also worse than any other Coogler movie to date, which makes me hope he can do something less franchisey next time around."
9," Wakanda Forever!
",jroze13-18-86744,/user/ur25569033/,11 December 2022,"I can not imagine the production struggles this film went through and they still presented a near perfect movie. I think Marvel giving Ryan Coogler the helm allowed this to be brought to the big screen the way it was meant to be. Such a solid tribute to Chad and the Balck Pamther character. Action sets that were awesome, and sets that were beautiful. Angela Bassett needs her Academy Award, she is a revelation. The other characters do play a significant part in the plot development as well. Denia Gurira also gives a fierce performance. The weight of the film lies on Letitia Wright's shoulders as we travel with her through her grieve and struggles she does an outstanding job balancing all these emotions. This was not my favorite Marvel movie but is up there for story development and emotional depth."
7," Good Marvel film
",Jolle97,/user/ur119412064/,11 December 2022,"Cinematically, this is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. The soundscape and cinematography were superb. I thought the antagonist was a suitably powerful and multi-dimensional character, which made him interesting. There were many good scenes in the film, but more pleasing to the visual eye than actual dialogue. The first time the ""sea people"" attacked the ship made me expect a lot from this film. BUTThe story got pretty bogged down and maybe three hours is too long for a Marvel superhero movie, even if the theme and subject matter is important. I personally was not the target audience for the theme, which is why the dialogue felt forced at times. Some scenes felt episodic. The only white man in the story is a dumb agent, why?A small moment of illogic when Namor wants Wakanda as an ally, by THREATENING HER? Namor is not good at psychological negotiation even though he is otherwise very capable. There are many other illogical scenes in the film.BUT most importantly I enjoyed the movie for the most part and the cinematography was top notch. That's why this was also an above average film."

",Marco_Nocifora,/user/ur53013181/,10 December 2022,"The movie was too much predictable, a tale which we all knew the ending.Too much time was wasted on useless scenes, just to make the audience more empathic towards the death of Chadwick Boseman. It felt like the pace was just too slow, ramping up only in the ""war"" scenes. One thing I personally liked was the presentation of this new civilization, the Talokanils. I enjoyed the mix between Mayans mythology and the tales of Atlantis: all the names and places of Talokan are clear references to both. I even liked the design of Namor, which is a clear reference to the greek god Mercury.Super bland was the internal conflict inside Shiri, which saw Killmonger instead of his brother. Too much left untold. They should have focused more on scenes like theese instead of forcing fake sorrow on the watcher.All in all it's not a bad film, the problem is that it wasn't made for audience the same age as me_____________________________________________SCORECARDIn a range from 1 to 5, i'll give a value to each entry written below.

",stuedell,/user/ur15911267/,9 December 2022,"Many other reviewers have fully delineated the troubles with this horrible film, so i will just add that i found the story both insulting, confusing and just painfully sad. The female lead has no stage presence or charisma and
quite honestly she was the worst actor i have ever seen in the role as the main character in any film. Her complete inability to realistically was insulting, as was her mumbled dialog. The battle scenes were flatout insulting, with no one ever actually getting injured or killed.Add to all that the 2.8 hour length and i was quite literally praying for it to end on each of the Four false endings. My Company rented out a theater and paid for our tickets to see this movie, and i still felt ripped off."
6," New Black Panther!
",youngbmega,/user/ur136436332/,9 December 2022,"Why is the fourth phase of the MCU so all, somehow, slurred? Apart from some pictures of course. But still, the whole phase seems to be not completely connected with each other. And all of it consists of more than ten pictures, including serials, but now is not about that. As you can see, quantity does not mean quality. And it also ""hooked"" the Black Panther, which, as for me, is just as slurred. A tribute to Chadwick Boseman is certainly the right thing to do (this is not a spoiler, it was clear in the trailers and so it was). But after the conflict already begins, which is not unambiguous, of course, everything starts to go sluggishly. Plus, with the introduction of a new ""hero"", it also somehow turned out chaotically. And most likely, they either did not try on the costume, or they did everything in a hurry (it looks like a plastic toy in fact). Shuri is the main character, and now she is the Black Panther, but ... there is one small plot, so to speak, a reserve for the future, which not everyone will like for one reason or another. ""Why so, and exactly so?"" I ask myself, it's not clear. But, as the completion of the fourth phase, it was possible to try a little or something. The first picture was somehow more harmonious, you felt Tchala as a new king, his formation. Here it looks different, and for the worse."
2," It's OK not to like this movie
",govtmule-94509,/user/ur158813873/,9 December 2022,"I don't know why the critics hype this movie, I'm speculating it's because the studio sunk $250 million dollars in this confusing marathon and are pushing it to get their ROI.My first thought was what a long time to be sitting in a theater to watch a movie. Wakanda is one of the longest Marvel movies at 2 hours and 41 minutes. I took several breaks and didn't miss anything when I got back.If you have not seen the first movie you will be lost trying to keep up with the circuitous script and backstories. It was hard to stay interested in this story. It just goes on and on and on with all this drama that I didn't understand or care about.To recap, the movie lost me immediately, and didn't explain ""why"" and ""how"" all these people were connected. Angela Bassett did a good job and she was the only character I knew. They could have trimmed off an hour and nobody would have complained and it would have been a better film."

It has just become tired to watch the same fantasy of destroying armies of men with simple little tools and having to pay with nothing for it. Nothing is at stake. No one can die. What's the point of watching it? You know everyone will survive. You know they will totally destroy all the men because special units obviously never trained like them. LOL.Disney is finished and this is the last straw. All the characters are unlikeable. I was cheering for France in the beginning."
," Nice tribute to Boseman, but this is just another sequel
",gortx,/user/ur0366508/,9 December 2022,"It's difficult enough to create a satisfying sequel to a hugely successful original, but, it's an even harder bridge to build when the actor who plays the title character passes away suddenly. Director Ryan Coogler and co-writer Joe Robert Cole return here and do a decent enough job paying tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman while trying to forge a path forward in the Black Panther saga.The main plot revolves around the world discovering that another nation has discovered a source of vibranium - previously the exclusive domain of Wakanda. The Talokan are a South American undersea community. Conflict ensues.It's not the most unworkable concept, but, Coogler and Cole drag out every turn in the story. Whenever a plot point is revealed, one can be assured that it will take at least 20 minutes to explain it. It is interesting that the U. S. and most of the rest of the world take a backseat to Wakanda and the Talokan. It does re-arrange one's mindset. Still, any viewer who has even read a review of a superhero film knows that it will all climax in a big battle.The overall production is good with solid tech credits all around particularly a stirring score by Ludwig Goransson who does all he can to make all those expository scenes seem exiting. The cast is strong, as well. There are some cogent takes on duty, revenge and honor, but, in the end, WAKANDA FOREVER is basically: Just another Marvel sequel."

The biggest strength of this movie is the characters and their motivations. The outline of the story looks like a throne fight between two brothers but inside it is more than you think.Chadwick stars as the titular character and fits that role perfectly. As a king, he chooses what is best for his people and also the world but he is the same king as previous kings in Wakanda. Everything changes when the killmonger arrives.Both Hero and villain journey are more than interesting. The film respects African people and their culture, history. This is one of the MCU movies with a lot of female characters and justifies them. Black Panther is a triumph of universal appeal and demographic specificity.The film is comparatively light on action, and the pacing occasionally stumbles in the back half, but the sharp character work and rich production design make up for nitpicks here and there. And when the action does arrive, it is brutal and to the point, with a second-act car chase combining real-world action with Wakandian technology that I could watch on a loop for hours on end.The first act is dedicated to setting up the world of Wakanda (an isolated nation shielded from the outside world and powered by otherworldly technology and arguably a What if Africa had never been colonized fantasy) and T'Challa's from prince to king coronation process."
6," Black Panther: Wakanda Forever
",tmcmaster-67512,/user/ur84410555/,6 December 2022,"RIP Chadwick BosemanOff the bat, this is not better then the first Black Panther. The villain in this film is the main reason why. Killmonger felt like a true foil to Black Panther. I have already forgotten the name of the sequels villain but I remember he had wings on his ankles. Also when killmonger does show up near the end of the film, he makes the princess have to choose to either be a hero or a villain and it's so out of left field it made little sense. If you're going to have her struggle with who she is it should've been introduced long before the 3rd act. In no way was I expecting her conscience to be seesawing between good and evil the entire film.What's good about the film, is the tributes to Boseman. They were well earned and heartwarmingly done. The special effect in my opinion were actually better than the first and much better than what marvel has been putting out lately. Ryan Coogler also got some fantastic performances out of these actors. Angela Bassett stole the show and was acting circles around everyone else. Lelita Wright is meant to be a star and Lupita Nyong'o is one of the finest actors working today. She deserves to win more Oscars. She is just a beautiful amazing actor. Whoever played the villain on the other hand needs acting school. The character and actor were just awful.All in all this is a solid film for marvel, who seem to have lost the magic they once had. Some great performances and great special effects and helmed by a very legit director. Couldn't ask for much more than that as a follow up to one of the best superhero movies ever made."
6," Great art and music, but need to polish the scenario
",Aoi_kdr,/user/ur89944726/,6 December 2022,"Cross your arms, and let's sayWAKANDA FOREVER!!!!!It reminded me what I felt at the school festival
when a classmate told me that let's gather and say loudy after our show, ""Our class is the best!""The embarrassment I felt in the last one is still there. However, modern technology collaborates African nations art and cultures. Also, their tribe's costumes and music suit very well with the movie. It was eye-pleasing!The actor who played as Ti Chara had been already fighting the illness while shoothing the last one. In the latest one, Ti Chara was also gone. So, there's sadness and reality in the funeral scene and the last one.This time, the setting is Wakanda after the loss of Black Panther. How do the queen and his sister, Shuri, confront international community which is after vibranium and the loss of Black Panther?Good points of this series are that each character, regardless of gender and ethnicity, is portrayed with great pride. The queen, Shuri, Okoye and even Talocan's king Kukulkan, all of them proud and want to protect something. I felt sad because nobody's villain.Overall, the video and characters were attractive and worth watching, but there's something I'm not convinced.There's some spoilers below!The first is that they solved the issue with Talokan by force at the end. The stronger conquers, and the weaker succumbs. I wonder if it is okay to continue this composition in this age? The story isn't only about heros, and also is about war. Is it okay to handle it like this and finish in that way? I feel like that what Marvel studio portrays is highly influential.The second is that two problems haven't been solved yet. One of them is about Okoye. Althought the queen fired her and died without letting her making up for her fault, it was written off by replacement of queens. Nothing was solved.Also, the other is about that I couldn't find how they are going to deal with international community which targetting vibranium in the future. Actually Talocan attacked American research vessel, but, Wakanda's stance has been still unclear in the internationa community without resolving that misunderstanding. The ending shows how they'll deal with Talocan for sure. Regardless of showing the problem about the worse relationship between Wakanda and the international community in the first part of movie, the ending ignored it. I'm uncomfortable.Other than that, all music was amazingly good anyway. The second song in the end credit was a kind of funny because of the recorder's sound. I was about to laugh, but I like it now after listening to it many times."

6," Seven Revolutions in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever
",nickynovelo,/user/ur159630804/,6 December 2022,"""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is the sequel to the extremely popular ""Black Panther"" featuring fan favorite Chadwick Boseman. Although a mediocre movie at best, the film touches on and features a number of 7 Revolutions, bringing them to light for the audience. Throughout the movie the biggest revolutions that I've noticed include resource management, conflict, technology, and governance. Despite finding the movie a bit cliche and rather predictable, I believe that it does a fantastic job tying all of these revolutions together in a way that is interesting and entertaining for audiences to watch.Starting off the movie, we see the revolution of governance through the funeral of King T'Challa, the Black Panther, as a tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman. After the king's death, his mother, Queen Ramonda, made a return to the throne as the queen. Throughout the film, the throne is passed on from King T'Challa to Queen Ramonda, then to Shuri after Queen Ramonda's death, and it finally ends in the hands of the most recent king, King M'Baku of the Jabari tribe. This highlights the revolution of governance as it shows the struggles that Wakanda goes through trying to govern the nation. Another big revolution that is featured in this movie is the revolution of resource management. With vibranium being such a luxury in the MCU, many different countries wish to get their hands on it. However, it is very scarce so few have access. As such, many nations go on the search for vibranium and eventually one of the detectors found some in the underwater nation of Talokan. This soon ties in to the next revolution of conflict. With the discovery of the vibranium in the secret nation of Talokan, Namor, the main antagonist of the movie, wants to kill the scientist who created the vibranium detector. He threatens a war on the surface world in order to ensure the safety of his people. Nations want to advance their technology with vibranium which shows the revolution of technology. If countries were given vibranium, they will have further access to more advanced tech. Fearing that countries would gain access to such tech, Wakanda has since been gatekeeping their mountain of vibranium. Wakanda was afraid that if corrupt countries had access to vibranium they would become more and more vibranium thirsty. Then these countries would be able to start and win wars with my other weaker, different countries. This development touches bases with the revolutions of resource management, conflict, and technology.Despite finding the movie overbearing, too long, and very cliche, I enjoyed seeing how the 7 Revolutions play a part in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Seeing fan favorite characters deal with the 7 Revolutions just like the real world was fun and entertaining. The writers did a wonderful job connecting many of the different, significant revolutions that were highlighted in the movie. In this way, the characters are made more human and it shows that they too, despite having superpowers, advanced tech, etc., still struggle with such issues as significant as the 7 Revolutions."
10," TALOKAN FOREVER!
",wesleylittle,/user/ur158360629/,6 December 2022,"I personally was rooting for Namor the entire time. Anyway, the story is INCREDIBLY well written. I don't get why so many people are mad at Marvel for not recasting T'challa. Letitia Wright was great! As to why I was never rooting for Wakanda...
1: Namor is fighting for his people, and Shuri was fighting out of hatred.2: Namor's reasoning was understandable. I mean, he wasn't in the right, but I get where he was coming from. He wanted to kill Riri because he didn't want people discovering his home and either destroying it, or taking it for themselves. Shuri was understandable too, he killed her mom. But risking hundreds of lives just because of revenge? Nope.3: Talokan is just plain cool!"
7," Black Panther - The Way of Water
",Slarkshark,/user/ur24179951/,6 December 2022,"The best thing about 'Wakanda Forever' were the tributes to King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman). There was a big question mark as to how the Black Panther tangent within the MCU would continue. I believe the way they handled it was the best and most respectful way they could have done it.As for the rest of the film, it felt very average. Namor and his Empire looked great and were interesting, however a few things left me bewildered. I took issue with Namor making no mention of the ""Blip"". I understand the MCU wanting to move past this event, but when something that grand happens, it can't simply be ignored, especially when introducing a whole new civilization. It also begs the question, that if he is willing to declare all out war due to a single death of one of his people, than what about when half the population of his empire is suddenly dusted? Would that not be sufficient in revealing yourself? Oh and by the way Namor, it was Wakandan's who fought all those battles... you're welcome. And one last bit to this rant, Namor's people attacked and abducted the princess of Wakanda during a mission he sent them on. That is a HUGE deal in any nation, never mind Wakanda. Yet, he's upset and acting as if Wakanda struck first; no they did not. As Obi-Wan said to the arrogant Anakin ""you have done that yourself"".I'm sorry, but Iron Heart looked straight up like a Beetleborg, and her lines throughout were cringe. I think I speak for a large majority in stating that I would have been more interested in seeing Harley Keener (kid from 'Iron Man 3') as the inventor of the vibranium detecting machine and so on. Perhaps they have different plans for him, so we shall see. The rest of the cast did a fine job. I really liked the direction they took with Shuri and her being more of Killmonger type Panther.As with the first, good music throughout. Much respect to Mr. Ross, listening to Chili Peppers 'Can't Stop' while running.As expected, Phase Four has not been as good as the previous phases. And 'Wakanda Forever' was not my favourite film during this phase. Everything since 'Endgame' just feels like additional quests or DLC after you beat the main campaign in a video game."
," Frustrating.
",Darwinskid,/user/ur12357883/,5 December 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever has ambitious goals but does not manage to meet them due to its overlong and sometimes unfocused screenplay that often feels very first draft level in craft and trying to have one too many political conversations to streamline linearly. It has its moments, with some very solid dramatic acting work by its performers, but on the whole it is an admirable effort but also a major step down in quality from its predecessor. I personally feel they should have waited on a sequel, and take more time to figure out what to do with the Black Panther and Wakanda as the Marvel Cinematic Universe was progressing post Endgame and after the unfortunate passing of Chadwick Boseman. The loss of T'Challa is seriously felt in this story, and I think most would have been fine with a recast just a few years later, the new actor might not have been on Mr. Boseman's level, but they could have still performed the part well and carry the franchise further. As is, the mantle gets passed, and its executed just okay, but it would have more impact if the story were more focused. Namor is a nice addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and is adapted fine, I would certainly like to see more of him in later installments. Still, you feel that the character probably should have come into the picture a lot earlier on, like in Phase Two or Phase Three at the least."
10," Better than i expected
",cdevito-34632,/user/ur133687050/,5 December 2022,"I enjoyed the first Black Panther. It was entertaining. I expected a sloppy story without Chadwick Boseman. Leticia Wright is the heart of this movie and delivers an amazing performance. It was a long movie, but never dragged. It never felt like a superheroe movie. It was more like an epic battle of power and family driven movie. Leticia Wright proves she is a star and can step into the role of Black Panther. The MCU did her character right. She will be able to hold her own in future MCU movies. This is the female superhero that MCU needs. Although Black Widow was a fun movie.....the female Black Panther is the one to watch."
9," Very good. I was surprised.
",gbrezina2015,/user/ur39199363/,5 December 2022,"I wasnt' sure if I'd like this movie w out Chadwick Boseman. I didn't want to see it but I went w my husband anyway. It was exceptionally good. I wasn't sure what the story line or plot was going to be so what's the purpose in doing a story w out T'Challa but they might have even outdone the first one. The silence at the beginning and at the end was breathtaking. The marvel tributes to Boseman were so well done and the costume designer...I wish she designed all my clothes. Wow, just wow. Angela Bassett in the first purple dress was just stunning. The all white at the funeral, again, was breathtaking. I even thought Shuri did a great job of ""replacing"" her brother, as it were. She caried the mantel well. The music throughout was great too. I was surprised by how good it all was, in a good way."
7," Namor the Gogo Boy
",manufoto,/user/ur147891307/,5 December 2022,"The funniest part was when Namor (Tenoch Huerta) appears wearing gogo boy panties! Hahaha! Couldn't take the character seriously with that costume choice. Other than that the movie was ok. A little long, the scenes dragged a bit. It also lacked that humorous aspect that Marvel movies usually have. Lupita Nyong'o, gorgeous as always, and I really loved her presence in the movie. Dominique Thorne, the college girl, left me wondering why they added this plot to the movie... is she to become some special CIA agent? Julia Louis Dreyfus character was good, she's funny, I wished we had seen more of her."
7," Not the best
",lakings97,/user/ur9679268/,4 December 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever was long, boring at times it was meaningless. It felt like a long tribute to Chadwick Boseman, the constant reminders and repetition of his death was not necessary. The new villain is the first Hispanic character of the Marvel universe, Namor, played by Tenouch Huerta. The storyline was much similar to Aquaman and the search for Atlantis. In the name of comparison DC did a better job than Marvel. In regards to the new Black Panther, Letitia Wright is not the strongest actor to play a superhero. Marvel seems to be in the wrong path, not producing well scripted movies with good actors. I can't say it was great nor I would suggest not to see this flick."
8," Fulfilled expectations
",joseythekitsune,/user/ur156724305/,4 December 2022,"-MOVIE REVIEW-Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) - 8.0/10First of all I have to say this movie did absolutely fulfil any expectations, that most sequels never could. Combination of well performed acting, flabbergasting cinematography and excellent script writing brought this movie to my personal favourites from the MCU films.My main observations are the following (! CONTAINS SPOILERS!) :Outstanding feature: diversityOne of the biggest distinctive features of this movie and the ""Black Panther"" storyline in general is the inclusiveness of black people. In this production the projector is shining especially on black women, which is a great way to bring representation. That however pisses some people off (alike my father who was raptured to see a production constructed with black characters mainly) which speaks for itself that they did a great job with the inclusiveness.-acting
I was absolutely bemused with the acting of the actress who plays Okoye, Danai Gurira. The scene where she was brought down from her position in the kingdom was absolutely perfect because of her emotional performance. She seems to be in absolute control of recreating both very explosive and subtle emotions even when they are right one after another! In fact all of the main visages had no problem with achieving that as well.-symbolism and social problems
In each art piece there could be a big variety of meanings all depending on a person's point of view. And so in movies, because they are also as artistic, it's the same. There could be defined problem topics,!shown indirectly, such as balancing contemporaries and traditions, equality, grief, slavery, pride and ethics are easily noticeable even without much analysing. As in Marvel movies from the past two years, they have a pattern when they start to play around with differentially ""good"" characters and making them act like villains, supposedly because that's the ""right"" thing to do in the storyline. Which adds a lot to the psychological effect on the viewers.-emotional impact
The emotion troughout this whole movie was absolutely intense. As stated above the actors' play was immaculate. There were especially two three turning points in my opinion (the two plot twists containing Shuri and the scene I mentioned earlier). Most outstanding is how whole movie partially pushes its viewers into rooting for murder, ""an eye for an eye"" sort of homicide, and even tosses to the side that it's an act which is life-ending to the victim. But then the antagonist sticks to her principles and doesn't execute the killing idea. Thus it's show how no matter how much one desires revenge, it won't fix the damaged. Therefore that exposes one of the biggest importances in the Marvel universe is striving for the best of the human condition. Or well that's ever since Disney bought the company.-MCU insight
No matter the absence of king T'Challa in the movie his testament was continued. The idea of chasing the best outcome in each occurring fight and protection of the nation were just as powerful as in the movie. That's why the production as a whole felt like a natural continuation of the first movie, a perfect alliance was attained. Two main turning points were obtained in the plot, both were breathtaking. One being the battle between Namor and Shuri and its contents. And the other being the after credit scene. Each one was a well scripted scene that was built up to but I still have a few bad impressions about the movie.-Scriptwriting
I have only one bad note to talk about here, which I am not sure how objective is, but the action scenery was too much at times, and there was basically no introduction, the viewers had to puzzle the pieces in the process of the movie meaning some important information about the movie was missed if the watcher didn't pay all their attention to the details. Other than that, the characters were very well developed and richly built in depth. The plot was very well put together and connected, no plot holes and so on.This I concluded the movie deserves a 8.0 out of 10."
1," Absolutely awful
",ximena_corona,/user/ur31874930/,4 December 2022,"This was horrible, the only good part was the first 15 minutes, after that this just sucks. Like always this call super hero's only brings dead to everyone. They just do what it's best for them. Wakanda it's the worst. I fell sleep after 30 minutes of watching this. Please just don't waste your time or money. I hope they never make another Black Panther movie, they're just ridiculous and boring. And what a lack of respect they made another culture to bend the knee just because they wanted. Hope this movie just disappears and never ever again they made another one. Don't waste your time, that's my advice."
3," Underwhelming
",fahedbarakat,/user/ur159563231/,4 December 2022,"Way too long for movie. I really enjoyed the effects and the budget however, the movie itself felt lacking and very muddled. Just too much going on for no reason and felt bloated despite a basic storyline.I'd recommend it for the effect as they were decent and budget was clearly of no limit in this movie but that's all. Otherwise it's too much of a children's girl power movie that is banking purely on the legacy of the first movie.I felt like they wanted to merge the first movie wokanda with a avatar-is inspired fish bad guy with pigeon feather on his feet that is totally unrealistic.Also things like the siren song felt random in the movie that could have been much more import."
7," The best mcu film in a while
",johnnynewell,/user/ur142492760/,4 December 2022,This movie was a breath of fresh air after seeing all the absolute awful other mcu projects that came out this year. When seeing this film it reminded me what seeing an mcu film should feel like and oh how I missed that feeling. The movie deals with Chadwick Bosmen's death very well and doesn't pull a typical Disney move and replace the actor or remake him with cgi or anything instead they explore shiris feelings of grief which is a good contrast to the villains feeling of grief. The best thing this movie does is making shiri an actual character instead of the main characters sister that does nothing the whole time and whose point in the movie is completely missing. This isn't the case with shiri anymore but this is the case for a lot more people.The new student scientist character gets introduced and the movie kinda forgets about her halfway through. This is the same case for the white business man guy. Speaking of him his subplot absolutely sucks and should not have been in the film. This movie is also to long. It's pacing is pretty good most of the time but near the end it really stars to drag on.Overall this is an improvement for marvel and is definitely better then the original black panther but it's still not perfect. I hope marvel releases more movies like this but until then I guess all I can do is hope.
8," Not bad at all, well done
",Nyc_Don_DrKing,/user/ur52256250/,4 December 2022,"Wow...where to start this movie played on them heart strings & then some.1st off Shuri (Letitia Wright) severely impressed me from the last film. They put this on her shoulders & Tenoch & Angela and my goodness did they ever shine thru.2nd Romonda (Angela Bassett) myyyy goodness. To say that you felt her performance is an understatement for me. You could clearly see each prior actor was dealing with this in their own way.3rd Namor or N'amor ğŸ˜�(Tenoch Huerta) I am a avid believer in portraying the characters as they were created,im not a big fan of race,gender bending in any way, I have to say this I was HEAVILY impressed Tenoch showcased Namor's several sides of Namor I've grown accustomed to reading & Tenoch delivered. I actually enjoyed the polar opposite to Wakanda yet similarities of both nations as well.Scene stealer number 4 was M'Baku everytime he was on the screen it was his film, hilarious character. The changes made felt right fit this movie, not saying it will work for every film but felt & meshed well with it's other parts. Now story alone they pulled from a few different ones. They could have done a proper DOOMWAR arc yeah,but they did well overall. While at the same time showing Homage to Chadwick that post scene was spot on letting you know T'Challa is still here & could open up to other possibilities like T'Challa & Storm. I do wish it had more action scenes or should I say that final battle had been a bit longer ğŸ˜�. Overall good film good tribute waiting to see what the future holds."
7," Pancakes the movie
",obedrosario,/user/ur154057404/,4 December 2022,"WAY TO LONG!!! My family are huge marvel and dc fans and this one handled the villain with skill but it took way to do so. Felt as if they tried way too hard to fill time. The story was going all over the place and having to fill the viewer in with long boring dialogue and it was done lazily. The action scenes were hit and miss, sometimes with no point. I really wished I didn't have to write 600 words, cause this movie only moved me to regret not waiting till it was in Disney + cause it was just filler...Pancakes!!! That's what I would call it, taste good in the beginning then slowly I started hating it feeling as if I was being tortured with my family stuck there with me cause we paid for it.."
4," Directionless and bloated
",Rangel93,/user/ur67713964/,3 December 2022,"Franchise is over without Chadwick Boseman, Letitia wright is a supporting actress at best. She can't carry the black panther mantle as Boseman did. Also how they went from Chadwick Boseman as black panther to an anti-vaxxer is beyond me and is an insult to his name. Using queen ramondas death as a way to make us feel sorry for shuri as she tries to be a wannabe killmonger was cheap and forced. The new armors look as if they were created by kindergartners. Seriously they look like power ranger villains knockoffs. Namor and Mbaku were the only good things in the movie. Better to stream at home."

6," A couple of flaws but great moments as well.
",kumaresanvishnu,/user/ur76106512/,3 December 2022,"Firstly, the shoes that Ryan Cooglar(the director) had to fill must have been hard especially because there are people who want to replace Chadwick Boseman as well people who do not want Chadwick Boseman replaced. And I heard they completed the plans for this movie with chadwick Boseman as Black Panther but after his death they had change plans. If this was really true then it must be tough. So I kept my expectations really low for this movie and it was not bad. Firstly the screenplay was written poorly. Don't get me wrong, most characters(not all) were great but the dialogue needs work. Certain things in this movie did not make sense(not gonna say which ones as it will be a spoiler if I do). The actor who played Namor I felt was great at certain parts(as he sounded intimidating a bit in certain scenes) and other scenes he just felt like a normal dude and did not sound intimidating although that was they were going for. Shuri's character development was only not bad. Besides Namor another character(iron heart) was introduced(she definitely needs a lot of work on her character-she is basically a super smart character with literally almost no flaws and she might just be the smartest character in the mcu and her character in all honesty was just boring). The ending of this film could've been better. Earlier I stated certain things in this film did not make sense and it was because some character decisions were dumb and scenes were unrealistic. The good thing is that there was world building and the action sequences were much better here than in BP 1. There were a few surprises here and there as well."
5," Terrible dialogue and awful script
",ryanwinning1,/user/ur54433040/,3 December 2022,"There was a lot of great things about the film: the costumes were great and everything about Wakanda Forever was visually stunning. Easily the most realistic under water scenes I've ever seen in a movie to date. The fight scenes were awesome, but as soon as it was time for them to act or have dialogue it was super cringe. The namor scenes were great but anything that didn't have Namor in it could have put me right to sleep. I mean it's not just that it's probably the most ""woke"" movie ever made to date. The actors are just really really bad. I really hope they don't try to make a spin off movie with the girl who's somehow the greatest scientist on the planet now replacing Tony Stark as Iron(Wo)man, but you know they're gonna try! Anyways visually stunning but terrible script and dialogue!"
," Boring!!!
",mg-231645,/user/ur112107413/,3 December 2022,"The story is not quite good, most of the scenes is lacking. Namor's design is far from the comics, but his scenes fits to the plot of the film. Shuri as a black panther did a great job in acting, but there are some scenes which is little bit messy. The CGI/VFX is bad and some are unfinished. Action scenes are the only scenes which are okay and it delivers a character sequences on the film. The post-credit scene is not exciting and it was way too soon for this character.The first black panther movie is still the best, in terms of character development and plot, but this one is not.Overall it was totally boring 2/10."
10," Respect for King T'Challa
",Kevinzo,/user/ur72170406/,3 December 2022,"The film is amazing and the due respect has given to the King, Chadwick Boseman. All the actors are doing their best and I must say Angela Bassett is doing her job very well. One of the best Marvel movies and the film was so colorful. The costume designing is also good and the production team has done a great job too. When Chadwick was shown the whole cinema hall was in pin drop silence. It is so emotional to be honest and the starting and ending scenes made the hall silent. The ending scene was speechless and no one will ever imagine such an ending for Wakanda Forever. I wish Ryan Coogler and the team all the very best. Hats off!"
9," It's perfect but I gave it a 9 because my cat is sick
",mnaabtnlove,/user/ur156300560/,3 December 2022,"Nah fr this is a great movie, one of the best in phase 4 that's for sure and problem is the movie too long and that's it because everything was just great and I thought they were gonna overuse Chadwick's death and they didn't even include him that much and that's a great sign, rip the legend but the movie needed to shine without him and it did, and guy pray for my cat am not sleeping just watching him until now 7:18am right now and I never slept, and yeah movie is great and the cinematography is phenomenal and namor is badass and they dud him justice hope they give thia treatment to hulk someday."
8," A drama in superhero wrapping
",nvfone,/user/ur20021144/,2 December 2022,"I remember when Captain America 2 first came out and we where all astounded that a superhero movie could work when it's really a spy movie. Black Panther 2 is similar, except this time it's actually a drama.Not everyone likes that, I get that, but for me it was excellent. The drama is deep and powerful and left me incredibly reflective and somber (in a good way). The music is absolutely masterful although it jumps genres maybe a bit too much. I think it could have been better if it wasn't just a catalogue of international music but rather something a bit more focused. But the music that was on showcase was excellent.The hand-to-hand combat scenes were piss poor, I took off half a point for that. And they introduce yet another hero and want us to care about them without giving us a single reason to care. Why does Disney keep writing garbage like this? I took off another half a point for that because she's not actually that major of a character in the movie (or it would have been a whole point).But I did take off a whole point for the overly dark night scenes. There where a lot of them and they were all so dark that it was almost impossible to make out what was going on, let alone see any details. There is no excuse for such bad editing in a Disney production.But those criticisms where completely forgotten by the end of the film. I was riveted and in tears and applauding and I totally fell in love with Angela Basset. Maybe the script didn't shine as much as it could have, but this cast made it shine. Every single performance was excellent.Thanks for salvaging phase four for me, Disney. Seriously, I have hated everything else in this phase and I didn't even both watching Thor. But if you can do more of this caliber, I will return to watching them 2 or 3 times in the theaters like I used to in the golden days of phases 1-3."
10," This movie might be my favourite movie EVER!!!
",johannesfaerseth,/user/ur159117434/,2 December 2022,"It's perfect. It balances out Chadwick's tragic passing and continue the story of wakanda. It introduces namor perfectly, he's a perfect character and has a good reason to do what he has to do. He just wants to protect his people and he can go from being funny and friendly to threatening you and your people. Everyone has a great storyline, I love shuri as the new black panther and has the killmonger style and anger. Okoye is amazing gets fired and then gets a sick suit. Also m'baku is so good he's funny and Sirius. I love when wakanda gets flooded and they all have to move to the mountains to m'baku's tribe. And iron heart is great she doesn't steel the movie from other characters but is a very fun addition to it and makes it better. I don't like when people say that this movie would be better 30-20 minutes shorter but what can you cut out, nothing. It's perfect length and I'm so happy that there is another long marvel movie. This movie didn't even feel long.This movie is emotional funny, exciting and fun. 10/10."
7," Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Review
",theredsky,/user/ur101697549/,2 December 2022,"Phase 4 of the MCU really isn't that great in my opinion bar Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home but the writing for both of those is very weak at points. Wakanda Forever however stands way above the rest of Phase 4 and I'm really happy that Phase 4 ended this way. This film is an improvement over the first film in my opinion in almost every aspect. The visual effects while still off look better than the PS2 effects of the first movie. The characters here are all very well written and incredibly well acted. Angela Bassett gives probably one of the best performances in the entire series here and Letitia Wright does an amazing job as well. Wright probably has one of the best character arcs in the MCU as well. Watching her learn to process her grief over the death of her brother is heartbreaking. Her arc feels a lot more personal as does most of the rest of this film. To address the obvious, Chadwick Boseman's presence here is sorely missed but the film does an absolutly beautiful job at handling this. The film not really respects the character of T'Challa but also Chadwick as well. The first 10 minutes and last 5 address his departure and those last 5 minutes caused me to start crying. Tenoch Huerta does a great job as well and plays a great antagonist here although I do prefer Killmonger. Namor has an understandable motivation of protecting his people from being found on although he goes about it through the wrong way of attacking Wakanda. I struggle to call Namor a villain nor an anti-hero because of his motivation and his intentions to try and make peace at first. Ryan Coogler once again proves that he is easily one of the best directors in the MCU and the film just looks absolutely gorgeous. Easily one of the best looking films in the MCU and one of the best sounding. Ludwig GÃ¶ransson's score is once again great although the music from the first film is just a little bit better. I did have some minor issues with the film though. I already mentioned the visual effects but the pacing here is definitely off. The first act (minus the first 10 minutes) speeds through everything before finally slowing down and the humor when it is used only works about 50% of the time although I do really like that this film MAJORLY cuts back on the typical MCU comedy. This is very easily one of the best entries in the MCU and I would definitely recommend watching this when you get the chance."
1," Disney really is messing up
",iowaimportracer,/user/ur79275047/,2 December 2022,"The literal stories are already written, all you have to do is put them on the big screen. Ever since Disney bought Marvel they have messed up everything. Between the women empowerment and making all male characters dumb as a box of rocks, Namor is from Atlantis and is not Mayan or Aztec and is also mutant. How do you screw up stories so bad that are already written.Not just that but how does black panthers mom all the sudden get the throne? He had to fight for it against Unbaka. She just inherited it without a fight. The whole story is bogus and depressing to even watch. Sad to see great stories end up like this."
2," 2 long, 2 boring, bad CGI and bad ""action""
",klown013,/user/ur15983902/,2 December 2022,"1. Movie should have been at least 45 minutes shorter
2. Acting was terrible with a few exceptions- Winston Duke and Angela Bassett both did great. Letitia Wright, Dominique Thorne and the rest were all over the place. Too emotional or barely any acting.3. Iron Heart was incredibly lame as a character and as a part of the story. Apprently Tony Stark was not a genius considering every charactor in the MCU is able to create the same things he did. Half the characters in this movie have their won armor, super labs and / or figured out Vibraniun, AI and super soldier level serums.4. As everyone else mentioned, the inclusion of the Ross and Valentina characters was a huge mistake and dragged an already long and boring film even more.5. Namor was terrible. Actor was ok, this version of the character had no personality, no charm, no charisma and none of the a-hole traits that make up Namor all together. Awful, awful version of this character. Also, said to be as strong as the Hulk, but has to dodge bullets, can't fly through enemy fighter crafts? Has to consistently grab the thing and try to throw it? Gets beaten by a Black Panther that has like 5 minutes of fighting experience? CHUMP!6. The CGI is, once again, terrible. Aquatic animals look awful, characters jumping on and off them look like a video game glitch, Planes (jets? Whatever the aircraft fighters are called) lack dimension and basically looked like a pre-render version someone forgot to complete.7. Wakanda is land locked. Except, it isn't and this is never explained.8. Wakanda is supposed to be the most advanced nation on Earth but they get destroyed by a bunch of fish people using stone age weapons and no technology.9. This movie brings lazy, non-consistent writing and story telling to a whole new lever for MCU. One of the worst movies of the year."
5," Mundane and predictable
",david-hbsn,/user/ur33788676/,2 December 2022,"There was so much in this movie I wanted to like, but somehow it just didn't click. Some absurd directorial choices make me disconnect from the movie and key points, breaking the spell that should keep one bound to the credits.Also, the new genius child Riri spends most of the movie less than useless and freaking out, offering zero help or brilliance. And this character is so randomly thrust into the story without the marvel secret sauce that has made so many previous new character entrants so successful - backstory.M'Baku and Okoye were the standouts for me in this movie and I think a FAR cooler twist would have been for Okoye to be made black panther, as she is really the most suited as the existing tip of the spear and primary guardian of Wakanda.Ultimately the script was far to predicable and convenient to make this anything more than a below average movie with some cool expensive CGI."
1," I was disappointed and I really wanted to like it so much
",angelovasimona-56370,/user/ur156858390/,2 December 2022,"By the end of the movie I was forcing myself to like it, I wanted to like it so much. I was super excited for the movie and looking forward to it, but what the heck was this. Almost 3 hours of film, during which every half hour I wanted to leave the hall. They didn't honor Chadwick's death very well at first. Second, almost the entire film revolves around the mother-daughter drama, in the middle of the film a mermaid appears and flies in the air with fins on its legs. There were references to Avatar and Transformers fighting on a ship. And finally the new black panther which had a screen time of 10 minutes. I don't recommend watching this movie in theaters, but if you want to cringe and lose some of your life, you might want to give it a shot from your couch."
8," Coogler did it again
",Archandutta-89132,/user/ur159433845/,2 December 2022,"Positive : 1) Ryan Coogler is one of the most promising director of recent time . His direction is top notch in whole film especially in emotional scenes . 2) Now i have to mention about story . Despite the loss of Boseman how they pull of the story was very impressive .3) Ruth. E Carter has done a great job in costume design one more time . 4) cinematography is also very good . 5) In acting department all are done very good job but i have to mention Angela Bassett and Tenoch Huerta , they are just brilliant in this film . 6) namor character is decently established . 7) the contradiction between logic, science and tradition , belief was really good 8) In most of the part action is also good , it is designed according to everyone ability . How namor was flying was well designed negative : 1) i think last action scene could be better , there could be more goosebump moments . So over all if you are typical marvel fan and go only for action then you may not like this film but if you are a cine lover and have patience then you should go for it ."
5," Lacklustre sequel missing Chadwick Boseman
",tm-sheehan,/user/ur25552762/,2 December 2022,"My Review- Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022)
My Rating 5/10I really enjoyed the original Black Panther and gave it a resounding 9/10 but as often happens with sequels , they usually fail . Especially sequels without its original charismatic hero in this case Chadwick Boseman who played King T'Challa.Of course if Chadwick Boseman had still been alive I'm certain that he would have repeated his famous role and the script would have been better for it.Wakanda Forever commences with the funeral and mourning for T'Challa and then descends into cliche after cliche and unlike the original lacks any originality in my opinion.We have the kidnapping T'Challa's sister Princess Shuri and heir to the throne of Wakanda by one of the most lacklustre villains I've seen in a while named Namor .Namor is an aquatic man who literally flys down the street with wings on his feet.Perhaps under the sea is a new wave in SciFi fantasy with Avatar The Way of Water due out this month I hope that sequel is better than this one.British actor Martin Freeman plays only stands out because he is one of the few caucasian white actors in the film not for his performance as Everett Ross he could have Zoomed his role in as it's just silly.I think just keep it to the 2 fantasy Kingdoms and leave Earth out of it as we're in such a mess of our own .Then of course there's the obligatory battle of two civilisations fighting for the ""precious "" in this case a valuable commodity called Vibranium so it's a no brainer why Vibranium is so valuable?I left before the ending of this 2 hour 41 minute mind numbing overlong saga without really being interested who won the war as not one character really interested me .You can have the best CGI technology and it's impressive in Black Panther Wakander Forever but if you don't have a great screenplay or characters that resonate with your audience it's not a pleasant viewing experience in my view."
8," Enjoyed this film a lot, Shuri slander has no place in this world.
",gealliangrace,/user/ur159408936/,1 December 2022,"If everybody just listened to shuri and allowed her to take the reigns from the beginning, wakanda and talokan would have been besties. That said, absolutely loved that the story is driven from the consequences of the major characters' decisions.The casts really delivered great performance and I am especially taken with Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, and Tenoch Huerta's performances.The CGI was solid except for the last few bits near the end.Overall, emotionally gripping and a great tribute for Chadwick Boseman. Might not be others' cup of tea as it is slow paced and has less action/battle scenes compared to other MCU films but works for people like me who is more invested in plot progression through each character's individual growth and their connection with one another.Great directorship by Ryan Coogler."
7," The opinion of Marvel lover.
",netjes-68621,/user/ur118073406/,1 December 2022,". Not just MCU but whole marvel stuff is precious to me in terms of being part of my childhood. My awareness of rules and roots of the sup's world is not always helpful while watching MCU. But speaking about this movie - there is something else to talk about.Starting with director and passing straight to cast I got confused by something I didn't recognize to be true when watching previous movies about Black Panther ( there's two more). As a person who had seen all the interviews for press tour and premier as well as hearing comments of Kevin Feige on making of the film I got the idea - filming process to be more of a group work then achievement of one particular actor\actress. Through all supporting material it is visible that no one turned to try to be ' bigger' then other. As a result - family energy is wholesome, actors are giving head up to each other's talent without being suppressed by one's previous acting works.On screen job is impeccable talking about Angela Basset and Lupita Nyong'o. The first is just a huge figure in this film and through all franchise as a mother of King and whole Wakanda. The energy of love, tenderness but flows around her up until it to defend the homeland. Nakia is in fact already taking up a place of Quin with heart open speeches and same dedication to the place she ' s been born to. Both actress's made a bunch of work to show how strong women can lead in grief.Man's side of the film is all about Namor. The first , mean, masculine -that is what I expected knowing him from comics. What I really get disappointed me in any way. Honestly, I grew not to be fan of choosing Tenoch Huerta. My fear of not been comfortable with seeing such a different choice from comic variant. As soon as he appeared on-screen the feeling of wrong choice disappeared, for except one scene about Namor's childhood witch just wasn't filmed good. Summing up - charisma of mr. Huerta is great deal and I am looking forward to see him more in the Cinematic Universe.Martin Freeman's appearance brings cozy vibes to the film of coolness. Winston Duke is a pure gold in terms of silly and strong leader. My gut tells me that there will be love line between him and Shuri.Talking about grief - this was honorable ' Goodbye' to Chadwick Boseman. I would rather call it ' saying aloud all the thinks witch we ought have said but wasn't made it on time' hoping that he'll watch from up above. I guess this is the best page closing up for an era of this Black Panther to give the way to progress in future. Have no clue what next phase of MCU will be for this hero but the way is clear and me personally ready to percept whatever is coming."
2," Nearly A Walk Out of the Theater Bad Sequel!
",jdjj-80425,/user/ur80468970/,1 December 2022,"Wakanda Forever had many gaps & was centered around the rituals for too long rather than using that time to better support the storyline itself. The 1st movie though had a good balance and the story was great! The decent acting performances in Wakanda Forever (in particular Namor, Ramonda, M'Baku and Okoye) were wasted by an incredibly poor script for the Riri character! I felt like the primary focus of the movie became lost as the movie progressed after a very slow and boring start which could have been forgiven if the storyline didn't continue to worsen. The 1st Black Panther movie was amazing, but Wakanda Forever was an utter disappointment! I'd regret watching this movie if it was completely free! I have never seen such a horrible Marvel film in my lifetime! The action scenes saved me from walking out of the theater! I'm judging this movie for what it is & not the unfortunate tragedy of the main character's before the sequel was filmed."
10," Much better than expected, Talocan is great
",scubistacy,/user/ur156006830/,1 December 2022,"I had two worries about this movie - how will they handle the passing of its star Chadwick Boseman, and how will they present Namor and his underwater kingdom. In my opinion, they did a great job in regard to both topics.The movie had some weak points, but not enough for me to give it a rating less then 10 - because the good sides have been mind-blowing.Shuris vision with Killmonger in it, before she has another one with her mother. The stellar performances of Angela Bassett and Tenoch Huerta deserve recognition. The amount of detail they put in fleshing out Talocan and the references to Maya culture found in there (like this ball game the people are playing in one scene). The word ""mutant"" finally being used in a MCU movie. My husband is a diver who has spent quite a lot of time in Yucatan, which I have also visited, and we have been both impressed by Talocan - and he himself specifically how realistic it was compared to the Atlantis from DC. Sorry Jason Momoa, but Marvel got it better. And I don't see resemblances to the new Avatar besides having ""blue people"" in there. If people complain about that - in my regard, Avatar has borrowed heavily from the 2nd expansion of World of Warcraft (Zangarmarsh anyone) and its Troll peoples. If Cameron gets away with that, then Marvel should get a pass as well.They made some changes in Namors backstory and personality, but it seemed plausible to me regarding the whole framework of the setting. I even like this interpretation of the character more than the comic version.And of course, the great soundtrack. I love the integration of synth sound elements in Shuris theme. Its a great audio definition of her character. I also liked that they have separated the hero Black Panther from the ruler of Wakanda. It gives them more freedom for the Black Panther character.For me it was the best movie of MCU phase IV."
7," Kinda long...like this review
",Wingzzz,/user/ur68252316/,1 December 2022,"I felt that the passing of both Chadwick and T'Challa loomed LARGE over this movie. It's just not the same without him and I understand it's a huge challenge to accommodate the tragic loss so I will give Coogler and co. Credit for that.One issue was I felt a lack of character development or nuance. I understand there's themes of grief and loss, but I felt they weren't fully explored here. The last minute set up of choosing vengeance vs justice basically just wasn't quite enough for me to feel like Shuri 'earned it'. I will say that Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett and everyone for that matter turned in very powerful performances! Another thing that really bothered me was the lack of screen time for some of the key players in Wakanda. Okoye is my favorite and she just disappears from the movie eventually. Mbaku has nothing to do and is very wasted. In my opinion there were two characters that felt interjected and unnecessary. I don't mind Agent Ross but his role in this movie felt forced in just because he was in the first movie. The other was RiRi and I just did not enjoy this character, I'm sorry. Similar to America Chavez in Dr. Strange her role comes down to essentially a needless plot device that felt interjected into a big movie because they're lesser known characters. They're not endearing and they detract from the people we care about seeing. I do think that in general this movie feels long winded and starts to wear thin in certain places. Maybe I've just become numb to the MCU but some of the story just didnt impact like I believe it was intended too(the Chadwick memorial definitely did...RIP).I really liked Namor and his people. They were kind of creepy with their siren like singing and I really dug that. I like the change in lore to root his origins in ancient Aztec culture. I think it makes perfect sense. Namor had a presence and a gravitas that I really liked. I'm honestly relieved and surprised they didn't kill him off because Marvel stays killing off their better villains! The music was very good throughout. Some of the action was pretty solid and enjoyable, although I felt the final battle was a bit rushed. The costume/wardrobe and hair and makeup was all fantastic and beautiful. The visuals were mostly good. The movie was coherent enough and didn't have an over abundance of corny jokes. There's certainly a lot to like."
10," great film
",Soheilsabet,/user/ur159210516/,1 December 2022,"Phase 4's MCU comes to a close with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. It's been a truly inconsistent run of films. There was the good (Shang-Chi, Spider-Man, some of Dr. Strange 2), the eh (other parts of Dr. Strange 2, Black Widow and Eternals), and the ugly (Thor 4, which is easily the worst MCU movie so far). If this movie had been bad, it might have been enough to make me bail on keeping up with the MCU's movies, and truth be told, I've already bailed on the Disney+ series', because WandaVision, Falcon & Winter Soldier, and Loki really didn't do it for me. I love marvel i love all film from marvel."

",peteraziz-62256,/user/ur97198546/,1 December 2022,"Final review: 6/10The sequel to the blockbuster black panther did well and was above average. Great performances from the actress playing shuri and the queen. Of course M'baku is the star and gem of the movie!!Costumes, sets, script and tone were all great. Just found it floppy when it came to sequencing of scenes and the plot.Everything about the water people was great and very well done.Can't quite say if a better film or not than black Adam but again two different universes and an answer I probably won't give.Kudos to both on producing entertaining films.Again, rip to the legend. No one can ever outdo his performance but I look forward to seeing what the future of the franchise looks like."
10," A beautiful cinematic experience
",littlegb2800,/user/ur22617721/,30 November 2022,"This movie was beautifully executed. The effects were amazing and the plot was great. The back story with Namor was thorough and I loved his and Shuri's character development. The tribute to T'Challa/Chadwick Bozeman was beautiful, I love how they memorialized him. The realistic depiction of how grief affects people differently was beautiful. I also loved how M'Baku served as an adviser of sorts to Shuri. I loved the character development in the film. The alliance that Shuri eventually formed with Namor made sense especially since both Tolokan and Wakanda are the only places vibranium was found. This was an overall amazing film and I enjoyed it."
3," How can a sequel be full? Well it can
",spamalot-92429,/user/ur81859504/,30 November 2022,"The first two hours are mostly setting up who is who, relationships and tribal ceremonies. The protracted set up of a new Marvel film character is not unusual (Dr Strange, Iron Man, etc) but usually interesting. This is neither interesting nor fun. Then it becomes ""Pandora"" for a chunk. All the action and resolution of matters is in the last 30 minutes except for the tribute scenes at the end. And why was the Martin Freeman part even included? It had little to do with the story. Very unhappy with a Marvel film which usually does not happen. I know I'm not enjoying a film when I try to see my watch. I was checking 45 minutes in."
8," Breath of fresh air for marvel
",anthonyratuis,/user/ur137728303/,30 November 2022,"In the midst of my marvel fatigue, I really enjoyed this film. I thought namor was great and the film was very respectful of Chadwick Boseman.Given the circumstances, the film carries a ton of emotional weight, and from that aspect it is executed perfectly. But they don't tiptoe around it and sacrifice good story telling. The protagonist is put into a complex moral dilemma that mirrors that of the first film and I enjoyed the continued exploration of that idea.Overall, I was looking for something fresh coming off of years of subpar marvel projects too concerned with building the universe rather than making a great film, and this exceeded my expectations. Although it is long and drags a little at certain points, I felt very good walking out of the theater."
8," A WORTHY FOLLOW-UP...!
",masonfisk,/user/ur8062935/,30 November 2022,"The latest in the MCU & probably the most well realized yarn this year from Marvel currently playing in theaters. Unfortunately since the passing of Chadwick Boseman, the cinematic elephant in the room before the film's release was how're they going to handle his passing since a recasting of the role was going to be considered an affront to Boseman's memory so dealing w/his character's passing, a sudden ailment which his sister Letitia Wright's brilliant scientist can't solve proves an ample subplot for her to deal w/his death since Wakanda needs a Panther & the flowers which create the hero were destroyed by Killmonger, Michael B. Jordan, in the last entry putting us in a place where scientific might may not trump tradition. Adding to the drama is the world's attempts to usurp Wakanda's hold on vibranium, the appearance of the mutant Namor (masterfully now rooted in Aztec mythology) who fears land dwellers will come to his kingdom seeking the powerful ore & also ReRe Williams, Dominque Thorne, a young genius following in the footsteps of Tony Stark, who's constructed a vibranium detector which has been co-opted by the American government which puts her on a death list penned by Namor. All of this climaxes on a troop barge where the seemingly insurmountable ocean dwellers are spurred back from the remaining Wakandan forces (after a flooding decimates the nation) where a Black Panther stands tall once again to not only right some wrongs but keep the world in their respective corners. Ryan Coogler again proves himself to be the biggest kid on the cinematic block by weaving a nearly 3 hour narrative into something thoughtful, inspiring & ultimately soul searching as viewers grapple w/the multitude of emotions being explored here."
4," Long movie with off pacing
",csmaros,/user/ur84001804/,30 November 2022,"In that it's similar to Eternals, but even more drawn out. The theme is one of a nation (and people) mourning but it never really hit home. It was so slow and drawn out by the time the action bits happened they too seemed forced.Without spoiling it, if you're a comic book fan you're almost guaranteed to lose it if you're going in blind as once things were unveiled, all I could think was: ""Oh wow, we're doing this?"" It was definitely an experimental way to handle things. For non-readers, this will not matter.As movie-goers may walk in thinking, losing Chadwick Boseman might indeed be fatal to this particular franchise.Final rating: 4. In IMDBland, six (6) seems to be a base on watchable. Five (5) would be slightly off, this was a four (4) as I'm good with never seeing this again."
10," Finally a good movie
",adresalabuleala,/user/ur151320000/,29 November 2022,"I had no good expectations when I watched it. I was already disappointed by latest marvel movies and I expected another failure, but to my surprise it was good. I really enjoyed it. It's definitely a good movie, and by comparison with Thor: Love and Thunder or Morbius it's a masterpice. No stupid jokes, memes or complete idiotic reactions, just action, epic battle, relativly sober atmosfere, appropriate given by the circumstances. I wish that marvel will continue to make more movies like this and less meme checks and references to internet culture colections. Jokes are funny when used with moderation, otherewise the entire movie become just a joke."
6," Pretty alright Marvel film
",hakuthedragon,/user/ur157951094/,29 November 2022,"Just watched the film in theatres. I'd say it was a pretty alright Marvel film - standard, enjoyable, but definitely pales in comparison to the first Black Panther.I enjoyed the overall story, it's nothing mind-blowing, just the average Marvel film. I thought the VFX were great and the new country of people introduced are quite unique; their underwater world looked amazing. The fight scenes were OK.I didn't quite like the character design. Namor (who some characters call Nay-mor when I thought it was pronounced Nah-mor?), sort of just wears briefs all the time, which is understandable I guess. The two new suits that are worn by Riri and Okoye were just ugly to me. It was giving Power Ranger and Abe Sapien with a mane. I did like Shuri's suit that incorporates silver and gold, and the outfits worn by the Talocan warriors look pretty badass.In typical Marvel fashion, the villain and the hero's lives will have some sort of parallel that makes them more empathetic etcetc. In Namor and Shuri's case, I felt that the similarities that were being drawn between the two were kind of heavy handed/unnecessary, won't get into spoilers but yeah. Somehow I just couldn't empathise with Namor as much as I did with Killmonger.I felt like some plot points were unnecessary and seemed shoehorned in to give Shuri more trauma to speed up her character development, lol.As a whole though, it was an enjoyable experience. The soundtrack is great too (though the first Black Panther soundtrack remains undefeated), I was bumping to the Burna Boy song when it came on. Wakanda Forever is overall a pretty decent film, but I wouldn't rewatch it again like I would the first."
8," Pretty great!
",parkermiddletonkersey,/user/ur159345404/,29 November 2022,"I love the use of the characters in this movie and as well as the new ones. They introduced Namor, Namora, Atuma, and the other villains spectacularly. I love Namor's motive to destroy the land just for his people. The fight scenes were ðŸ”¥! It was also emotional seeing Shuri push through the loss of her brother and mother throughout the movie. Although I wish Okoye was the new Black Panther, Shuri was a great Black Panther. Helping the emotional aspect of the movie was Rihanna's new song ""Lift me up"" which was a great addition to the movie. So overall the movie was great but just a few little things brought it down to an 8."
6," I fell asleep multiple times
",johnallred,/user/ur99982785/,29 November 2022,"This movie had so many slow parts. I kept falling asleep. This is very unusual for me. Unfortunately, it just could not keep my attention. It was nowhere near as good as the first Black Panther movie. I appreciate that they were trying to be respectful toward Chadwick Boseman, but I think they overdid it. Also, Martin Freeman's role in this movie was... odd. It felt shoehorned in as a touchstone to the previous Black Panther movie. Finally, I'm not sure how they are going to redeem Namor. He came off as a true villain and wasn't redeemed at all. Is the plan to have him continue to be a villain going forward?"
7," Only if we had left expectation at the door!
",NestorTheGreat,/user/ur54687345/,29 November 2022,"Felt more Avatar 2 than Star Wars, a lot less Marvel-like, more Ben-Hur-ish epic than a sequel. And none of that is a bad thing in itself. Put altogether, though? A lot to take in after just one viewing.The story flowed along at such a pace I didn't even go to the toilet throughout the two hours and forty minutes of the silver screen spectacle!New characters, new gadgets, new villians and/or antiheroes, new locations and a different beat to tell the obligatory dark Part Two of the trilogy playbook. There's a lot to unpack. And emotions need to stabilize before delving any deeper.A more emotional film than an action one. Bigger action without the fear of losing a favourite character, as this film introduces different sides of previously seen characters, and brand new ones, without the depth and scope previous origin movies gave certain heroes. An altogether enjoyable experience, if only we left expectation at the door!"
4," Feels like the stories are getting more and more pointless
",tuchowskijan,/user/ur94296850/,29 November 2022,"While fights and special effects are very good if not great, as in most marvel movies, I feel that with every movie, and they produce like two thousand a week it seems, the stories are getting more and more pointless. There's no sense, no emotions, no tension building, no character development, there's literaly nothing to like the movie for, other than a few moments of average jokes, nice tracks, effects and actors. An example: (SPOILER-ish KIND OF) the new black panther is just a girl princess, they call her that. Then she takes some miracle leaf drug and after a pointless vision she's a superhero. I mean, where's any tension, fight, character development, story progression? I get it, it's Marvel, it's comic books adaptations, nobody expects realism, but there should be some merit to all that. It looks like a never ending chain of pathetic conversations and totally random events that have no logical connection to the next one. Reheated burger."
6," Its Not Great
",mattclap28,/user/ur15429412/,28 November 2022,"You'll be forgiven if you feel conflicted after watching Wakanda Forever. Its not terrible, but its definitely underwhelming. The story starts but never really goes anywhere, then when it does its like oh ok. It's also overly long for what it's trying to achieve.As the Wakandans move on from King T'Challa's passing, they must unite with Nakia and Everett Ross to forge a new path for their kingdom's future.It must be said the film gives a heartbreaking tribute to Chadwick Boseman. The actors show genuine grief, giving the moment truth and sincerity. Overall dont go in expecting this film to blow your mind, you'll be disappointed."
8," An impressive second movie.
",Sleepin_Dragon,/user/ur15311310/,28 November 2022,"The King of Wakanda is dead, and its people face a new threat.If I'm honest, I have to say I wasn't captivated by the first movie, despite the gorgeous visuals and incredible acting, Wakanda forever however, this was a completely different story, I thoroughly enjoyed it. For me, it felt as though The Wakandans had a worthy adversary here, it was a real twist.First off, I loved the way it paid tribute to Chadwick Boseman, the credits were a truly nice touch, his tragic passing was very sensitively dealt with.High energy, action packed, this truly was a visual masterpiece, the production team absolutely nailed it. Great music also, it worked with the film, it never clashed with it, or felt overdone.The acting was quite something, terrific in every corner, two powerhouse performances stood out for me though, Laetitia Wright and Tenoch Huerta, the pair were just incredible, their scenes together were captivating.Really enjoyed it, 8/10."
7," Wright Seizes The Lead Role
",deepfrieddodo,/user/ur123203865/,28 November 2022,"Given the untimely death of Chadwick Boseman, the Black Panther sequel was always going to have additional hurdles to overcome for a successful and enjoyable film. Wakanda Forever's long runtime certainly ebbs and flows, stuttering at times but ultimately building to a thoroughly enjoyable climax. Wright deserves absolute credit for picking up the lead role in the same (previously supporting) character.The plot explains changes seamlessly, without being perfect. The opening 'tribute' scenes aren't too befitting and seem off, but once the introduction of foes come into play, the environment allows recognition of the King's passing as context without withholding the plot from advancing.Namor is a very exciting character to introduce into the MCU, and Huerta grows into the role as the film progresses. Having 'Atlantis' scrapped and replaced by Talokan for fears of confusion with the likes of DC's Aquaman appears weak on Marvel's part though. The appearance of its inhabitants are a little underwhelming too, one of Marvel Comic's first heroes certainly deserved a greater introduction and appearance.Furthermore, Marvel now seemingly jump to a super suit of armour at every opportunity, which adds nothing interesting to the story, and this is the case here. Ironheart does not contribute positively to the plot, the suit itself looks poor due to the MCU's slipping CGI standards, and having just anyone with the ability to create advanced weapons in the style of Iron Man not only piggybacks, but also lessens, the quality of one of the universe's most popular character, Tony Stark.Choreography is impressive, chemistry between characters works well, dialogue solid and overall is more enjoyable than its predecessor."
8," Shuri's Time to Shine
",chloeurc,/user/ur33765354/,28 November 2022,"Black Panther Wakanda Forever rating :
7.5/10I liked it more than I thought I would. The Chadwick Boseman tribute was really nice and the end had a great twist not seen at all in the trailers. The movie was two hours and forty minutes but didn't feel like it actually. The villain was meh and Ironheart was meh for me as well but I really liked Shuri in this, it was her time to shine and she really had some fantastic character development. Okoye too. Angela Bassett (the mother) could literally be nominated for an Oscar for this role and I wouldn't be surprised. Best acting in the film and one of the best actors the MCU has. A cool cameo was added in as well! A few remarks and moments seemed a little politically motivated by Hollywood but other than that the movie was nice!"
6," More Namor Origin Story than Black Panther 2
",philippjauch,/user/ur59858723/,28 November 2022,The movie is building up quite nicely. I have to confess I had higher expectations what would happen to the end.I don't want to spoil the details. After the credits rolled through it felt for me more like Namor's origin story. So the MCU now hast this god inbetween hero and antagonist.The Black Panther story was mostly about grief. That topic they nail to the point. And yes. There is this threat hanging with war but the logical errors are too big to make this setup believable. Despite some good dialogue. But I felt that the dialogue isn't reflecting the situation we are introduced and walked through.Namor was better than expected. Besides I really don't like his flappy feet. But the way they created the feeling for the way he moves rapidly like a hummingbird and builds up momentum was cool. Also his motivation is understandable. But then... Too fast with his actions.And then there is this very big logic hole in the first third.I also raised my eyebrows more than once with the CGI costumes/armors. This was looking a little bit too much like Power Rangers. Like they didn't really finished the CGI and it was too bland.I also wouldn't call that movie bad. It's okay. But for me there was a big junk missing.
10," Excellent tribute and storyline full of substance.
",willwilborn69,/user/ur58066097/,28 November 2022,"This follow-up to the original Black Panther did not disappoint.It was great inspite of the heavy expectations created by the success of the first one and the difficult task of delivery without disrespect due to the heartbreaking and untimely passing of Chadwick Boseman.The development team did an excellent job creating a story line with a very rich plot, plenty of drama, introductions of new characters, and a very heartwarming tribute.They even managed to throw in a few surprises that built up anticipation for the 3rd installment.If you enjoy this genre with an unbiased heart, you will love this 2nd installment.The negative reviews must be by people who either haven't seen the movie or just don't like or appreciate the Black Panther franchise for some artistically unrelated reasons.Watch the movie.You will be glad you did."
7," Enjoyable, but a little too long!
",laura-24027,/user/ur107744267/,28 November 2022,"Firstly, I did enjoy this movie. I think the cast & crew did a great job, considering the loss of Chadwick Boseman, & the subsequent dilemma of how to proceed. The tribute to him was lovely, the acting was good, & the costumes were beautiful.I loved Shuri in the first movie, but she was so much more serious in this one (understandably so), & I don't think she should have become Black Panther, especially since she obviously had no desire to rule. M'Baku would have made a fantastic Black Panther /king) & Shuri could have continued as tech support! M'Baku at least, could already fight, but it seemed false that Shuri suddenly had all these fighting skills when she became Black Panther. (Strength & agility, yes)
Does that end scene mean M'Baku will take over as king/ Black Panther? ðŸ¤”I love the idea of another hidden nation & an alliance between Wakanda & the underwater city, & Namor was great, although I don't understand how his little ankle wings helped him fly!So, overall, an enjoyable movie, although very long - I will watch it again when it comes to steaming."
6," A very bold but fairly underwhelming, slow, and bloated Marvel project.
",frankiesilver-91836,/user/ur120447312/,27 November 2022,"I never thought the original Black Panther was anywhere near being the best solo Marvel movie, but I did enjoy it and T'Challa's character throughout his appearances. With that being said, when Chadwick Boseman sadly passed, I accepted that this franchise was doomed. I always believed that recasting T'Challa was the only way to go. It would've been incredibly hard to find a good replacement, but the character is very important to the Marvel universe. It is also simply too soon to pass the mantle of Black Panther on. When they confirmed he wouldn't be recast, I felt like it was a big mistake narratively.Now does Wakanda Forever handle the death of T'Challa/Boseman well? Absolutely! Being able to respect the legacy of the actor while also metatextually connecting the event to an in-universe tragedy is definitely one of the movie's standout features. Regardless, I feel like the movie is a little too reliant on the audience being impacted by Boseman's passing.Don't get me wrong, the fully silent opening gave me chills. They incorporated the death beautifully and honorably, but the result is what feels like two movies in one. You can clearly tell the original script was written before Chadwick's death. I really respect Coogler's decision to not recast, but I still wish T'Challa and Namor got to cross paths.My issues spring not from the T'Challa-related parts of the film, but from how the rest feels lacking without his presence. I don't think Shuri works as the protagonist. She was a fun (yet underdeveloped) carefree tech nerd in the original movie and here she takes a 180 to being reserved and bitter. The changes to her character were perhaps necessary for this story, but it doesn't make them good changes for her. Some don't match her at all and her vengeful arc is just T'Challa's from Civil War with a less fitting character. She never struck me as someone who would willingly become the Black Panther and there isn't much impact when she does anyway.Ramonda is a pleasant surprise in this movie. Her monologues are insane. Angela Bassett deserves all the credit she's been receiving. However, Okoye is the only character I felt really connected to and she is stupidly sidelined a third into the movie. She would've enhanced the film a lot if given more screen time. So would've M'Baku, who is completely wasted. Between them and W'Kabi, who is fully absent, we have three characters connected to T'Challa and it isn't explored how his death affected any of them personally. This is one of many missed opportunities that came with trying to focus the movie on both Talokan and T'Challa's death.Some of the action scenes are awesome and some drag. As to be expected from Danai Gurira, Okoye's fight scenes are the tensest we've gotten from Marvel all year.Namor himself is a pretty good villain. In a similar fashion to Killmonger, his actor sells the character for me despite his viewpoints being completely ridiculous. They somehow managed to adapt his crazy mutant powers to live-action in a cool way. Changing his kingdom from Atlantis to Talokan ended up being a really cool idea, even though the place and its people needed more elaboration. There are many more cool concepts they could've explored with the Aztec roots. Hopefully they are saving more about the civilization, the people's powers, and their technology for a Namor project.Ironheart is an even more underdeveloped part of the movie, undoubtedly to save content for her upcoming show. Her character is just as dumb and not relatable as I expected her to be and her suit looks awful. A Black Panther movie didn't feel like the right place to introduce an Iron Man ripoff.Also, Ross's entire storyline felt weird and unneeded. It's only included to add awkward colonizer jokes and set up future MCU films. If he and Ironheart were removed, there would definitely be enough room to have included more from the aforementioned underutilized characters.By the latter half of this movie, the pacing really starts to drag. I've complained recently about Marvel movies like Multiverse of Madness and Love and Thunder being way too short, but this film had no reason to be 2 hours and 40 minutes and feel like it's over 3 hours. There's so much downtime between the action that when the final battle starts, the movie has already overstayed its welcome.The things I'm disappointed they didn't include or flesh out have no excuse to not be here or be better implemented considering how aggressively long and slow the film is.So this definitely isn't a bad movie per se, but it's not fantastic either. It's very bold but very flawed with iffy decisions on what to prioritize and how to structure this challenging project. I was pretty disappointed when I first saw it, but there's some great stuff sprinkled throughout. The lack of T'Challa, awkward pacing, and wasted opportunities easily made it worse than the first movie to me."
8," A surprisingly good and solid movie
",D4V1D2411,/user/ur106641918/,27 November 2022,"After all what happened before the production of this movie even began, one could assume it would not be very good ar at least just meh or safe. Gladly, it was actually really good. Yes, the sudden death of T'challa feels weird when the movie starts because in the MCU it comes very sudden but considering what happened irl itr understandable. Besides from how sudden that happens the rest of the movie feels more natural. The aftermath is shown in a very interesting and serious way, something I was missing in this 4th phase, the story flows very natural, you can understand why suddenly Namor has appeared and his reasons for trying to stay hidden. Also, the comflict Shuri has is very good in the movie, the way they kinda manage to make her a not very good person at the beginning is great but it also comes out of nowhere considering how lighthearted she was on the first movie; it doesnt affect it to much but it still comes as odd. By far the best part is Namor, he is very threatening whenever he is on screen and Im really looking forward to see whats next for him, despite me personally hating the actor. So basically, the story was very well done despite the difficulties it had and it manages to deliver a good story that goes on for a little bit too long but the time is not that bad. Other 2 things that are really impressive are the acting and cinematography; these 2 things are impressive in the movie and it gives an air of freshness to Marvel for now actually standing out in something.So overall a good, entertaining movie with great written characters that goes for a little bit too long, but that leaves a big impact in you after you watch it."
6," Chadwick Boseman is sorely missed.
",fredschaefer-406-623204,/user/ur34623725/,27 November 2022,"If there is one thing BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER gets right is the reverence and respect it gives to the memory of Chadwick Boseman, taken from us way too soon after making the role of T'Challa, the Black Panther, totally and uniquely his own. From the opening montage, where he is the only Marvel superhero whose visage we see, onward throughout the film, his shadow looms over the characters, story, and action. We feel his missing presence in every scene. It is clear that director Ryan Coogler, the returning members of the cast from the first film, and the producers where dealt a very difficult hand when crafting a sequel and finding a way forward. Perhaps it was an impossible chore, perhaps there was no way they could have succeeded under these conditions, but the resulting film was just a disappointment as far as I'm concerned. In the absence Boseman, WAKANDA FOREVER fills the void by elevating the principle female characters to center stage, and having them face off against a threat from Prince Namor, the leader of an undersea race heretofore unknown to the MCU over the issue of vibranium, an all purpose element found in abundance in Wakanda (and the source of its technological superiority), and now for the first time, discovered outside the African nation on the ocean's floor. Coveted by other nations, this sets off a conflict when Namor demands that Wakanda do his dirty work for him, and eliminate the threat from the surface world. I don't fault the actresses-Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and the indomitable Angela Bassett-who totally give it their all, and clearly bring it. But the script goes heavy on the themes of female empowerment, anti-colonialism, and Afro-futurism that earn praise from mainstream film critics and pop culture commentators at the expense of the tension and conflict, and even humor that made the first film something special. A cameo by Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger in a dream sequence only served as a further reminder of what WAKANDA FOREVER was missing. At a running time of more than two and half hours, WAKANDA FOREVER works way too hard to generate some heat with its thin plot. Namor is played by Tenoch Huerta as another antagonist motivated by past injustice, so he never really feels like a Big Bad. And those wings on his heels look silly. Tweaking Namor's origin to make him and his undersea kingdom have a connection to the ancient Mayans, who escape Spanish oppression by ingesting vibranium, works, but giving all of them but Namor blue skin invokes unflattering comparisons to AVATAR (it didn't help that the trailer for James Cameron's latest epic played in the theater before WAKANDA FOREVER). There are some great action set pieces, something the MCU does well, but the resolution of the final battle between Princess Shuri and Namor is underwhelming. There are a few cameos, and I liked the interplay between Martin Freeman and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss. And was I the only one who thought Richard Schiff was just playing an older version of his character from THE WEST WING when he shows up as the Secretary of State?There is a single mid-credits scene that reveals that the legacy of T'Challa is more than what it first appeared, something I thought the movie was leading toward all along. It opens up a host of possibilities for future BLACK PANTHER films, but I was further disappointed that there is no hint as to where Phase IV of the MCU is heading. That was one of my complaints with THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER and I think the loyal fans are getting restless. Namor is a character with a lot of history with The Fantastic Four, and this would have been an opportunity to give us some idea of how and when they might be introduced into the main MCU. Namor also mentions that he is a mutant, one of the first ones ever in the Marvel universe, raising the possibility of the X-Men showing up-how great would it have been if he'd been approached by Magneto in another after credits scene seeing how their back stories have similarities. Will just have to wait and see what the next Ant-Man movie shows us."
5," Underwhelming
",ben_davis-69127,/user/ur103618749/,27 November 2022,It's a good yarn with a nice tribute to Chadwick.The story was far too weak and a shame because the swamp people had a bad ass leader who deserved a bit more screen time.The Black Panther replacement and the ending was predictable and underwhelming. The new Tony Stark was annoying.Basically the two parties needed to sign a non-aggression and mutual assistance pact and give the uni student a slap on the wrist.The film could then have been wrapped up in the first15 minutes.I'll give this a solid 5 as the battle scenes were pretty good but otherwise I would rush back to the cinema to watch this one.
6," A great tribute to Chadwick.
",kianjames-02823,/user/ur154847332/,27 November 2022,I do like this film. Don't get me wrong the action is great.The first half was a great set up. But it just dragged and became very boring. The final act was so anti-climactic.Mediocre villain.Sub-par acting from Lititia Wright. On the other hand I was very impressed with Angela Bassett as the Queen Mother. I knew from the first trailer her performance was going to be great and she delivered!But other than that this film was a great tribute to Chadwick.They dealt with his death very well. And I loved their additional marvel logo sign in with just him. Perfect. Well done Marvel. Made him proud.6.5/10.
10," Powerful Resistance Story
",justinfitch-39091,/user/ur153114402/,27 November 2022,"I enjoyed this film a lot. The strong, multi-dimensional women leaders offered compelling, affirming portrayals of courage, brains, physical training, and the human struggle. The message on the challenges, but more importantly, the rewards of mutli-racial/ethnic solidarity in the face of Euro/American colonial oppression and thievery is more relevant and important than ever. Plus the music and visuals were phenomenal. Refreshing story and characters for a big Hollywood movie.My two things I wish I had done differently were 1) watch the original again before seeing this new one, and 2) hung around after the credits: O didn't realize there'd be a bonus scene!"
1," Too long, not enough black panther, boring story
",Storms786,/user/ur19859680/,27 November 2022,"Positives:1. Great CGI and action sequences.2. Some stellar performances.3. You might spot The Nigerian Nightmare in it! (Kamaru Usman - MMA fighter)Negatives:1. Way too long at 2h 15 mins running time2. Poor story line3. Where was the superhero?!?4. Too focused on being 'PC' and a slight dig at the French!5. May make more sense to people who saw Black Panther 1If they cut an hour from the running length, I would've given 6 stars. Way too long, tried to cram in too much virtue signalling stuff. You could snooze for 15 minutes in parts and still follow it without missing a beat.The scientist character was strange (who was actually a student), why were they trying to kill her? Didn't make sense to me. She'd already invented the machine that could track them so what would killing her achieve? So, the US government wouldn't use her machine if she was assassinated? Didn't make sense to me. Although I admit to snoozing off for a good 30 minutes and had several toilet breaks!I also haven't seen Black Panther 1, so some things were lost on me. I've just found out that the original Black Panther actor died - which explains some of the virtue signalling in this movie. Partly, it was a memorial to the original Black Panther actor.Not for me, 1 out of 10."
7," Black Panther: Wakanda Forever
",jboothmillard,/user/ur4248714/,27 November 2022,"The death of lead actor Chadwick Boseman from cancer was sad and shocking, and a big blow to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, many questioned if his character would be recast for the sequel, but director Ryan Coogler (Creed, Black Panther) went ahead with a story that incorporates this tragic loss. Basically, Shuri (Letitia Wright) is rushing to save the life of her brother, T'Challa, king of Wakanda, who is dying from an illness. She believes he can be cured by the ""heart-shaped herb"" and uses her technology to synthetically recreate the herb after it was destroyed by their cousin N'Jadaka aka Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). But it is too late, T'Challa dies and all Wakanda come together for the funeral of their king, the Black Panther. One year later, a ship containing amounts of Vibranium are stolen. Wakanda is under pressure from nations of the world to gain access to the precious metal. After returning from a meeting at the United Nations, Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) implores Shuri to continue her research on the heart-shaped herb, hoping to create a new Black Panther that will defend Wakanda. But grief-stricken Shuri refuses due to her belief that the Black Panther is a figure of the past. In the Atlantic Ocean, the CIA, and US Navy SEALs use a machine that can detect Vibranium to locate a potential source underwater. The expedition is attacked and all aboard are killed by a group of blue-skinned, water-breathing superhumans from Talokan, led by Namor (Tenoch Huerta). The CIA believe Wakanda to be responsible. Namor confronts Ramonda and Shuri, easily bypassing Wakanda's advanced security, and blames them for the Vibranium race. He gives them an ultimatum: deliver him the scientist responsible for the Vibranium-detecting machine, or Wakanda will be attacked. Shuri and Okoye (Danai Gurira), general of the Dora Milaje, learn from CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) that the scientist in question is MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) student Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne). Arriving at the university to confront Riri about her invention, the group is pursued by the FBI and then by Namor's warriors. In their battle, Okoye is defeated, and Shuri and Williams are taken underwater to meet Namor. Angered by Okoye's failure to protect Shuri, Ramonda strips her of her title as general and seeks out Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), who has been living in Haiti since the attack on Wakanda by Thanos. Namor shows Shuri the underwater kingdom of Talokan, which is rich with Vibranium, and has protected for centuries from discovery by the world. Namor is bitter at the surface world for enslaving the Maya civilization, he proposes an alliance with Wakanda against the rest of the world, threatening to destroy Wakanda if they refuse. Nakia helps Shuri and Riri escape, and Namor retaliates with an attack against Wakanda, during which Ramonda dies from drowning saving Riri. Namor vows to return with his full army, and the citizens of Wakanda relocate to the Jabari mountains for their safety. Meanwhile, Ross is arrested by his ex-wife, CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), for secretly exchanging classified intelligence with the Wakandans. Following the funeral of Ramonda, Shuri uses a remnant of the herb that gave Namor's people their superhuman abilities to reconstruct the heart-shaped herb. Confirming a high percentage of success, she swallows the synthetic herb containing her brother's DNA, and gains superhuman abilities. She meets N'Jadaka in the Ancestral Plane, who urges her to seek revenge. Shuri dons a new Black Panther suit and is accepted by the other Wakandan tribes as the Black Panther. Despite M'Baku (Winston Duke) urging for peace, Shuri wants vengeance on Namor for her mother's death and orders an immediate counterattack on Talokan. Preparing for battle, with Ayo (Florence Kasumba) assuming the position of general of the Dora Milaje, Shuri bestows the Midnight Angel armour upon Okoye, who in turn recruits Dora Milaje member Aneka (Chewing Gum's Michaela Coel) to join her. Riri joins the fight and aids the Wakandans in an Iron Man inspired high-powered mechanical exoskeleton suit. Namor and his warriors are lured by the Wakandans to the surface onto a seafaring vessel where a battle ensues. Shuri traps Namor in a fighter aircraft, intending to dry him out and weaken him. The pair crash onto a desert beach and fight, with Shuri gaining the upper hand as Namor weakens from drying out. But Shuri realises the similarities between their paths and implores Namor to yield, offering him a peaceful alliance. Namor accepts, and the battle ends. Namor's cousin, Namora (Mabel Cadena), is upset at Namor surrendering, but he assures her that the new alliance will one day allow them to conquer the surface world. Riri returns to MIT, leaving her suit behind, while Okoye rescues Ross from captivity. Shuri plants more heart-shaped herbs to ensure the future of the Black Panther mantle. While Shuri is away, M'Baku steps forward to challenge for the throne. Shuri visits Nakia in Haiti where she burns her funeral ceremonial robe in accordance with Ramonda's wishes, allowing herself to finally grieve T'Challa. In a mid-credits scene, Shuri learns that T'Challa has a son, Toussaint (Divine Love Konadu-Sun); his mother Nakia has been raising him in secret, and his Wakandan name is T'Challa. Also starring Isaach De BankolÃ© as River Tribe Elder, Danny Sapani as Border Tribe Elder, Dorothy Steel as Merchant Tribe Elder, Trevor Noah as Griot, Zola Williams as Zola, Richard Schiff as US Secretary of State, and Anderson Cooper as himself. Wright as the new lead is fantastic as the brainy and brave sister character, Bassett and Gurira are great support as the nation leaders, Thorne is good as the young scientist, Freeman is fine in his little screen time, and Huerta does well as the villain. From the opening Marvel logo to the story itself, this serves as a tribute to Boseman, with a melancholic emotional feeling almost all throughout, but it also works well as a female-driven story, with some marvellous special effects and spectacular fights, it is a terrific superhero fantasy action. Very good!"
6," Good but kinda not good
",whrgjjg,/user/ur159263297/,27 November 2022,"Don't get me wrong I think this movie is ok. I mean it's not terrible but it's not amazing like the first one. And that's where the problem begins....The first one is so good and Chadwick was so legendary as the black Panther that it's very hard to follow that performance up. Also with Chadwick dying and wanting to honour his legacy I felt like this movie is the one movie that HAD TO BE MADE but NO ONE WANTED TO MAKE. I felt like the story could have been better but like their hands were tied with what they could do. For instance, Shuri in no plot could have been their when her brother died because the actual actor is dead. The death couldn't have been done differently even if they had wanted to. Because Chadwick couldn't be their. You see what I mean.They did a great job for what they could do but the things i wish were don differently couldn't have been done differently.Overall it's decent, go see it and form your own opinion. I think I'll give it another go eventually and see if I like it better the second time because the first time I watched it I was expecting like the feeling of the first but obviously comparing a movie with no Chadwick to one with him is unfair. RIP Chadwick. So yeah, in my first impressions, it's good but compared to first is kinda meh."

",nick-blakemore,/user/ur5832546/,27 November 2022,"The first one was ok. Respected it's intent and understood the story and chatacters. The follow up is abject nonsense. There is no logic to anything that happens. Characters appear with no development, do things that are completely unrealistic and then the plot is ever more ridiculous.Eg It's unrealistic that the Princess is the only scientist in this country, and stands moving single molecules about in a DNA double helix.It's nonsensical that the rest of the world are completely oblivious to all this going on.I was bored bored bored by the story, had no sympathy for any character on either side and to be frank was just waiting for it to finish after 30mins. It was interminable!What the heck Martin Freeman was doing with his 5 minutes of screen time was questionable. An entirely irrelevant white character with a sexually dominant and unpleasant ex partner. Bonkers."
8," It's possible to care too much.
",zachsimon,/user/ur156513745/,27 November 2022,"It's possible for a great marvel movie to become a 'good' marvel movie simply by trying to include too many great characters.475 more characters? Who needs more than that from anyone who isn't being paid for it?Who needs the opinion of anyone who doesn't have to register their ticket stub before expecting us to pay for their two cents.Yes, Black Panther is 'political.' The decision to attempt non-political movies is political. Militares are funded by taxes. If your film involves military action your film is political.Both Black Panther films are precisely the kind of 'comic book' movies we need, but barely deserve. Watch them both. Without piracy. Then give us your take. Exercise your empathy for these fantasy world characters ESPECIALLY if you assume real world movies somehow deserve a bigger cut of our disposable income."
6," Black Panther: Wakanda Forever
",pettyperez,/user/ur112449313/,27 November 2022,"Very touching tribute to Chadwick Boseman, but that's it. It's way too long and I felt like Shuri had backwards character development in comparison to the first film. They didn't show her strengths properly that were already established in the first film. I missed her main character moment, she doesn't get to shine. Also I missed more of the ""Black Panther as superhero"" narrative, we only got brief glimpses of that. The Black Panther serves more as a symbol rather than the real deal like it was with T'Challa. Next, the movie is very political. I wish it would've focused even more on family and how you gather strength from your loved ones to inspire good in this world."
8," Need To Green-light A Third Film!
",nelsonar,/user/ur53789262/,26 November 2022,"Angela Bassett is a certified Muscle Mommy. With respect! Every time she was on screen I was distracted by her traps and back. As a 30 year old female, I hope I look that good at 64. She's killed it! And, of course, her acting was incredible. She plays the strong queen well, without it being a one dimensional character.Ryan Coogler directed a beautiful film that does justice to Chadwick Boseman, while playing into the strengths of his female dominated cast. People forget that there is nothing stronger than a mother, especially after she has lost a child. Coogler plays into that so well that it created DIMENSIONAL female characters, something other Hollywood directors could learn from. Each female has their own personality and desires. Loved every minute watching the Wakanda women.Also, can we talk about Namor? Perfectly casted. Rich and soulful acting. He is the only good MCU ""villian"" at this point, with justified motives. A lot of MCU films have a villian, give him one reason to want to destroy the world, and think that's reason enough. It's not. There's no depth to that. I hope we see more of him!My only complaint about the movie is that it was too long, the last several scenes were a lot. It was just scene after scene after scene. I also didn't like the desperate attempt at nostalgia and sympathy the MCU is trying to pull with T'Challa suddenly having a kid? Out of nowhere? Not believable, wasn't set up beforehand and unnecessary. We didn't need that and I truly don't care about some kid not even being raised in Wakanda."

This movie was about the different impact of grief and process of healing. This isn't just another superhero movie. This speaks to what we are dealing with right now. The movie is showing use that everyone has a way of processing grief and that your feelings are valid but don't let it consume you. All though in this movie we were saying farewell to Chadwick, this movie allowed me to be at peace with the love ones I had to say farewell too as well. I lost my Tia to breast cancer and my grandma passed a few years after I graduated college. I understood what Shuri went through feeling helpless that you couldn't save the ones you love and wishing you had more time to spare with them but knowing they are always there with you. This is a movie we needed. Teaching the next generation to allow yourself to process your grief."

It is unusual and well orchestrated.It's one of those films you get immersed in and on top of that you've no idea how it'll end.A great film.Note: for those of us who are Latin American and know our local histories. There is a relationship between the moment in which the conquistadors arrived in Central America and South America and how they treated the indigenous people.Many of our local stories told that the indigenous people escaped in boats through portals in specific lagoons in Latin America.It is a story that is very close to my local indigenous culture and seeing it reflected in the film made me see that the director did his homework to get to know African and Mesoamerican culture in depth."

Tenoch Huerta was astounding as Namor. If you're willing to be patient and understand the film's importance on showing the levels of grief then this is the film for you.The beginning credits were a bit of tear jerker seeing Chadwick up thereI can't wait for the next one and to see what else Marvel has up their sleeve."

So I wanted to watch this film made after passing away of Chadwick Boseman. As I wrote it was a festival but this festival was funeral of Chadwick and T'Challa the king. I couldn't stop crying.I enjoyed MCU with their max power which I hadn't seen since 'Endgame'.I don't think this film was a hero film but it was a war film. There were some scenes that I didn't get; such as the scene of regaining a hostage. It seemed opportunism for me and it often happens in MCU. Also in MCU, one of important themes were forgotten and came to smoke, which I don't like.The battle scenes were nice. I like M'Baku, the backhand punch with slow motion.I understood the last scene Shuri recalling her brother meant she would open her mind to it."
10," Moving and thrilling! A great tribute
",thefourthalien-1,/user/ur18033950/,26 November 2022,"Wakanda Forever is a fitting tribute to Chadwick, and a kick ass film to boot. The times that his image flashed across the screen, there was a vacuum of silence in the theatre. His presence was felt throughout and strengthened the movie.I wasn't sure Letitia was right to carry on the mantle but she steps up and delivers. Big praise to Tenoch as Namor. All his scenes were mesmerising.All the actors gave us their A game - especially Angela Bassett; what a force of nature she is. Music was also stellar, not just the ethereal score but choice of songs. A film to watch over and over. See it in IMAX -- it really is the only way! âœ¨"
4," It wasn't terrible... But definitely way overhyped and not very memorable
",lambo637,/user/ur15360379/,26 November 2022,"I'll be honest, I'm not very big into Marvel stuff at all. I'll go see a Marvel movie if the trailer for that particular movie really catches my attention or if a friend/girlfriend really wants to go see it. In this case it was the latter as I had a couple friends who were excited about it and wanted to see it so we all went.Now this wasn't a terrible movie by any means. In fact is was pretty solid as far as your typical big Hollywood action movies go. It had a solid plot that wasn't too all over the place (even though I felt they were trying to have too many different plots going for one movie, but they all tracked pretty well), the action parts were pretty entertaining and the acting was really very solid.So why only 4 stars? Because even though this wasn't a bad movie, I still walked out of the theater very disappointed. With all the hype around this movie I guess I was just expecting a lot more. It just felt like more of the same old Marvel type movie to me. It had the same old retreaded plot style, the same old style of character arcs, and the same old quips and hero bravado you get with any generic super hero movie. At the end of the day it was just another super hero movie to throw into the pile of all the other super hero movies out there. In fact, on my drive home just 20 minutes after the movie let out, I realized that there were large portions of the movie that I flat out couldn't even remember because they were just so generic or basic ""same old, same old"" type of stuff I've seen in any other Marvel movie. At the end of the day, Wakanda Forever is just another basic Marvel movie that everyone is excited about now, but will be completely forgotten and fade into obscurity 6 months down the road when the next one comes out.It was just not a memorable or outstanding movie."
8," Under Coogler's careful direction, the Marvel Cinematic Universe expands again, bringing Prince Namor and his people to the screen.
",khanbaliq2,/user/ur22131361/,26 November 2022,"I'm not some Marvel fanboy. In fact, I don't like to be a fan of anything. Therefore, I was honest when I reviewed Taika Waititi's sloppy, even disastrous, Thor: Love and Thunder. But Wakanda Forever is another success for Marvel Studios. Seeing this film was the best experience that I had in a theater in a long time. When the film came to an end, I thought that it's now my favorite film from Phase Four of the MCU. But, after thinking some more about this, I decided that Spider-Man: No Way Home and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness are on par with Wakanda Forever. Some people have claimed that Kevin Feige has been giving directors more creative freedom since Phase Four began. If this is indeed the case, I understand why the output of Phase Four was uneven when it comes to quality. Wakanda Forever has director Ryan Coogler's style all over it. First of all, there aren't many action scenes in the film because it seems to me that Coogler prefers to focus on character development. This doesn't become a problem in the film because the performances of the actors (especially of Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Michael B. Jordan, and Tenoch Huerta) are good, the cinematography is good (for a modern film), the direction is good, and the music is good. Therefore, the scenes of people talking aren't a snoozefest here. I cared about Shuri's struggle more than I cared about T'Challa's struggle in Black Panther (2018). It seems that Shuri intentionally puts on a suit that looks similar to N'Jadaka's suit from Black Panther because she wants to get revenge. I do like the first Black Panther film, which contains more action scenes, but I like Wakanda Forever more because it's directed better and because it's more polished. Perhaps the reasons why this is the case are because the film has a bigger budget ($250 million) and because production and filming took longer. Or the reason could have been because Feige was more involved in making Wakanda Forever as good as possible. I think that the filmmakers and the actors wanted to make a fitting tribute to Chadwick Boseman, who died in 2020, but they also didn't want the film to be a waterworks show. The country of Wakanda is a more believable place in Wakanda Forever than in Black Panther. Since Wakanda Forever is a Marvel Studios film, it might gross more than $1 billion by the end of its theatrical run. Its popularity also means that it has already gotten plenty of hate from the haters that hate its ""woke"" content and plenty of praise from the lovers that love the MCU. I'm neither a hater nor a lover of the MCU. I simply like it because it's a good film and because it's another fantastic addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
7," Cinema Omnivore - Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) 7.1/10
",lasttimeisaw,/user/ur3967726/,26 November 2022,"""Wright makes the most of her slender figure to rule the roost, she can carry off a Pyrrhic win but has a lot to learn to be a sage leader figure, Huerta possesses a honest-looking coolness that differs from common villainy, Gurira's General Okoye is the legit action star who is unfairly taken to task, however, it is veteran Bassett who receives the best notice among the cast, and her Queen Ramonda lords over the first half of the picture like nobody's business, an almighty Bassett fires on all cylinders and is imperiously stunning in white locks. It is frustrating that in order to pander to younger generations, older, parental characters are customarily disposed of as an impetus for younger heroes/heroines to bestir themselves or accomplish a rite of passage (by no accident, I vented the same frustration in BLACK PANTHER 4 years ago), what if Ramonda succeeds to be the new panther, can you imagine that? Bassett shows she has enough welly to spare, it is scenarists who are too craven to take a chance.""read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, please google it, thanks."
6," Beautiful, but flawed
",luc1anr0se,/user/ur159224204/,26 November 2022,"Wakanda Forever is a beautiful movie, and does a good job on sending off Chadwick Boseman (R. I. P). The movie is visually stunning and introduces one of the best villains in the MCU, however it just doesn't feel right. The plot wasn't especially interesting and it just didn't have the same feeling and connection as the first movie, maybe that's due to the change in protagonist or due to the events surrounding the movie but the plot didn't feel super engaging and I didn't really feel connected or invested in the storyline's or characters. The focus has shifted from Wakanda and it's rich culture and history which is understandable, however it still was barely included in the movie at all which is something that gave the first movie such a unique feeling. It's fine as a popcorn flick, but it didn't have me engaged enough to be invested in a sequel."
6," Too long, too muddled
",lord_orsum,/user/ur81548122/,26 November 2022,"Let's start with the good points - this film doesn't try to be all comedy and spectacle, like the recent Dr Strange 2 and Thor 4. In fact, there is almost zero comedy at all.It does try to bring some drama, and to make some points about the responsibility of nations to use their wealth, resources and technology for global benefit, rather than national advancement.Namor is different to the comics, but once I got past the initial differences, I think the portrayal was a good one. He isn't a one-dimensional villain, his people are descended from the Mayans, and he has proper motivation.But the film has a lot of problems. Firstly, the pacing is all over the place - it should be at least half an hour shorter. The comic-book science is paper thin (Shuri extracts DNA from plant fibres on a bracelet that has been underwater for 400 years, but cannot do the same from the recently dead plant in her lab). Shuri takes a spear right through her stomach and out of her back, but gets over it after a short breather. The Wakandan ship is breached from undersea, tilts over by 45 degrees and then the next scene it is upright and apparently seaworthy again. The fact that Namor's people take mortal wounds but get up again is never explained.And then there is still my biggest problem with Wakanda. Both Black Panther films promote the idea that Wakanda is a Utopian society, both technology and socially. Yet they still choose their leader by who is best at beating up other challengers.I think there was a missed opportunity here. Namor would be more likely to say ""join us, or if not, don't get in our way"", as he plans to attack the rest of the surface world. This would present Wakanda with a far more interesting moral dilemma - standby by and watch untold millions die, or utilise their resources and technology to aid the nations who have been trying to rob them."
8," Love it!!!!!!
",sunnie-36640,/user/ur147630510/,26 November 2022,"This movie has really great moments!!! I loved the way the memory of Chadwick Boseman was kept alive. There were some beautiful tributes and real heartfelt and emotional moments but it was the perfect combination of action that MCU fans crave and sentiment. And I loved how the Mayan culture was showcased and appreciated and I definitely want to see more. Namor is such a brilliant character and Tenoch Huerta did a great job, I felt the presence that his character had. He definitely deserves an individual movie and I think Ryan Coogler would be perfect to direct it. There was nothing over the top and it didn't feel forced and the actors delivered as always."
4," Disappointing
",divyesh_parikh,/user/ur159214515/,26 November 2022,"I will write my first ever review on IMDB. This is a no spoiler review.Bad Things: The movie is 2 hours 40 minutes long. My expectations from Marvel movie is that they have to be sharp, about 2 hours mark (except for Avengers) and lots of actions. This movie is none of these. The movie is quite long, a lot of talking and is on very less actions. Plot wise few things don't make sense. Clearly missing Chadwick's charm.Good: CGI look slick. There is some humour and little bit of predictable suspense factor. Movie is high on emotions.I am a big fan of superheroes movies but this one along with Thor 4 has been disappointed for me. In fact, I have found Black Adam more entertaining than Black Panther 2.I wish Marvel invests more into action sequences in such a long movie and also shorten the length in general."
1," Sappy SLOW Boring NO Continuity
",ramseytamimi,/user/ur26802651/,26 November 2022,"Worst Recent Marvel Movie! I'm so frustrated I had to sit through that garbage. Why is the villain a mermaid with wings on his ankles?!? How stupid! If you haven't seen it yet, WAIT FOR IT TO BE ON DISNEY+What does this have to do with the multiverse or Kane the Conqueror?This movie starts sad and ends emotional.Looking for action? Wrong movie; don't let the trailer fool you. Want to cry and don't mind slow boring movies? This movie will be right up your ally!Bottom line: I think this is the worst movie Marvel has made; almost as bad as the last Thor movie. Number 1 movie in the world? God help us lol."
7," This movie was good.
",babymanperson,/user/ur115120020/,25 November 2022,"The plot of the movie is basically the black panther from the previous movie t-challa so his mother becomes queen. Other countries are trying to steal Vibrianium from Wakkanda. When the US tries to find Vibrianium in the ocean, they are attaked by blue aquatic people because it belonged to them. They find out an American girl Ruri Williams created a Vibrianium detector. They need her help and then they get chased by the cops. Then Ruri and Suri get kidnapped by the blue fish people. Tachalla's girl friend becomes a spy again and saves Ruri and Shuri. She kills one of the blue people then they go to war. Then the Americans think Wakkanda is responsible for the attack. Then Namor shows up and asked The Queen to help them take over the world and they said no. Later they kidnapped the fight scenes and action was really good. I only have one slight issue with the movie. I wish Shuri cut Namor's head off. He totally had it coming and it was silly. I get it I get it. It's a family movie. Parents might complain if someone's head was cut off."
4," Lost the humbleness of the first one
",sylvainmolinier,/user/ur71181462/,25 November 2022,"I'm a big Marvel and BP fan. But this was such a disappointment. The movie started beautifully with lots of emotions and respect for what Black Panther and Wakanda has represented as powerful yet humble and just. But progressively shifted in this aggressive Wakandan ego trip with the vilainization of a civilization, which, while going through same hurts and issues, is painted as less smart, more wild, and to be tamed population. Along that Shuri is almost becoming dictatorial, way past a vengeance storyline, becoming hard to even like. All making it feel like a very strange and uncomfortable to watch race war between these two nations. And Namor who is a prominent Marvel character becomes this unlikeable, weak-minded, and unsettling one that doesn't fit into the MCU, certainly not as an Avenger or Illuminati... And some characters should have gotten more of a development like MBaku. In short, Marvel Studios lost me on this one, I left feeling very confused as to what I had watched."
5," Very slow and uninteresting
",cigdemdonmez-93956,/user/ur148360439/,25 November 2022,"I'm not a huge marvel fan but enjoy some of their movies like the first Black Panther. However, this movie was so slow to develop, lacked in protagonist and in character development.It was always going to be difficult to introduce a new leading actor but if the story made more sense, we would have more engaged with that. I didn't get who was the lead of the movie. I love the AI voice .I feel this movie targeted a specific demographic of viewers and it's only fair given that 90 % of all entertainment is based on Caucasian representation. However, the first movie was so great that I'm very disappointed with this one."
8," Grievance, politics and tactical blunders: Black Revengers - Mini Blunder Game
",DM_2,/user/ur23383299/,25 November 2022,"10/10 for effort, 8/10 for execution
It's a new popular trend of 2022 that all superhero movies must be disappointing. Thus, Wakanda Forever is quite a refreshingly good experience albeit not perfect. First of all, let's address an elephant in a room - Massive Opportunity! In the world of grievance and discontent to have a strong emotional story about loss and healing is an instant money cow.Many already know the story of making this movie. First Black Panther movie was a major success, script was already done for the second one when Chad died and then Covid happened. What an opportunity! Since this movie already had dozens of millions of people emotionally connected why on earth one would add to already packed story additional story of search for cure, death, grievance, loss, and a need for a new hero without extending it to two movies?At the end - it is a good, emotional movie with a good message. A bit too packed, a bit too little time to develop and tell the story of all the different characters... But it is what it is... Afterall everyone involved in this project quite literally had to deal with as much drama as there in the actual movie.Even from financial perspective it would have been much better idea to shoot 2 movies back-to-back consuming only 15-20% more budget, and doubling the revenue! In hindsight - most MCU movies faced delays or had to be pushed due to Covid. If important character arcs had extra 5 mins to develop the story better, the first half of the story would have been an easy box office success in 2021. And the second event more in 2022. It quite literally had Avengers Infinity War & Endgame potential. Good movie, but a bit of a wasted opportunity."
10," A big challenge that Ryan Coogler overcame!
",lugoshendra,/user/ur159194323/,25 November 2022,"A big challenge that Ryan Coogler overcame!I want to start by saying I haven't been the biggest fan of this Phase 4 by Marvel that started with Black Widow in 2020, it's been hit & miss for me so I was nervous for the sequel to Black Panther. I'm happy to report that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a success. I think Ryan Coogler and his team hit a home run with Wakanda Forever by paying tribute to Chadwick Boseman and moving the story forward respectfully.I won't go into spoilers, but the movie starts with an emotional bang. Wakanda Forever builds on the great fondation that was established in the first Black Panther, a visual feast with breathtaking production design, fantastic costumes and impressive action sequences. The music from Ludwig Goransson is once again phenomenal, he creates a signature to this film that gives us the iconic sound of Wakanda while incorporing new themes for this sequel.Similar to the first film with Wakanda, there's a lot of world-building with the newly introduced Namor and the underwater world. This allows director Ryan Coogler to let his vision shine on the screen, it's spectacular to look at and the way they filmed the underwater sequences was truly astonishing. Ironically, most of superhero movies depend on their villains in order to succeed, they nailed it with Killmonger and what they did here is just as good, if not better.I don't think it's a perfect film, with a hefty runtime of 161 minutes, there are some moments that were dragging in the middle for me, but I think it was necessary for this film to be a bit longer than usual. Every character has their shining moments, Shuri is at the heart of this movie but Nakia, Okoye, M'Baku and Queen Ramonda all get their shining moments and a solid story arc that is rewarding by the end, so I don't really have an issue with the movie being this long.I have some other nitpicks that are spoiler-y, so I cannot really discuss them at the time. Everyone's motivation is clear and the main story is so engaging that I didn't really care for Marvel doing their usual ""laying the ground for the future"" stuff with certain characters (without getting into details). However, I can say that Namor was a terrific character, I absolutely love what they did with him storywise and visually. He absolutely slays during the action sequences, Tenoch Huerta is a great actor that fits the role perfectly, no surprise with the spot-on Marvel casting there.This is a movie to see on the big screen, without a doubt this is the best film the MCU has delivered in the Phase 4. The scale is epic but the film feels very intimate and personal because of what happened with Chadwick. The fact that they incorporated his passing into the story beautifully was so important & crucial. Ryan Coogler is probably the best director working for Marvel right now and I'm very excited to see what he does next after this big win."
6," Who writes these?
",perinteinen,/user/ur82182020/,25 November 2022,"It was pretty ok, but couldn't watch without mumbling and rumbling to myself stupidity of some scenes and conversations + plot going on.Who writes these may should be asked!!

Dont they think at all?As this movie shows, man are stronger than woman. Why isn't wakanda full woman ""country""?Wakanda has technology to heal people who had amazing damaga, but can't help drowned his hearth stopped minutes? I don't buy this.

9," Black panther is currently the most popular ""Marvel movie"". Every event in the movie represents revenge.
",kamolovravshan,/user/ur159188878/,25 November 2022,"More effective however is Shuri, who begins as an arrogant, argumentative and angry young woman struggling to process grief through to a much more level-headed and well-rounded person by the final credits. However, she's nowhere near commanding enough to amplify her position of power. Late on, she completely over-acts her line to Namor, booming ""I am the Black Panther, and I am here for retribution!"" In a way that feels like it was taken right from the cringiest parts of drama school.The fact is, Angela Bassett is the best character in this by far, absolutely commanding the screen in almost every scene she features in. In fact, it almost makes one feel she should have been the next Black Panther instead!Wakanda Forever attempts to do many things but at no point does it actually get its pacing right. The middle of this film is absolutely bogged down in a constant charade of snoozy monologues and long-winded scenes that could easily have been removed from this completely. Ironically, the more grandiose and expansive this film becomes, the less impact it has.It's incredibly frustrating because there is a good movie in here somewhere. If the film had centered on Shuri grappling with grief, and finding herself riffing with Bucky (who's still a prisoner of Wakanda by the way but only referenced as ""that white man"" once), the film could have allowed the theme of grief to be properly explored in a format that doesn't require undermining slapstick comedy or a big bombastic action piece at the end.Aesthetically, Wakanda Forever does look pretty good, with Namor's homeworld beautifully realized and parts of Wakanda and its traditional funeral rites absolutely stunning to behold. It's a pity then that simple things like CGI beats (including Ironheart's abysmal suit at the end) undermine this beauty. Not only that but the choreography is a mixed bag at best. A fight on a bridge during the middle of this movie is disastrously done, with the camera zooming in on a spear just missing a Talokan warrior... and then in the next frame showing that same spear on the opposite side sticking into the warrior's stomach. I suggest all of you watch this movie."
8," Loved it
",linzisymons,/user/ur18284091/,25 November 2022,"A beautiful tribute to Chadwick, the end pre credit scene was a tear jerker and Rihanna's new track sounded so great with the context of the scene.The female cast were outstanding. Brilliant performances from Letitia Wright, Lupita N'Yong'o and Angela Bassett - stand out performance from Danai Gurira and Michaela Coel was an amazing addition.The Micheal B Jordan cameo was a brilliant surprise and the character of Namor was brilliantly played - the only thing I would've liked more of is his backstory, it felt a tiny bit rushed.Loved the whole narrative, really funny in places too. My favourite Marvel film of the year."
6," I really wish I could see what this movie could have been without being constrained to the MCU.
",Dominic_25_,/user/ur152062879/,25 November 2022,"I am not sure how I feel about this phase of Disney MCU. Ryan Coogler really can make good movies and I'd love to see him with more creative freedom.It is impossible to make this movie without addressing the real life tragic death of Chadwick Boseman. This film honors him both literally and narratively. It is a film about loss and mourning.Yet it is also a Marvel movie and the show must go on for the sake of the mighty dollar.This very powerful nation lost their king, just as they had in 2018's Black Panther. So I guess Marvel just decided to re-use the villain story. This time we get an indigenous superhero, Namor, who is already the leader of a massive underwater empire. They were displaced by the colonization of Europeans, similar to the colonization of Africa by Europeans. And so Namor is compelled by this to literally fight a war against the world created by that history. Just as it is in the first film, this is a righteous cause. And it is again presented as a horrible idea because anything that upsets the global capitalist system is inherently bad. The first film never reconciled the injustice of the past with the injustice of that system and so when it tries to build on that faulty premise it is still on shaky ground. But this time, not sure if it is because it has been a long time since I've seen the first film or not, it doesn't feel as cartoonishly depicted and easily discarded of a sentiment.Unlike in the original Shuri actually gives a reason for not going down a path of vengeance, which itself is very confusing. In their attempts to rectify the ideological contrast in the first one they sacrifice Shuri's character development in this one (and I couldn't get past an anti-vaxxer playing a character trying to cure diseases and trust so much in technology).I'm not saying they did a terrible job with her, just that they could have done more. She is struggling with the loss of her brother throughout the entire film and then she loses her mother. This tragedy makes her agree with Warmonger from the first movie, so we have the same ideology from the villain in the first film present in our protagonist and antagonist in this one. Which is all very cool. But with that we get just a sudden realization in the middle of the big fight from Shuri that she is bad. It is a very drastic change in her and it mirrors her bloodlust after trying to work toward a diplomatic solution with Namor for like 30 minutes, which was only ruined by her mom starting a war.Really this film shows how volatile war can be and the negative consequences of the impulses of monarchs. It is a very good condemnation of autocratic regimes, but it does so accidentally. Just as it leaves sideplots unresolved, partly seeming to rely on future installments but partly almost from negligence. It is amazing that after all these years Marvel still feels the need to have big epic battles where unnamed characters are treated like chess pawns, freely killed off like they do not matter. There was honestly no reason for the leaders to not work on a diplomatic solution, especially given that they literally were before the breakdown in communication from Shuri and her mother.This film a tragedy of war and the superhero industrial complex. I think Ryan Coogler could have helmed a great film about the loss of T'Challa. Unfortunately we live in a universe where that film has to include pow pow bang bang destruction and violence. It's the instinct to turn good stories into superhero flicks that bothers me the most."
1," Boring
",sharaths-66751,/user/ur81478433/,25 November 2022,"I was looking forward to the movie, but it fell seriously short of expectations. Ironheart was a decent addition. I fell asleep half way through the movie. I wish it was a better tribute to Chadwick Boseman as he deserved better.Weak storyline. Namor had no depth and there was no chemistry between the characters. T'Challa and Chadwick were sorely missed. The cameos did nothing to increase the entertainment value. It could've been the result of bad editing but I am not sure how much could've been done with this storyline. The was as if Marvel rushed to make a sequel and did justice to no one.This is a movie that should not have been made."
9," RIP Chadwick
",ericstevenson,/user/ur66601046/,25 November 2022,"So, this movie was very anticipated, as people were wondering what they would do with the Black Panther character, T'Challa as his actor died. They simply say his character died of an illness off screen. I guess it would be in poor taste to say he died of cancer. The plot is great, with the government looking for vibranium and finding some belonging to Namor and his people who live underwater. Namor offers to ally with Wakanda and they'll destroy the rest of the surface world because his people belonged to a tribe of Native Americans killed by colonists. Everything is so beautiful here.The details of the underwater City (Talokan) are especially wonderful. I think the reason this works so well like the first one is because it was a more serious film than the average MCU film. Of course, it has wild epic battles, but does take on more important topics like nationalism and isolationism. As T'Challa became the Black Panther in the first one, I knew we'd see a new one here. We even get a great surprise appearance by Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) although I don't really know how. This has been my favorite Marvel movie of the year. ***1/2."
4," Soooo boring
",PigNemesis23,/user/ur41945908/,24 November 2022,"I really wanted to like this, I really did, but it bored me to sleep. It sucks it happened, and I hate missing anything even if it's boring.The action sequences are really great and the cinematography is beautiful, along with the underwater CGI. The problem is, the scenes where they're relying on story to keep your attention are severely underwhelming and just failed to keep my attention. It's a lot of talk, talk, talk, and just feel really flat for me.In addition, there are some really goofy suit designs that show up and just look plain silly, not to mention a little cartoonish for a movie of the caliber that this was supposed to be."
8," A better phase 4 film with tons of plot holes
",tripledoubleboss,/user/ur115624569/,24 November 2022,"Positives:1. The tone and seriousness is what carries the movie for me. And is something I enjoy alot more than alot of the rest of the mcu.2. With the tone Coogler handles the emotional scenes in this film extremely well and does the best possible job with the hand he was delt with.3. This is by far one of the best acted movies in the mcu and has oscar worthy performances4. Mbaku once again is a star in this role and is so perfect for this movie5. The comedy is also extremely funny in this movie and does not feel forced but flows in great6. The very end and post credits is so fantastic and such a perfect trubute to chadwick boseman7. Namor is also an absolute star in this film and one of the best parts8. The action in the early parts of the movie is well cheographed and editedNegative:1. The music definitely does not live up to the first one and is def no where near a positive.2. The movie for the whole time felt like it was missing bossman and even though theres wasn't much they could've done the gap i still feel.3. The death of tchalla to me also feels like we should just accept it and yes he did die in real life which is extremely sad this is still a movie and as an audience a better explanation is deserved and also would've had a better effect on me emotionally if we got to see a little more4. The mcu is starting to become so oversaturated that plot lines feel like so repetitive for example Namor feels so much like Killmonger its all i could think of and Shuris mom dying and then Shuri being the good guy letting Namor live was exactly like in No way home peters mom dies he wants vengeance on goblin but makes the good guy decision to let him live.5. Ri ri not bring taken in by the government after literally creating a vibtianium detector makes no sense and much like anything with the government it feels like every decision they make is stupid with so many plot wholes.6. Martin freemans wife character also just needs to stay out of this movie whenever she is jn it i feel like it ruins the tone of the film.7. I enjoyed some of action although the end battle was a smaller scale than hyped up to be and the battle between namor and shuri had many many plot holesOverall:The film was delt a terrible hand although they do the best job possible. Coogler sets the tone of the film perfectly and creates high emotions out of the audience. I think the script is lacking with many many plot holes and the music isnt as good and can be slow at time.

8," Amazing, Emotional Film!
",jimmycondon,/user/ur158882112/,24 November 2022,"This movie was just absolutely amazing. I mean you have Chadwick Boseman passing away to production issues to your new black Panther being anti vaccination. This movie went through so much drama especially for Ryan Coogler and he still delivered an amazing film. He should get a nominee for best director at the Oscars. They balanced the comedy and the seriousness in the movie beautifully. I also loved a lot of the characters like M'Baku, Ironheart and Namor was a great villain. One thing though at least for me is that some of the major events in the film were kinda of predictable. Like Queen Ramonda's death was kinda of obvious because if she was queen but yet there was no Black Panther than obviously her death would make Shuri become the next Black Panther. Although it looked like Shuri was about to straight up kill Namor, you knew he would turn at the end. There were a few surprises though like Killmonger showing up or T'challa's son. Overall though I loved this movie."
9," A touching, somber, more mature storyline
",nlgthunder,/user/ur126457071/,24 November 2022,"I must start with the fact that the tributes to Chadwick woven throughout this story we're beautiful and so gut wrenching. They did a very nice job of writing in a way that incorporates and honors his legacy. And the opening Marvel sequence was in very good taste.I was hopeful that this movie could keep the magic of Wakanda and the other characters alive. For me, it did that. While it would be so much better, a thousand times over, to have Chadwick in this film, the fact simply is that he couldn't be. And out of that was borne deeper dimensions to his family and chaisms and conflicts that pulled me in and kept my attention.I enjoyed the other elements of this film as well. I found the character of Namor to be well acted, written, and executed. I also enjoyed the complicated history behind him and his people, as well as how it overlapped with Wakanda. I felt invested in the outcomes of the conflicts.There are definitely things that could've been better. This wasn't a perfect film. But it's certainly better than any other recent installations in the MCU in 2022. It doesn't rely on so many gimmicks and overdone, unwelcome juvenile humor that Marvel/Disney seem dead set in making the cornerstone of a once story-rich franchise. ""Wakanda Forever"" is poised, pleasing, and emotional. Nice job to Ryan Coogler, crew, and cast!"

",juliavu-57190,/user/ur135656071/,24 November 2022,"That's what I think. However the movie to me is slow, it's necessary to show the emotions of the protagonist in order for the story to develop.However, it's just not the Marvel I know.After Iron Man died, all the new movies doesn't seem to feel the same anymore.Not enough actions, and even when there's action, there's no thriller like anyone is dying. There's not enough people dying to make the story worthwhile. So in the end, I'm like, is it really worth my time?The acting is spectacular from the cast, I can see the emotions and feel what they feel. Besides the acting, the story doesn't have much meaning & the action wasn't intense.On the cinema screen, it seems the background is always blurry. Not sure if that's my eye problem or the direction the director is taking.It was a good movie, just not the best.Will I watch it again? No, will I recommend to watch it? Yes."

",zeanpaliaky,/user/ur154730341/,24 November 2022,"The fact that the trailer itself got me so hyped, and when it came out. I have to say... It's just not what I expected to see. There's a lot wrong w this movie.First, there's only one solid acting in this movie, and it's the queen Ramonda, the other character is just MEHHH... Even Okoye.And then there's the pacing. Cant believe how fast this movie jumps from point A to point B, wayyyyy to fast. Like my God, the movie is almost three hours, at least slow it down a little bit. And what is the point of Shuri in meeting Killmonger, she's supposed to kill Namor right? I just dont know what is going on in this movie.Its a one shot movie, you watch it, and then thats it."
10," The Legend of T'Challa awaits...
",higherall7,/user/ur25225705/,24 November 2022,"Well! No matter what anyone tells you, I suggest you see this film first and make up your own mind about it. As for myself, I will start out by saying this movie is a long way from Sun Ra's SPACE IS THE PLACE (1974), as well as THE BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET (1984), or even THE ADVENTURES OF PLUTO NASH (2002), when you get right down to it. One thing is for sure, Afro-futurism or African-futurism, if you will, is alive and well. Be that as it may, there's still a whole lot of World-Shaking going on in this tale. There is a look and a feel and a glide and a slide that is infectious and compelling. I cannot say all of it will go down easy, as it promotes and displays the scorched Earth pyrotechnics of the Hollywood Western mindset, but director Ryan Coogler has crafted a product of both rich passion and masterly restraint.Naturally, it was a tremendously difficult challenge to confront the passing of Chadwick Boseman in a sensitive and tasteful way, but it is here that Coogler succeeds with flying colors. The mysterious death of T'Challa is used as the beginning major pivot of the plot for this story, but with everyone among the cast and crew reeling and mourning the loss of a great human being and actor, not to mention a wonderfully creative personality, it is still too painful a moment and occasion to even begin considering a replacement in the minds of many. This is a perfectly understandable and respectable sentiment. Unfortunately, looking at the situation from a more dispassionate point of view, the search for a suitable successor to the fallen King among the ranks of the family and the citizens of Wakanda would have made for an absorbing drama all its own.But this sudden tragedy, almost feeling and carrying the faint scent of high-tech buck breaking on a cosmic scale, may indeed be too fresh a wound to respond to with logical equipoise. Suffice to say that director Coogler touches all the bases of this presentation with an informed and adroit sensitivity that distinguishes him uniquely among his peers. Now that Boseman has joined the ranks of those fallen heroes and greats such as Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King, striving for a community catharsis within the soul of propriety must have been uppermost in the filmmaker's mind. That this film does not reference the martyrs of the past amongst leaders and kings may in hindsight be seen as a missed opportunity, but then again, such measures may be beyond the scope of The Marvel Universe. As it is, this present entertainment is yet another quantum leap in Afro-futurism.Angela Bassett as Queen Ramonda and Leitia Wright as Shuri/Black Panther give Oscar winning performances. Tenech Huerta Mejia as Namor brings a Mayan Meso-American sensibility to the subplot of this adventure. It is his presence and back story that supplies events with a special cross-cultural gravity. Where this sequel succeeds brilliantly is in exploring the interface between highly spiritual and highly technical imperatives of cultures; how they clash and explode and in the most startling ways harmonize in the quest for enlarged understandings. In the beginning and throughout, it appears that Death drives the narrative, so it comes as a welcome surprise to see that Life resolves it in the end.The women in the cast portray figures of strength, their feistiness a testament to their status in society. Winston Duke playing M'Baka, leader of the Jabari mountain tribe demonstrates along with his men that he has their back. Martin Freeman and Julia Louis-Dreyfus add intriguing spice as CIA operatives attempting to sort out what's going on in Wakanda. But Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia, an undercover spy for Wakanda and Dana Gurira as Okoye, general of the Dora Milaje, Wakanda's special forces, have surprising character arcs. Autumn Durald Arkapaw's cinematography rivals anything Jack Kirby could have drafted, while the music of Ludwig Goransson keeps a stirring eclectic pace with the action of the various scenes and proceedings.While the story explodes in all directions only to arrive back at that place where it is attempting to fill the void left by T'Challa joining the ancestors, the spirit of Boseman seems to tie everything up into a harmonious whole of angst, rivalry, revenge and redemption. There appears to be more ranging in space in this sequel, and while there might be those who would quibble that not all the themes in this saga are given their due emphasis, the upshot feels like Coogler is giving Boseman not so much the send-off he wanted, but indeed the send-off he deserved. While the kingly shoes of T'Challa may prove hard to fill, it may also be revealed that he has more than family and friends to stand up for him in the Marvel universe. We also suspect he has an honored seat awaiting him amongst the gods of African-futurism..."
6," The emotional tribute to the late Chadwick Bozeman is about all this movie has to offer.
",jadensteuerwald,/user/ur151549094/,24 November 2022,"The respectable tribute and emotional sendoff to the late Chadwick Boseman and his MCU counterpart King Tchalla is about all this movie has to offer, living up to marvels current reputation of underwhelming content. Now don't get me wrong, the movie wasn't 'bad', there was nothing wrong with it per say, but there was also nothing special about it apart from the emotional sendoff to Tchalla which really was only the very last scene of the movie. I felt that the death of Tchalla should have been the main focus of the film and had a huge role in the storyline. Instead he was written off in the beginning of the film, tributes at the end, and mentioned a few times in between, only to be overlooked by the death of the queen. The film didn't do enough to keep me fully interested and entertained nor did it do anything to bore me or make me uninterested. It was just sort of bland, and lives up to phase 4s reputation of mediocrity."
9," A Masterpiece
",andrewfeil,/user/ur87840563/,24 November 2022,"This movie was such a beautiful sendoff to Chadwick Boseman that captured much emotion. I felt the emotions throughout the film as it was portrayed in an eloquent way. I think not only did they do Chadwick's sendoff very well, but set up the future of the franchise greatly. I love the designs and creativity that was shown. The great soundtrack that leveled almost all scenes, a brilliant and complex plot; this instantly became a favorite of mine and I believe is comparable to the first Black Panther. I give this movie a 9.2 out of 10 and I would very much recommend to anyone who is remotely interested."
6," Very slow, MCU continuing to decline
",hoke-12603,/user/ur159156051/,24 November 2022,"My son and I were very much looking forward to this movie but it disappointed. The story progressed very slowly and seemed to continue the downturn the MCU has started heading in. Actors/Actresses did a good job so no issues there. The problem is with the writing. They seem to rely too much on special effects and not enough on story telling. Then of course is the teenage genius who now also becomes an elite fighter with a knock-off Iron-Man suit made on the spot. The ending got unbelievably predictable and cheesy, even for comic book standards. Between this movie and Thor: Love and Thunder, we may just start waiting to see these movies when they are free on TV. Too much hype and not enough delivery."
9," Don't trust all the reviews
",bdpbwaj,/user/ur123985183/,24 November 2022,"Giving any film a 10 is extremely hard, which is why I chose a 9. The story, the imagery, music and cultural aspects make this story breathtakingly beautiful. The dedication to Chadwick was needed and long over due. Many may feel it was ""too"" much. I think it was well managed and shows the growth of his sister stepping up through the mourning process. This movie will be a final stamp on his legacy and I wouldn't have expected less. Many new aspects were brought in, as well as new characters. The timing on this movie is expected with such a large storyline. The main plot never lost its fire, while still playing into Easter eggs of the future Marvel films and shows to come. This was a huge task for Marvel and I think they did a fantastic job with all aspects. It was a beautiful story about family, tradition and legacy. I loved every minute."
10," Family of Four
",phneely-11370,/user/ur64132074/,24 November 2022,"My spouse, daughter and myself rated this movie between 8.5 and 10, however my son rated the movie a 5. My son (17) didn't like the storyline with the young scientist. He felt as if her acting was forced and he didn't like how the storyline regarding the Namar was introduced. I understand my son's Point of View, but Considering everything surrounding this movie, the death of Bosman and the rewrite of the script and this is for entertainment, I give it a 10. I was truly entertained and emotionally moved by this movie. I loved how the movie ended with an offspring of the Black Panther (T'Challa). Can't wait for the next movie."
9," Surprisingly heartfelt
",amwilburn-60131,/user/ur110142253/,24 November 2022,"When they said they were making a sequel without T'Challa, I had my doubts. Yet somehow Coogler has delivered the most satisfying project of Phase 4.Like its matching Phase 4 bookend, Wandavision, this is a nuanced study of grief. It's an MCU film, so of course it's also filled with humour and action. This could easily have veered into cheesy territory, but they managed to avoid that and deliver a great film. I actually enjoyed this more than the first one; the 2 hrs 41 min runtime just flew by.I do have a minor complaint about the 3D: whereas it was used to great effect in Avatar, Star Wars Ep7, and most recently Shang Chi (all were 10/10 3D), 3D doesn't work well at all in the dark, and even the well lit scenes were a random grab bag of ineffectual and just ok. Scenes where the 3d worked were generally trivial as well. Overall theatrical 3D for this film is sadly 3.0/10. For once I'm advocating watching in 2D.But the film itself is
9.5/10, A almost A+This actually makes the juvenile humour of Love & Thunder make sense: Marvel wouldn't want 2 emotionally charged films back to back, BPWF would've lost its impact. As JJ Abrams once said: sometimes you have to swing the pendulum one way in order to swing back hard the other way."
1," Ok
",gyskqp,/user/ur158657999/,24 November 2022,"I found it pretty underwhelming. It's a better put together movie than both Thor: Love & Thunder and Doctor Strange & The Multiverse of Madness, and there is no sense it was butchered in the editing room, like both of those movies. That said I probably had more fun with those two.The Chadwick Bosman stuff was touching, but I expected more. Disappointed not to see at least, Bucky there. When I heard there was a cameo, I expected it to be someone at the funeral. I DID NOT see that cameo coming. I thought the Marvel logo was a nice touch.Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett are both good, but I'm not sure where this Oscar nomination talk is coming from. Then again, I didn't think Black Panther should have got a nomination for Best Picture, so she could get one. Winston Duke was a bit wasted as Umkaku, disappointed by what he did at the endThere is no reason for it to be as long as it is. I was bored a few times. I was especially bored during the story between Martin Freeman and Julia Drefuss, it was really weak and unnecessary. Was it just there to put some white people in it? I didn't like the scientist girl, she irritated me and had awful dialogue. Some of the CGI/Green screen work was not the best, too.I can safely say, with the exception of Spider-Man: No Way Home, nothing from Phase 4 will be rewatched, never mind find its way into my collection.Overall I found it OK."
6," Barely Saves Face for an Unsavory Phase 4.
",FallenEye,/user/ur63040106/,23 November 2022,"Perhaps the most disappointing thing about Wakanda Forever is that, the trailers succeeded in evoking emotion far more effectively than the film itself, as I found all the expressive beats of the movie, whether in tribute to Chadwick Boseman or otherwise, lacking the power to captivate for the most part, making the beats feel more like taps, or a snare.On that train of thought, the score however, played a large role in amplifying the movie's deeper elements, and so assisted greatly towards the capturing of audiences' emotion, though sadly, unlike capturing lightening in a bottle, the score still couldn't assist in fully capturing some of the electrifying and shock factors Wakanda Forever attempted to deliver; factors which essentially felt unearned, and premature.Apart from the score, one other element that really helped this movie, was Angela Bassett's performance, which I felt was really good, though not necessarily amazing, as it was essentially one scene that she really dialled her ability up to 10 within all the rest of her scenes where she was simply just good (which is good enough), and demonstrated her expertise with much appreciated excellent execution. Winston Duke also successfully delivered a few moments here and there.Riri Williams, who was also badly cast to boot, on the other hand, and her suit that felt like it just walked out of the Spy Kids franchise, did more harm than good to the movie, while Namor was an uncompelling portrayal of the anti-villain, the new Black Panther is an unconvincing one, the finale sequence was reminiscent of Iron Man the movie and character in several ways, but not nearly as good or exciting, the story and action were unsatisfying, and, the twist was good, but at a practical level, rather than an impactful one.Understandably, yes, the movie was presented with an uphill battle after the tragedy of Chad, but, with what Phase 4 has been, it is difficult to tell if this movie ended up being this that it was, due to circumstances, or Marvel Studios' new self-sabotage approach. Either way, Wakanda Forever didn't quite manage to achieve saving this phase, but it did help it perhaps, to save face, though barely, as the damage has already been done.6.5/10."
6," You've see it all before
",keenerlinder,/user/ur139851200/,23 November 2022,Black Panther was a cultural phenomenon back in 2018 and I was intrigued with how they would handle the loss of the lead star Chadwick Boseman who died in 2020. After seeing this movie I can say they handled his death very well but they didn't handle much else well.The biggest issue with this movie is its length. At over two and a half hours this movie feels far too long. It's very slow and only has a few short action scenes to break up the monotony(Albeit well done action scenes). So much could've been cut. Martin Freeman's character does absolutely nothing in this movie and every scene with him and his annoying boss is grating.I wouldn't mind the length as much if this movie was interesting but the plot is very cookie cutter and doesn't have much else new to offer that other better marvel movies already have.The villains intentions don't make much sense and I didn't find him to be to interesting. The new character Riri has a good introduction and is a likable character but the plot just kind of forgets about her an hour and half in which was a disappointment.One big highlight was Latitia Wrights performance as Shuri was great and her character was written much better than in the first film and her scene with Killmonger was definitely the best scene in the movie.Overall it's a fun movie to watch but doesn't hold up to some of the mcu greats.6/10.
3," Teenflick
",alexanderbolluijt,/user/ur68172481/,23 November 2022,"The first Black Panther was a decent movie. Chad Boswick was great as Black Panther. The story however was lacking a bit, and so was the often cringy humor. The aesthetics made it watchable nonetheless.Wakanda Forever is an entirely different movie. I was hardly able to watch it. Why?1) The writing
The movie is flat out cheesy and full of platitudes. The weight of the story is very thin and doesn't fit a superhero movie. The forced humor doesn't do any character good and is even worse then the first BP movie.2) Acting
The acting overall is tiresome. Angela Basset does a great job, of course. Shuri on the other hand is still infantile and unwatchable. She's just not able to carry the movie.3) Music
The worst part about the movie. Get ready for some very cringy R&B. It's like watching a teen flick, with all the unnecessary melodramatic tones.If you're going to watch this movie with your 13 year old daughter, she'll probably have a decent time. Are you planning to watch this movie, because you want to stay connected to phase 4? Then skip it entirely. Most of the phase 4 movies haven't been very good. They did however somewhat of a story that fit the MCU. This movie, unfortunately does not."
9," Excellent from start to Finish
",cubahamian09,/user/ur50044702/,23 November 2022,"I had to pee during the film, but held it for nearly the entirety of the movie just so I didn't miss anything. The cast obviously cared about the final product. Their delivery of the material was heartfelt, especially the Princess's. The special effects were on point which you expect with the Marvel cinematic universe and I loved the new characters. I'm not too thrilled about the prison break being a patriot myself...but it's just a movie lol The only reason I gave it a 9/10 is bc I think the Shuri/Namor ""will they, won't they"" crap was slow and drawn out. The movie was definitely pretty distant than the actual comic covering this part of their storyline, but it was definitely still enjoyable."

Especially Lupita Nyong'o is the shining Light and Angela Bassett ist still one of the best Actresses in Hollywood. But the Story ist boring, there are no Dramatic Highlights, too much Dialoges which guide to nowhere. The CGI is ridicules, the Editing is in a bad way edgy, the ""Action"" is not Happening.Boseman ist missing in every Frame of the Movie. It hurts what they mixed up here , to earn money, coz i Like/Love Black Panther very much, i own most of the Comics and he is an Icon like Blade. For me as a Fan of this Charakter and Chadwick Boseman, it is not a good FAREWELL TO THE KING. But maybe Tchalla Jr. Will bring the King Back!"

Queen Ramonda, Shuri, M'Baku, Okoye and the Dora Milaje fight to protect their nation from intervening world powers in the wake of King T'Challa's death. As the Wakandans strive to embrace their next chapter, the heroes must band together with Nakia and Everett Ross to forge a new path for their beloved kingdom.Black Panther:Wakanda Forever is one of the best movies Marvel have produced since Endgame. The action sequences are so good and super fun, the comedy is amazing, and the acting is phenomenal (Especially Angela Bassett). Also, the music score was so good that I believe it deserves the academy award for best original score.The film was so emotional from beginning to end as it really honors Chadwick Boseman's legacy. Additionally, the post is credit scene pretty emotional and fulfilling. However, the movie is quite long. With a 2 hours and 4 minutes run time, the movie gets a bit boring sometimes as some scenes are very prolonged and others are even unnecessary.To conclude, the sequel to the Black Panther movie, unlike most of the phase 4 movies, a very good film.

6," Black Panther > Wakanda Forever
",ACollegeStudent,/user/ur118665987/,23 November 2022,"Rating: 6.9Not horrible but not better than the first one. Nonsensical plot points, contradictory character motivations, and a diluted angsty Tchalla as the new black panther hold this movie back. Namor's motivations and actions were completely idiotic: hey Shuri have Wakanda join us against the outside world... or die. It's not like we could just defend the undersea Vibranium ourselves since we have as many soldiers as ""blades of grass"", we'll take casualties waging war on Wakanda, then somehow wage war on the entire world afterward! Also why would Namor think killing ironheart would stop the production of Vibranium detectors, that machine would have already been documented by the US government so killing the maker isn't going to stop these machines from being mass produced. The more you think about this the more issues you'll find like: nobody guarding the queen during the invasion, Wakanda reneging on trade agreements that were the primary theme of the first movie, Nakia instantly figuring out where Shuri was captured because of a hunch, Shuri getting mad at the outside world because tchalla died like they had anything to do with tchalla's death (they were trying to take vibranium by force though), Okoye swatting literal bullets with a spear, etc.. The tribute to Boseman was great, but without Boseman, the movie is lacking potent characters (except Namor but his plan stupid) and a sensible plot."
7," They did good with what they had but it falls short in the end
",ameen2004,/user/ur130945325/,23 November 2022,"Speaking as someone who doesn't like MCU movies, this honestly was pretty good. It didnt have the stuff that normally annoys me about Marvel movies like constant corny jokes, bad CGI, or obviously one sided fights. The world of Wakanda is very immersive and they take a lot of stuff from real African cultures to make it. They also did a very good job of making a story independent of T'Challa after Chadwick Boseman's death. Shuri is a great character who I enjoyed watching become queen.The main problem lies with the villain and the ending. The villain's motive is very confusing and his behavior is too irrational to understand. He comes off as passive aggressive in one scene, then friendly in the next, and then causes unnecessary conflict by capturing Shuri. Then the ending really ruins it for me. Shuri sparing him is such a disappointing ending. After he kills her mother and she gets a vision from Killmonger telling her that she needs to avenge her, she still decides ""uhhh both sides are bad"" and makes peace. The villain should've been more clearly antagonistic and Shuri should've killed him. Not everything needs to be a wholesome ending."
6," Really wanted to like this
",katz000,/user/ur8599760/,23 November 2022,"The first Black Panther was fabulous and I really wanted to like this one. But despite the great actors, it's clear that Chadwick Boseman left a hole too big to fill with his untimely death. I caught myself looking at my watch half an hour in - not a good sign. It feels strangely bloated and far too long. It felt like it needed a really good edit to bring it down to less than two hours. The blue people felt like they belonged in a different movie like Avatar? Strangely, I did not care much about the characters that much this time around - maybe we've had too many superhero movies. A little disappointed."

",francescoy-72516,/user/ur158924215/,23 November 2022,"In recent days, the vision of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever could not be missed. Film that closes Phase 4 of Marvel and is also the first without Chadwick Boseman. Overall it is one of the best films of its stage. We had been promised by the director, producers and cast a solemn film in memory of the real Black Panther ... and so it was. The real protagonist of this film? Wakanda. The villain of this movie? There is not. Yes, because Namor is not that. Let's start right from the new entry. Basically I didn't mind at all how this character was reinvented due to the many similarities with Aquaman. The interpretation, on the other hand, is nothing in particular that can be remembered. The soundtrack department chosen for the city of Namor, on the other hand, I adored to madness. But let's come to the surface, more precisely to Wakanda. All the traditions staged are very beautiful .... but Shuri's narrative development is so hateful and flat that I ""rooted"" against her (but for Namor). The most successful character on dry land and who steals the show from everyone is undoubtedly Mbaku (yes hell!!). The new...ah no new Iron Man (Riri Wiliam/Iron Heart) has just been introduced, so let's skip it.In conclusion, the tones, soundtrack / music and the character of Namor are good. The duration of the film could be reduced (perhaps by removing the new Iron Man). Ah yes I don't agree with the choice of who will take the role of Black Panther alas."

",lpfreakforever,/user/ur2513397/,23 November 2022,"I told myself from the get go, in Coogler and Feige I trust. I was not wrong. Ryan Coogler had his hands full with this installment, he doesn't disappoint.The opening Marvel Title Card roles in with images of Chadwick Boseman in complete silence. We the fans get the opportunity to have our moment of silence before we are brought back to Wakanda to mourn our fallen hero.Wakanda Forever allows us to pay tribute to Boseman by leaning into our real world loss. Letitia Wright is tasked with not only shouldering a massive franchise but also at the loss of her late costar. She's exceptional. Angela Bassett comes in as Queen Ramonda and delivers an Oscar worthy performance.Returning cast Nyong'o, Gurira, Freeman, and Duke get a chance to step up and get some great scenes. They help keep this all glued together and help Wright as she is passed the mantle.Dominique Thorne gets to have some good screen time to introduce us to Riri, we will see more of her soon. Tenoch Huerta gives us one of our new mutants, Namor. It could be said he equally had to shoulder the challenge of following up Jordan's Killmonger. Not an easy feat, but well executed.The film is grander, more vibrant, and beautifully orchestrated. Coogler did what many probably couldn't have. Wakanda Forever is a solid closure to Phase Four of the MCU."
6," New cat on the block
",Horst_In_Translation,/user/ur3914439/,23 November 2022,"""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is of course the long-awaited sequel to the incredibly successful ""Black Panther"" film from 2018 that became one of the most socially relevant films of its year and also one of the big players during the then following awards season. I think it is safe to say that in both fields this movie here will not make equally huge waves as the previous one, but from my perspective this sequel here I'd say is maybe even the superior movie from the two. Many will disagree and as you can see from my rating I was also not blown away by it, but I enjoyed it and I was definitely nicely entertained. There were even parts when I considered giving the film an even higher rating and 4 stars out of 5 or 8 out of 10 I could also say is nothing that really happens extremely often for me. I'd still say a 60% approval is fitting and accurate now. Of course, you did not have to do without the characters for four years since 2018 as there were other Marvel films in-between where the characters were included. The director and also writer here is again Ryan Coogler of course. I see he has worked on quite a few Black-themed films for years now, so I'd be curious to see him also for once shoot a movie away from race-related issues. Just like his co-writer Joe Robert Cole has done in the past for example. He even made a very White film on one occasion and he is also a director himself, but with this film here, the directing was all up to Coogler and today we will mostly talk about this film. It is an extremely long movie, even for Marvel standards at over 160 minutes including credits. The biggest challenge they had was basically deal with the untimely death of Chadwick Boseman, the Black Panther from the first film. I liked what they did with that. The film was a decent tribute and while references to Boseman in the film in terms of the plot were frequent, it never felt forced or like fake tearjerker material. For me personally, the opening was the most touching aspect maybe, how they included the Marvel opening they always use as a tribute to Boseman only. That almost turned my eyes a little wet there, also because it was in black-and-white. May he rest in peace.As for the rest of the cast, you will find many familiar faces here. Letitia Wright takes over as Shuri and becomes the new Black Panther as the film goes on, which was not expected from my side I will admit. Fans of the show ""The Walking Dead"" will be happy again to see Danai Gurira. I must say I never liked her character on TWD, but here she is okay. Winston Duke is pure muscle and entertaining. Angela Bassett I was surprised how much I liked her performance, she may even have been the MVP. I was never too big on her, so definitely a positive surprise. Dominique Thorne I think she was the one who played the prodigy. She did not do a lot for me and in general I think her story was also too close Paquin's character's on X-Men for me. Another young female with very special abilities. I would have preferred a better story line there. I also disliked a lot that was linked to her character such as the idea that she knows all these things, is basically a young female Black Einstein and that her professors and other world-famous scientists are apparently clueless compared to her. But also the idea how the main antagonist really wants to kill her at first, but then changes his plan if Wakanda decides to join forces with him. He could have killed her right away and still tried to pull through with his other plan. I also found it strange that Wakanda really wanted to save the girl. I mean with what the humans did to them with this attack there that surely backfired for the human side, they absolutely could not have cared. There is no real profit for the Wakandans there coming from saving the girl, only that they make a very powerful enemy.But I was talking about the cast yep. So of course Martin Freeman is in here too, but by now I am really bored and even annoyed by him, except in Fargo maybe, so I am glad he did not have too much screen time. The revelation that all of a sudden Julia Louis-Dreyfus from ""Seinfeld"" and ""Veep"" plays not only his boss, but also his ex-wife was very much on the cringeworthy side. The interactions between those two were unwatchable at times I must say, even if admittedly personal bias from my side played a role there as well. Don't like JLD at all with her political comments and I also think she is fairly overrated as an actress, especially as a comedic actress. So it would have been nicer if the rare inclusion of White actors here could have been handled in a more convincing fashion. Only positive words on the other hand I have for Mexican actor Tenoch Huerta or Tenoch Huerta MejÃ­a. Baffling to see he has been in the industry for 15 years already and if we ignore small roles in stuff like ""Mozart in the Jungle"", it took until now for his Hollywood breakthrough to happen. What a force of nature he was in this film. I liked almost everything about his character here and ideas like his ankles having wings could have become quickly ridiculous or embarrassing, but the way he portrayed it, this worked out well too. He is perhaps the character with the second-most screen time in this extremely long movie and what a breakthrough this was! I hope he gets some awards recognition for his turn and also that it will help him to get featured in future Hollywood films, maybe also work with the trifecta of brilliant Mexican Oscar-winning directors now: AC, GDT and AGI. Or also work with others with great potential that are on the rise. He was quite a joy to watch in all his scenes and the problem I had for a moment there when after he is defeated by Black Panther he just succumbs and tells his folks to stop fighting and accept Wakanda's superiority instead vanished quickly when we see a conversation between him and his closest ally at the very end in which we find out about his motives and that he may still be evil. Huerta did well in portraying a god here. At least this is how he is perceived by his own.The minor struggles I had were only indirectly linked to him, like how the two prisoners were freed far too easily by a character that felt very strange to me, namely by Lupita Nyong'o's. I guess they wanted to do something with this Oscar winner, but this definitely did not feel like the right path. But this and some of the other stuff I mentioned earlier were already almost all the criticisms I had, so not too much for a film this long and as I also stated earlier already, I think this movie was closer to greatness than to being a weak film, but ""good"" or ""alright"" seem like fitting adjectives as a whole. Nyong'o, who strangely enough got second credit here according to imdb, was also featured in the brief post-credit sequence with a big revelation to her character. I will not go into detail there, but this scene seemed very much like closure to me, even if I wonder if this film will also be another big hit and most of all very successful commercially, if Coogler then will not agree to return with at least one more, thus a third movie. Another director I would almost rule out completely as this is his franchise. Then again, I am sure he will have many other interesting projects waiting, like the one he scored his Oscar nomination for, even if there he did not direct. So yeah, very different post-credit sequence here compared to the Thor movie that showed us a new main antagonist on the radar and that this will definitely not be the end of it all. But here I could also imagine they go on with a film that might again feature Huerta considerably, maybe even from a perspective like Loki's where we can never be sure if he is one of the good guys or still a bad guy. The idea that his people must not be known to the outside world is crucial here and if Wakanda had informed humanity about them, then his revenge might have been even more devastating than it was anyway with what he did to Bassett's character and at the same time also to Letitia Wright's character of course. Great deal of loss for her in this film.The idea of how she must not let revenge cloud her judgment was only so-so for me. It came a bit abrupt that she let the main antagonist live in the end, but as this plot idea/twist brought back Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger, even if only in one scene, I am all for it. Coogler has worked with Jordan so much, so it is no huge surprise these two are reunited here again. Of course, he is not the main antagonist again. The main antagonist is dealt with helped by the relatively simple idea that heat does some serious damage to fish (people). Even if they are (seen as) gods. But it was also funny to see orcas for example throw the soldiers of the bad guy high up in the air and right in the place where they would be ready to fight Wakandans. So there is some really nice attention to detail here. And I was surely also not the only one who while watching this film saw the characters called blue people here and immediately made the reference to Avatar as of course the second Avatar film is also finally being released very soon. Quite a year for blue fighter characters you could say, even if those in Avatar do not really have a connection to water only, but if you elaborate on that, then they are linked to nature altogether. That is another story though. A few more words in terms of brainstorming on this film here. You will recognize Lake Bell early on perhaps playing one of the unlucky characters and in the cast list I even see Trevor Noah. Now he alone would be reason enough to not be too enthusiastic about this one. Even if his role is small, no clue what they were thinking. He is not an actor. That is all then. ""Wakanda Forever"" deserves to be seen. Go for it. Still, I must end the review by saying I do not like the idea that a character named after a radical and violent group is supposed to be seen as caring and likable hero."
9," What a film
",chrissy-49738,/user/ur158866744/,23 November 2022,Okay so let's start by saying like many I had high expectations for this film and let me tell you it for sure didn't disappoint it had a little of everything heart humor action and good story this was such a lovely tribute to chad I myself even cried so much going on here so little time that's one reason I recommend it though so fast paced and fun for the entire family just about.and the wakanda storyline was extremely good as well so much to squeeze into 2..40 but every bit of it is fun and a good time you might want to think before taking youngest of kids but that's my only gripe due to intense violence but aside from that a perfect film.
1," I am a die hard Marvel fan but I have to admit I was really disappointed in the Black Panther sequel.
",ActionMovieDude,/user/ur65188668/,22 November 2022,"I absolutely love comic book movies. I love both Marvel AND DC equally, so no one can accuse me of being biased in my review of Black Panther Wikanda Forever.I absolutely loved the first Black Panther movie which was released at the absolute pinnacle of Marvel cinematic popularity. He was the latest and greatest Avenger back in.2018.The great thing about the original Black Panther was that it gave African Americans a hero of their own to cherish within the Marvel universe which is what th late great Stan Lee wanted from the beginning of it all.However ever since the release of Endgame back in 2019, it seem the quality of Marvel films has been slipping, from very disappointing Marvel shows like She-Hul, to Wandavision, to the release of Love and Thunder it seems that the quality of Marvel films has taken s serious nosedive.Black Panther Wikanda Forever, I'm sorry to say is no different from most of the Marvel films from the very disappointing Phase Four of this cinematic universe. WIth the recent passing of Chadwick Boseman, it's a film without a soul of a center. It's simply a film about people coming to grieve, without a real story or purpose.Characters are given no motivation or conflict, and the film needlessly DRAGS on for nearly three hours.This film in fact felt more like a Disney Plus film. But instead was released because Disney has been losing a lot of money lately.I hate to say it but I found the recently released Black Adam starring Dwayne Johnson to be a far more enjoyable film than Black Panther 2, and I'm saying this as a dis hard Marvel fan.Disney has turned Stan Lee's awesome creations into noting more than a way to give the executives at Disney bonus paychecks rather than pleasing their fans, if they don't right this ship, the public will soon become tired of comic book movies just like the public became tired of Star Wars after Disney ruined that cinematic franchise with poor writing and dull characters.If Marvel and Disney continue to put out subpar films like Black Panther 2 and the upcoming The. Marvels, you can bet the fanbase will abandon it just like they did other film franchises."
9," More than I expected
",Foxriver1,/user/ur13750287/,22 November 2022,"In Endgame, Tony Stark had a funeral tribute of 2 maybe 3 minytes! This entire movie is a great to
Boseman, and to the the legacy that started woth the first Black Panther movie. It would have been a perfest 10 if the hadnt lowered Shuri's and Wakanda's in general scientific achievements- thibking about the Black Panther- the tech leadership
was much more pronounced in the first movie than here!One of the maximum forte of the movie is Angela Basset! Totally, 100 000% believable in the role of the Worlds most powerful country.This
movie works great as a standalone, as well as the part of the saga. I know I will definitely enjoy rewatching it."
7," Part Meh, Part Great
",aaaaaron-frannnnnnnn,/user/ur117043494/,22 November 2022,"I will talk about the ""Meh"" points first. Namor, despite the actual actor being pretty compelling, his whole plot was rushed. Martin Freeman is such a cool actor but his character Agent Ross was not needed at all. Lastly, Iron Heart's introduction was 100% rushed. I like how they used her getting kidnapped as one of the main plot points, then when it no longer made sense, Namor is like ""oh yeah, she doesnt matter anymore"". As if they literally forgot they made her a part of the script.But as for the Great parts of the movie. The ""hero's journey"" segment of Shuri, and the struggles she goes through was incredible. Along side with the Royal Family's drama with the Queen and Okuye. Also introducing Aneka (the lady with the daggers) was SUPER cool. She wasn't even a main character but they set her up perfectly. M'baku was pretty well written in this movie as well. For me, the acting with Angela Basset (the queen) and Letecia Wright (Shuri) was the thing that made this movie actually pretty dang good.Overall, it felt like they had this ""Family Drama"" movie perfectly written. Then they had to to get Namor and throw a plot together for him and insert him into this movie."
7," Honestly... Marvel/Disney should have recast T'Challa
",hfreinoso,/user/ur65697588/,22 November 2022,"Black Panther Wakanda Forever was a movie I was hesitant to watch because, as many know, Chadwick Boseman has passed away from cancer, and it was hard to know that Kevin Feige was NOT going to recast the character and instead kill off T'Challa. And I have a massive problem with that because we have yet to explore the nature of T'Challa, and the story should have continued what Boseman started. And not kill the character just because the actor died. So Ryan Coogler had a tough job changing the new script and making a new story, and while I respect what he does and all the movies he writes and directs are exceptional; So I can expect to see, a movie with full 100% of heart that he cares. And of course, he does put his heart and soul. However, sadly, I am one of those people who wanted them to recast T'Challa than have him die in the universe. I wish they'd done this story as a show instead of a movie because there were so many elements that just didn't get enough time to be developed. Shuri simply has no agency for most of the film. We don't have time to see if she's mourning the loss of her brother, trying to deny the grief, struggling with the concept of having to someday lead her people or working through expectations put in place by her mother. We get little glimpses of these ideas, but not enough time to explore any of them. As a result, Shuri is just kinda ""there"" while the plot revolves around her, which sucks since she's the main character. I like how much more mature she is than in the first movie. She was better here and I did enjoy seeing her on a journey to find herself with her religious beliefs. Her questioning religion is a sight to see and needed more to explore. I did love Tenoch Huerta as Namor, he is brilliant as Namor, however, I still wish it was Atlantis and was their version of Atlantis that rivals Aquaman. Angela Bassett, I have nothing to say but she was the best part of this movie, and I did enjoy the performance she gave, but to me, she didn't need to die. I wanted her to continue the story of a struggle Queen. Riri Williams played by Dominique Thorne didn't work for me. I don't know what it is, but to me, I feel like we didn't need her, and she was nothing but a plot device for the movie and the story. And we don't even know why Wakanda wants to protect her if she is a random nobody, with just brains. Again, it's gotten so lazy to see someone with the gift of knowledge, but she is quite a one-dimensional character. Overall the movie is fine to me; I feel like if they kept the original story (Where T'Challa returns from the dead and he had to continue his journey as king and the story with him against Namor would have been miles better.) But again that's just me. 7/10. Still respect Ryan Coogler for what he did with this film."
6," A nice tribute, but not much else.
",dave_maguire,/user/ur45782531/,22 November 2022,"The passing of Chadwick Boseman was a terrible tragedy however this film addresses this and deals with it in a respectful manner. I've seen people complain that T'Challa ""Just died off screen of an illness"" however I don't see a issue with this, after all Captain Marvel died of Cancer in the comics years ago so, whilst it's not named as the illness, I don't think it was a problem to have a ""real world"" reason.What I did have an issue with was the Wakandan Tech. In the first movie Everett Ross is shot, and they stick a bead in his body which keeps him alive because - reasons! In this one we have Shuri 3D printing synthetic Heart shaped herbs to recreate the Black Panther. I'm not a scientist, but I don't see how you can create a herb with the same nutritional values on a 3d printer - certainly not one that has magical properties?! Even moreso when all the herbs were destroyed in the previous film so how would know what was in the herb to start with?But I digress.... Unfortunately the film massively suffers to the missing T'Challa, I never really took to Shuri in the first film and feel that she is not a strong enough character to be a able to carry the film as a lead - whether this be due to Letitia Wright's potrayal or the writing, something just didn't work for me with her.Angela Bassett however was great and showed real emotion and passion in every scene she was in, I also enjoyed Tenich Huerta as Namor and found him to be one of the better antagonists in a marvel film of late, and would like to see him again in future projects. And as always the supporting cast were great, even if we could've done with more Okoye and M'Baku.What I could have done with a lot less of was the abundance of characters included purely to world build and set up future projects. Lets start with Everett Ross - for starters I'm not sure how someone so quintessentially british as Morgan Freeman managed to get this role given how awful his american accent is, but he has no need to be in this film and is purely there to setup the Thunderbolts with Valentina Allegra de blah blah - no need for any of these scenes they were in at all and completely took you out of the story. The other who had no need to be in this film was ""Riri"" - What an annoying character! Whiny, sarcastic, arrogant and a vocabulary just full of ""Damn"" and ""Aw hell no's"". I actually thought i was watching Jaden Smith's character from The Karate Kid! Riri who could've been subbed in for any scientist, is technically intrical to the plot after creating a machine to find Vibranium, though quite how she did this is a mystery to me when she appears to be working out of an abandoned garage. But has also managed to create a variant of an Iron Man suit, complete with an arc reactor? I understand Tony Stark built this, in a cave, with a box of scraps, but how on earth did she accomplish that!?All of this world building leads to an unecessarily long run time and the film's pacing suffers because of this and there are sections of the film that really drag, and even after this time you still feel you haven't seen much of the main cast.The final battle is your typical third act fight, where after a devastatingly tragic attack, the heroes suit up, in some awful new costumes for Okoye, and a very strange looking IronHeart suit, to fight off the evil villians. The fight with Shuri and Namor is quite viceral and brutal, however you are immediately taken out of it when Shuri is stabbed right through her stomach with a spear. For a second I actually wondered if they were going to kill off most of the main cast, however she is comfortably able to fight on and show no after effects - even being able to wear a top showing her midsection in the final scenes with no sign of the wound - not even a sratch?!The film ends with a touching tribute to Chadwick Boseman and a beatiful song by Rhianna which will leave a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye. People have spoken about what will happen in Black Panther 3, however given how the film ends, I don't know that there will BE one as I can't see where the franchise goes next.All in all, not one of the best Marvel films released, hopefuly with the end of phase 4 comes the end of the disappointing releases. (Spiderman NWH excluded) It's a worry that the quality of the MCU has dropped ever since the Infinity War saga. Hopefully Quantumania will put them back on track.Though that being said at least it's not a awful as Thor: Love and Thunder!"
6," Postcolonial Superhero Flick
",Saif_Hindawy,/user/ur45315009/,22 November 2022,"Out of the superhero hype lately, the Black Panther comics have not received the attention they deserve. For the idea behind the comics themselves is smart and underrated. It is sometimes dismissed as just a token diversity attempt, a lazy attempt at inclusion. The same way they make a supergirl for superman and such. However, the Wakanda setting is well thought of and adds a sociopolitical commentary that is philosophical rich. In the context of postcolonialism it uses it's fantastical world as a thought experiment. Asking the question of what would have happened if there was a secret African nation hidden from the world that is more advanced technologically and socially than any Western power. Should they use this power to unite disenfranchised and marginalized Africans around the world making a new world power? Should they share their technology and resources with the rest of the world given the history of colonization and imperialism. However, the most prominent question is the matter of vengeance, if these hidden nations had the power to destroy and subjugate the previous imperial powers, should they exact this revenge?In this movie, however, it just feels like nothing is particularly added in terms of concept, but only a new kind of Wakanda based on a hidden Mayan civilization rather than an African one. This Mayan civilization is hidden in an Atlantis like fashion with the inhabitants taking a transhuman form that is more fitting with their new aquatic lives. The leader of this civilization wants to exact vengeance on the entire world of surface dwellers and wants Wakanda as an ally rather than as an enemy. The plot itself is filled with cliches and still very much feels like a superhero blockbuster.What really carries the movie is the costume design, aesthetic elements, architecture, etc. The movie is filled with beautiful scenes and is really rich in terms of trying to capture the cultures and historical heritage it is trying to present through this fictional hidden civilization.In terms of entertainment the movie is not as funny and the action not as captivating as the first movie. Some of the battles are unrealistic and feel unnatural. I would still recommend this movie to lovers of the Marvel Universe and the superhero genre in general."
2," Over Hyped
",richardaldcroft-10222,/user/ur156720194/,22 November 2022,"Sadly this movie was exactly what I expected it to be. Over hyped and lacking. Does a great injustice to the marvel franchise. Story, if you can call it that, was dull and so very boring. Only thing keeping it alive in theatres is mass marketing and duped fans. It was sold as the greatest adventure and tribute ever made...lol. What a joke. Plain and simple truth is, they used the memory of Chadwick to draw people in. And that's a crying shame.Besides the complete lack of story, Disney hit the viewers with the usual agendas, and boy o boy did they really pour it on. Which only served to make the movie feel awkward and distasteful. And I'm sure I speak for many when I say, it's getting old already. And seriously, Disney has become a platform for fueling racism. I wish people would wake up.One thing I did enjoy while watching this was the 8-12 people who got up and left half way through. That was entertaining, for the last half of the film all I could think was I should of left as well."
7," Sleep inducingly dark
",Spectec,/user/ur0410038/,22 November 2022,"Following the trend of other films and TV shows, many scenes were graded way too dark and/or lit poorly. To the point where several of us were drifting off in the theatre.And that's in a good theatre, with an IMAX screen - not on an OLED TV.Beyond that, the movie needed more room to breathe. Several characters were underdeveloped to the point of not being believable. It felt like it should have been two films - one to deal with the loss of Chadwick Boseman in narrative form, and another to introduce the new storylines.In summation, Black Panther isn't meant to describe the brightness levels."
8," My opinion on the New BP movie
",mjmirando,/user/ur110080639/,22 November 2022,"Before watching the movie A distant friend informed me that this movie was not good at all. Hence, I went to watch this movie with a lot of negative thoughts that this movie is going to be terrible as experienced with Black Adam. However, I thought that this movie was amazing from the start to the very end the story was so intreating and I love watching it. But my friends rated this movie a 7/10 which I'm not sure why they did so as the movie was amazing to me.However, I thought that Letitia Wright was a bit overacting and I didn't like her acting as much as the other characters who were in the movie as the other characters did justice for this movie and their acting was amazing.Overall it's surely a movie that you should not miss and it's a must-watch with family & friends."
4," A touching tribute....but....
",dupregalaxy,/user/ur96244164/,22 November 2022,"Plenty of reviews, but now let's look at the plot holes.Starts strong but seems to lose something along the way.A very well made tribute to T'Challa, but not sure how the series will go on with Shuri as the new Black Panther.Let's consider the fact that in a leadership challenge the Black Panther is stripped of his or her powers. How will she face her challenger physically.I didn't understand myself that with the risk of the Wakandans being wiped out, why did they lead with one Black Panther instead of multiple? Shuri has always been one to go against the grain, and be driven by intellect and innovation, why wouldn't she think of this herself considering that their religious beliefs have now been debunked with Vibranium been found outside Wakanda.Desperate times did not lead to desperate measures in this circumstance. Since Disney are so keen on going girl power, you'd think that Okoye would have been the obvious choice. A formidable fighter without the heart shaped herb and has been loyal to Wakanda placing her beliefs above all.At this rate Wakanda won't be forever."
9," A worthwhile sequel
",jojifrey,/user/ur30437634/,22 November 2022,"What makes it worthwhile was the villain MCU chose for Wakandans. A nemesis who garnered a substantial sympathy for his cause in waging war on the world.Another good thing is by avoiding the trailers & spoilers, I really didn't see a new character coming to challenge Black Panther.Too many plot lines? Really? They were just about the right amount, and the director was weaving all the plots into one great story as expected from any MCU movie.I won't say much about the plot, besides, the actions were great, some choices seemed obviously dumb, but a fun kind of dumbness.Overall, it's a great mourning movie for reminiscing the late Chadwick Boseman."
7," A little disappointing but good enough to end phase 4
",kenc-05236,/user/ur128794129/,22 November 2022,"First thing, it was nice how they sent off T'Challa (RIP Chadwick Boseman) but maybe I set my hopes up a little to high but with how phase 1 ended with the Avengers and phase 3 ended with Avengers: Endgame (yes i know it actually with far from home but to me it really feels like the intro to phase 4) I was hoping for bang. Even then with it not finishing phase 4 but as a stand alone movie it feels just good and that's it. There are some cool moments like when entering Talokan or Namor's back story (Namor was the best part, if you can't tell) however when spread across a 2hr 40min runtime there's some slow moments. But then I dont know what would be cut if the runtime had to be cut down so I'm sure if the runtime is justified.Everything else in the movie was good, that's it just good (except Ironheart girl who sucks and Namor who's great) I just loved Namor from his motive to how he moves like he's running through air with his winged feet. In the end it just a movie with a good villain with just good enough everything else."
10," Chadwick Boseman 1976 - 2020, forever T' Challa.
",DarkVulcan29,/user/ur4593705/,21 November 2022,"I was wondering if they could pull of the series after Chadwick Boseman passed away in 2020, but surprisingly they pulled it off perfectly, while at the same time honoring his memory.The actors do pretty well. Even Angela Bassett who gives an oscar worthy performance this time. Action scenes and the effects are nothing short of spectacular. The Introduction of the Namor character is also well done. It's almost three hours, but it flows by very well. Battle scenes are pretty epic , almost like in the first one. I'm looking where there gonna keep going with this story, the story of Wakanda is a joy."
6," It was tough one
",TopFiv3,/user/ur159089456/,21 November 2022,"After Chad's death in real life, it was tough for the writers to incorporate it to the movie. They did try though and made it simple but crowd did not buy it that much. Old cast was still great but losing another main character in the same movie was tragic. Bringing in a new and powerful new city was a great addition to future story. Future ally or a close enemy of the Wakanda people. The twist in the end might bring a new face for the franchise depending on who they get to play the male Black Panther. I still believe it Black Panther would still do great sequels in the future once they bring in other Marvel Character in their movies."
3," No logic plot at all
",navarrete72-530-22621,/user/ur37806040/,21 November 2022,"This movie has a bad writing like many things nowadaysthe ""plot(s)"" don't make sense at all, or the supposed conflict.Supposedly the girl genius is a threat, why, she came up with a formula or design and the government already created a device with it. They have the construction design, not her, she doesn't matter anymoreThe ship discovered vibranium, people were asked to come and investigate more, so the location is already known. Anyone can mine it now, if attacked, that will be unprovoked attack and rightly excuse to sanction and attack those who will attack the mining site. No-one has rights over it.The Blue people pretty much destroyed the Wakandas, Namor could have killed the black panther, even could have taken the girl after the attack to wakanda, they proved to be stronger and better organized.The high ground at the end doesn't make any sense, nothing there make sense."
6," A Really Weird One Which Was Disappointing and Didn't Meet the Expectation...
",MamadNobari97,/user/ur45507551/,21 November 2022,"... Even though I didn't expect much from this movie anyway.So first of all, let me say that they did a good job of sending off Boseman's T'challa, though I actually expected a way longer tribute than what we actually got. But it was a good one nonetheless.I didn't really like having Shuri as BP at first, and I still don't think she really has the same charisma as Chadwick for the main role protagonist, especially as the main Black Panther. It's just that she works better as a side character, at least in this universe and in this movie. But as the movie goes on, they give her more characterization fortunately and she becomes a decent character by the end, and I really don't have a problem with her being the Black Panther now.Though with the unfortunate passing of Chadwick Boseman, his absence is felt big time in this movie, especially in the first and second acts. And that might be what they were going for and you think it helps the movie that there's not a real protagonist yet, but in my opinion, not replacing T'Challa's actor or at least having his wife be the Black Panther really hurt the narrative and the movie as a whole. Because half of the movie passes and you wonder what even happened and who's the protagonist, and like I said, Shuri's actress is just not as charismatic as Boseman was and it hurts the movie. So it might've been a good choice not to recast him, but in my opinion, the negatives in this regard outway the positives, and the first two acts could've benefited from a more charismatic protagonist. And it's not like she doesn't have charisma, they write those first acts in a way that there isn't much focus on her like the movie doesn't even consider her the protagonist either. And again, this might've been intentional to convey the loss, but I didn't appreciate it and would've rather better writing.This made the movie less enjoyable than the first one and the tone of the movie was really weird too. It felt like a fever dream to be honest, it was stuck in a limbo of not being sure whether to be completely somber and serious or be a little light-hearted in between too. Most of the attempts at jokes fail miserably again and some of them feel out of place. This whole thing made the movie feel really weird and not that enjoyable, not to mention the movie was way too long for its own good and could've shaved off a lot of scenes, especially the jokes. Movies like Doctor Strange 2 would've benefited from 20 minutes more and this movie could've benefited from 20 or 10 minutes less. The whole thing kinda feels disjointed for some reason, even though it isn't. So the narrative of this movie is really weird and I liked how they did the first movie way better.Before continuing to point out negative after negative, let me also say what I liked about this movie;Angela Bassett is amazing in this movie and she is a great actressShuri's character arc in this movie is really good and she earns the Black Panther by the endThe action scenes are better than the first movie'sNamor's backstory is interesting but his actions and decisions make himThe third act is actually not that badThe music is once again one of the best parts of the movieIncorporating Riri Williams (not Ironheart) in the story was not that bad but it was obvious why they did itThe Ancestral Plane scene!Namor's fight scenes are surprisingly not that goofy and his action scenes are actually entertaining and funFinally a good post-credit scene, and probably the best post-credit scene in Phase 4. But the scene should've been in the movie, it's really weird to have it as the post credit-scene.And I think that's it, I don't really think I enjoyed the other things in this movie that much.Now back to the negatives and what I didn't like;Even though Riri Williams' introduction is good and they make it makes sense for the story, Ironheart isn't and I don't really care about Ironheart, especially when it's a goofy ahh power rangers suit. Her goofy colorful suit doesn't belong in this movie at all. Yes, it's even goofier and more out-of-place than Namor's feet wings and Midnight Angel's suits. It is obvious they did this shoehorning to have more people watch her series when it comes out on Disney+. And like I said, her being in the story kinda made sense and wasn't that bad, but Ironheart just wasn't it. I don't even remember if she had a ""big marvel reveal with heroic music"" moment or not, that's how much I care about this power ranger.Namor is an interesting character, but they don't really do a good job with him in this movie. At least they try to give him backstory and characterization with him having more scenes, unlike the wasted Christian Bale in Thor 4. And he's not in the movie that much to begin with. They have him expositioning his own backstory and expositioning himself to characterization, and it turns out that he's another ""someone did an oopsie to my parents and I want to destroy all life on earth mwahahaha"" villain we've seen a million times before. The previous movie had a much better villain, and even though they kinda have the same backstory, at least the first one was more personal to the protagonist and that made you care more about it.The whole conflict between Wakanda and Talokan is weird and Namor's reasonings don't really make sense.The first two acts, especially the second one are not that good or enjoyable. Though surprisingly the third act was actually good and it looked better than the CGI-fest ending of the first movie. Even though the strategy of their fight didn't really make sense, I thought at least the fight between Shuri and Namor was decent and I like the third act more than the first two despite expecting it to be the worst part of the movie before watching it based on the previous Phase 4 projects.Everett Ross was whatever in this movie and you could take out him and the other particular character that's with him out of the movie and nothing changes. Felt like they were obligated to have him and the other person in the movie for some reason, even though they didn't impact the story or the outcome that much or at all.The script is just not that great and it is too shallow and simple. Phase 4 writing has been bad to mediocre at best. They either need to find better writers or give them more time to come up with better ideas and better scripts.The lengthTiniest amount of focus on how the whole world reacted to Wakanda exposing themselves and how the world of MCU is changing with the newer discoveries and technologies, something we never see in these movies and shows that much.I really really really hate the nano-auto-dematerializing helmets and masks every, single, MCU, character is getting for a long time now. Like it's at a point that I can't not notice and shake my head every time we see a new character and his/her helmet just disappears easily so they can talk. It's lazy and makes every superhero in this universe not unique and samey. I hate this lazy trend and I wish they ditched this instantly dematerializing mask trend everyone has. Not to mention that everyone is apparently going to have the Tony Stark inside the suit close-up scenes.All in All, I did not enjoy this movie as much as I wanted because I really didn't like the vibe of the movie and the script is not that great. The movie doesn't really take advantage of its lengthy run-time and wastes it on unnecessary scenes. I liked their tribute to Boseman's Black Panther and I liked the ending of the movie a lot, but overall, I didn't enjoy the movie that much and this could've been a way better movie if they had just spent more time fixing the script."
8," Wakanda Forever!
",marshallclaudia1,/user/ur29550608/,21 November 2022,"I haven't read all the other reviews but I would gladly go see this movie again. Wakanda Forever is a tribute to Chadwick Bozeman and the grieving nation of Wakanda. It really deals with loss in the first hour. We deal with the Queen's loss and Shurri 's denial of what is happening. She, Shurri seems to blame herself for not being able to help her brother through his illness and all the guilt of what didn't I do when someone dies. Angela Bassett is awesome in this film her headwear, dress and demeanor are phenomenal. Kudos to the wardrobe mistress for this film. They are trying to move on when Namor's nation attacks and they are dealing with a threat to there nation and Wakanda is answering the call to protect not only themselves but someone who they've invested in. Glimpses of an Iron Man suit the young lady is brilliant. The movie is beautiful and you should get the idea that everyone is looking for something purpose, peace? Great surprise at the end and the promise of another Black Panther. I'm not a critic. I'm a lover of the promise of Wakanda."
2," chat...chat...chat...
",drjgardner,/user/ur44482045/,21 November 2022,"If this was supposed to be a day-time soap opera with lots of 2-shots with people talking, then they did their job well. The Queen talks to her daughter. The Queen talks to her General. The General talks to the Princess. After 20 minutes of this they have a 2-minute action scene, and then back to chat...chat...chat. Everyone chats. Even the dead people chat. There can't be more than 10 minutes cumulative of action, and the action sequences are poor. CGI is poor and combat is poor. Even the music is poor. What the heck did they think they were doing? The basic idea of a Brown and Black coalition is good but was squandered here."
6," Eye candy
",drz,/user/ur0688704/,21 November 2022,"... that is passable as a movie, but feels more like a lost opportunity than a victory. The story is childish yet gory, the acting is mediocre, but action and visuals are pretty good. The thinly (if at all) veiled central theme appears to be the promotion of a race-based alliance against colonial powers, though its tribal and militaristic approach makes the message simply threatening rather than serving as a true counter-narrative to centuries-long wrongdoing. The movie lacks the originality, the uplifting message and the quality of acting of its prequel, and its end reduces the whole thing to being a bridge to a sequel. Yet it was entertaining and truly cringe-worthy moments are few and far in between."
10," Amazing!
",rubenoftheorchard,/user/ur39964759/,21 November 2022,"Amazing! Best thing Marvel has put out since Spider-Man: No way Home. Generally amazing, great story, great action, peril, but the stand out thing for me was the costume design. Even if you have never seen a marvel or superhero movie before you would still like it because of the beauty of it. This movie makes me excited for the future of marvel. Not gonna lie, it was going downhill for a bit... but it's like, Marvel's back. If you were wondering whether or not to see it, the answer is yes. Left me in awe. So refreshing to see a great move again. Honestly favorite movie of 2022 (2nd to everything everywhere all at once). Anyways, yeah it's good. See it!"
9," A wonderful film marred with odd character motivations
",tjosephubert,/user/ur39416308/,21 November 2022,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It managed to deliver spectacle while interweaving organic sadness into the core of the film. With that said, it had a sombre (yet somewhat inconsistent) tone. From the first images of the film, you notice that care has gone into making this film a tribute to the late portrayer of the Black Panther, Chadwick Bozeman. They deliver homage in a way that makes the continuation of the Black Panther feel okay - something I wasn't expecting. Before actually watching the film, I had half heartedly believed they should have just retired the character out of respect. I'm glad they took a different approach. Instead, characters deliver amazing raw performances (no doubt drawing from the death of their friend and former costar).One of the greatest parts of this film is spectacle, to which it delivers copious amounts. Although that is commonplace for Marvel movies, the cinematography and effects were well done in this entry - more so than some of their other recent projects. The vistas, namely the futuristic city of Wakanda, look more beautiful than ever. Additionally, there is also a new dazzling location, but I will leave that unnamed to avoid spoilers. The movie is, for lack of a better term, eye candy.Like all Marvel movies, the action sequences are the main attraction. While they are not as abundant as other Marvel movies, they do pack a nice punch - pun intended. They serve as a good break to the relatively slow pace of the film, with the climax rewarding viewers with a great payoff.For the most part, it is a great film. It does struggle with is character motivations and character driven plot points. In my opinion, they are the most poorly constructed parts of the movie. Characters go back on their word, change their mind on the fly, and show little organic character growth. That's not to say they do not grow. On the contrary, the growth feels contrived; decisions made simply to drive the narrative's conflict. There were a few instances where I asked, ""Why doesn't the character just do this?"" Or, ""Why didn't they do that?"" And, each time, the answer was, ""Because then the movie would be over.""In conclusion, I believe this is a great film. Although my rating is officially a 9 in my review, I would say the film is more an 8.5. It is a solid entry... But, with more polishing around its characters, their actions and motivations, the film could have been much improved. Regardless, it has enough going for it that any viewer can find something to enjoy. Overall, it is a stunning movie filled with cutting edge effects, great set pieces, costumes, action sequences, and a perfectly curated, often times bombastic, soundtrack. If you enjoy blockbusters and Marvel movies in general, you won't leave disappointed."
5," Beautiful movie bogged down by plot and pacing problems
",aweynand96,/user/ur25221924/,21 November 2022,"First off, this movie pops. I have to give kudos where it's due. Africa is a continent flush with color and they wove a tapestry from that rainbow, then doused all their costumes and sets with it. It's a gorgeous thing to look at, with suits that could have (and probably were) ripped right out of Marvel comic books, and sets of a science fiction dream. Visual excellence is laced with an exciting and memorable soundtrack, something other Marvel films lack, and more of the quality choreography we've come to expect. They don't innovate much in this last department, but it's what the audience was hoping for. As a backdrop for a theoretically fascinating conflict between two advanced civilizations, it overdelivers.But unfortunately, for me and my companions, these upsides really didn't make up for how long and inconsistent this film turned out to be. It runs a chunky 2 hours and 40 minutes but it doesn't fly by; many sections drag, and they drag loudly. You can feel it in the theater, when a character dives into an overlong speech that doesn't end up influencing the plot, or a filler montage stomps on the flow of the story. A teenager in my row fell asleep and his friends teased him for it. When the action picks back up again, your renewed interest is just a tad less than it was before the fluff.The plot itself plays pretty fast and loose with the elements that are supposed to support meaningful outcomes. An example is the magical blue plant, upon which the entire plot depends, that is given no real backstory, explanation, or contribution other than ""it's a magic plant"". Another is the suggestion that the US government was about to ""declare war on Wakanda"" based on conjecture (why on earth would they ever do this?), or the villain deciding to ""declare war on humanity"" (as in, yes, all of humanity) even though his empire is thriving by itself. Later, after a poorly planned attack on the villain's empire, the Black Panther resolves the conflict in a dull and uncreative way - it insists on weakly executed, last-second mercy. According to the writers, a bit of mercy is a sufficient motivator to forgive and forget atrocities they spent 90 minutes detailing.I don't want to imply that these actors underperformed, because they didn't. This is a great cast. I've seen most of the lead women in brilliant roles and they put work into these characters. Though to be honest, I'm not sure why Martin Freeman was in this movie, because he has nothing to do. Maybe it was for the fans.To end on a kind note - I did think they paid respectful homage to Chadwick. That man was a phenomenal actor and from what I understand, he made better everything and everyone around him. That part they nailed.5/10 for a visual buffet and fun characters."
1," boring movie without any plot
",rehan-2035,/user/ur23808294/,21 November 2022,I dont know who is approving these kind of movies/series. First she hulk and now this movie. It was more than 2 hrs with extremely bored content. I literally slept twice in the movie.Kevin needs to make up his mind and start screening scripts before its too late.Characters development were weak too. You dont have to stretched this much.Black Panther replacement should with someone more powerful and knows how to act. Shuri doesnt even know it.1/10 for Story!!!1/10 for Character Development!!!1/10 for Kevin (if he approved this movie)!!!1/10 for tried to cash Chadwick Boseman's Death!!!
9," Greif and War
",zachmasterzero,/user/ur40450330/,21 November 2022,"I found this film to have a tremendous amount of heart all the way through. Letitia Wright and Winston Duke delivered some fantastic performances among many and it felt like much of the cast were all determined to make this a film to remember.In many ways the new villain, while appropriate for our heroes, felt more like a subplot. This film did its best when it swayed away from the heavy effects and focused on the emotions of their actors.It is a shame this is coming out the same year as an Avatar film as their underwater shots featured some fantastic practical visuals that will feel underserviced or lower quality than if they had fully CG'd the film. That said it was nice to get into the utopian settings of two hidden kingdoms.I very much enjoyed this and look forward to repeat viewings."
7," Beautiful tribute with some missed opportunities
",judywalker2,/user/ur1062771/,21 November 2022,"Of course like everyone else I loved the original Black Panther and this film gives a great tribute to Chadwick and T'Challa. Shuri, Okoye, Nakia and Ramonda have wonderful storylines. I liked the introduction of Riri and look forward to her future. The costumes, sets and scenery were what we would expect from the great nation of Wakanda. The backstory for Namor and his people was brilliant and Talokan was beautiful.Saying that there were some things for me that could have been done better, the music was uninspiring. I wish there had been improvement in M'Baku's storyline and the lack of other important male characters was troubling for me as were some of the fight scenes that went on forever.I also had the same problem with this movie as I had with the original. The villain is really not a villain. Namor and Killmonger are opposites with the same goals and to see the Waukandans flight them wasn't pleasant. I do get the point, but I wish they had circled back to the real villian. But I guess that will happen in other movies."
6," Good not great.
",sizzlincv,/user/ur97815505/,21 November 2022,"More hyperbolic reviews for this than there was screen time for the titular character. It was brilliantly acted and poorly crafted at the same time. Truly some of the best acting that the MCU has to offer and a great job honoring the late Chadwick Boseman. That being said, RiRi Williams felt forced into this film so Disney can ensure their coffers are filled come her solo spin-off series. It doesn't come as a shock to me given the social awareness boondoggles Disney has produced in Phase 4 that they would choose one of Marvel's biggest comic flops to showcase in the name of ""righteous equality"". That's great on its face, the problem is, her story was never compelling to begin with. The Black Panther was an established Marvel character with an omnibus of great storytelling to his credit. The twenty minutes of screen time we were allowed to see The ""new"" Panther in was decent but I left feeling I deserved a better payoff after sitting for nearly 3 hours. Again, it was ok. Good not great, but that's not going to cut the mustard anymore after 20 years of terrific film making. The bar is too high now and most Marvel fans won't be lowering it anytime soon."
7," Still no connection with UCM
",joshy-40534,/user/ur103193553/,20 November 2022,"An ok movie, but my expectations were too high. Needed more connection with the entire UCM or hints for future projects. Too much Wakanda itself, I understand that this movie was going to be a Chadwick Boseman memoir, but it was more a Wakanda memorial. I thinks Black Panther is way better than Wakanda Forever, fortunately Namor appeared, without him and Talokanians this movie would've been a 5 out of 10. Let's hope Phase 5 of the UCM learn from Phase 4 mistakes and what fans want and deserve. For me let's put 1. Spider-Man NWH, 2. Shang-Chi, 3. Doctor Strange MOM, 4. Eternals, 5. Wakanda, 6. Black Widow and last the joke of Phase 4 Thor LAT."
1," Extremely disappointing
",chyngyzkalybek,/user/ur133104491/,20 November 2022,"We have reached a point at which people will watch anything that has the tag ""Marvel"" on it. I kept fighting to prevent myself from falling asleep during the first hour. It's incredibly slow and nothing interesting happens. Namor and Talokans could be terrifying but couldn't reach their full potential.The forced jokes weren't funny at all. The action sequences doesn't look good. The background tracks/scores were too much or had no control. It stood seperate from what's happening.Overall Black Panther Wakanda Forever pays a beautiful and emotional tribute to Chadwick but lacks heavily in a well written or engaging story."
8," An Emotional Ride, Marvel Did Its Finest!
",vishuarora-20785,/user/ur155935197/,20 November 2022,"Rest in peace Chadwick, I Hope Finds His Peace Up There.It will never same without the original black panther but nonetheless shuri did a remarkable job by taking over what Chadwick left.The Movie Was Slow, More story based as it was necessary to build up for the new black panther.Less Action and the character Namor, I find him quite interesting also loved to know that mutants will be coming back soon to the line up.The movie paid a good tribute to Chadwick.I think action could have been more there but never mind.. the movie was great and love to see shuri joining the avengers.I loved every bit of it as marvel is giving the movies like they used to in terms of Storyline , action but I think this movie to be a good marvel comeback.Everyone should watch this movie for Chadwick and for New Black Panther !"
7," Almost great, but bogged down by MCU setups and, I assume, Covid 19
",Cathbadhian,/user/ur45211431/,20 November 2022,"This obviously has a great movie at its heart, but the MCU recently has been very hit and miss. The movies aren't focused on a message or direction, and Disney+ is encouraging an orgy of hints, nods, and character setups. The MCU world seems to become ever more unreal and disconnected from reality as the plots grow and diverge.Wakanda Forever is bloated by all of the above. Ironheart is a needless diversion to avoid an origin movie, and setup a Disney+ show. Off tone, badly timed, and adds nothing to the movie. There are diversions to create more suited characters, again unnecessary. Another CIA scary person is set up for another movie probably. All pointless detours, eating up the minutes.This is really disappointing because the movie is good in spite of this. It could have been great if Marvel focused on making just this one movie."
7," Better than the first film but still nothing amazing
",danpearce-55075,/user/ur68473591/,20 November 2022,"I honestly don't know what the hype is with this film or the predecessor. The first was okay with a very basic predictable story with horrible CGI and this is a long bloat film with some horrible dialogue at times. The way they handle Bosemans passing was very good but the second act of this film was so slow and a drag. Plus the hypocrisy that the wakandans give is mind blowing plus for some reason the basic human for milaje are capable of deflecting bullets with their spears which is probably the most ridiculous thing in the film. Namor is a reasonably good ""villain"" his intensions are good but executed In a ridiculous way. Everything with riri willaims (ironheart) felt so awkward and show horened in just to set up her spin off series."
10," To the Legend & his Legacy! 42x23
",innovativengineer,/user/ur125930018/,20 November 2022,"What took me away is the Opposition the kuku' or whatever the correct name is. His character has been one of the best competitors in the MCU given his history.The movie is mostly engaging with the story and the plot. Each character has a part of their own for couple seconds fame and attention.I wished to see a little more of legend for his tribute to fill the character with so much passion that we root for him and will always will.One thing which was not right was the post credit
Although after iron man this is the only movie i guess without a post credit scene. Saving the best for last
The legacy is set to prosper."
6," Low expectations and not even that
",ferpego89,/user/ur28677285/,20 November 2022,"The movie contains a very weak story you can notice the lazy writing, too long, it became a little dull and boring.Main character un charismatic, poorly acting, predictable.Angela Bassett acting is superb, the best of the movie is her acting and she dies...
Namor made the effor and succeed, nevertheless, the story is not good enough.CGI is lame, looks like 90's power rangers, MCU needs to deliver a better product and actually justify those millions of dollars spend, it is a shame after so many great movies in past years.And also, we are going to get mini series of Iron heart??? (another one with no charisma) not watching that.SOLID 6."
10," A solid ten
",Gilmoregirl-59340,/user/ur99803873/,20 November 2022,"This movie, in my opinion, is the most well done marvel movie to date. I truly cannot fathom how anyone could walk out of the theater not having been emotionally moved. Everything is on point-writing, directing, and performances. It was beautifully done in every way. Do not miss the mid credit scene! It's an experience I wish I could re live all Over again For the first time-it absolutely took my breath away.I think there is a lot of thinly or not so thinly veiled racism in any negative review so please take that into consideration. This is coming from a white female in her thirties. Inclusion and diversity matters. Representation matters. This movie matters."
9," Isolate it from the MCU and it's amazing
",ramosmisael,/user/ur155175733/,20 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is the best from phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, despite being very different from the usual Marvel action-based genre.The story is compelling and emotional, as the main themes are family, tragedy and grief.Namor, the antagonist and villain is terrifying and has meaning to the story. He is not a sleeping villain, with no real motivation or stakes; he has a clear goal and knows why he is doing it. Shuri's character development is really good throughout the movie, and the side characters such as Okeye and Riri really add up to the story.The cinematography and directing of Wakanda Forever is amazing: breathtaking shots and good, tho short action scenes. Furthermore, the color palette and costumes are beautiful; and the score by Ludwig GÃ¶ransson is for me one of the best in the entire MCU.Overall, this movie is an amazing masterpiece if you isolate if from the MCU-genre.Black Panther: Wakanda forever is a meaningful, emotional and respectful tribute to Chadwick Boseman; must watch in theaters."
4," What did I just watch.
",yahya-87707,/user/ur159053181/,20 November 2022,This movie is is so dull. Literally waited 2 hours for something to happen. It has some real pacing issues just like the eternals and the wait leads to nothing. The climax is just underwhelming.But the pacing isnt even the worst past. The dialogue feels so out of place its not even funny.Dont know they decided to add a scuffed ironman girl. Whats the point of that. Dont tell me she is getting solo movies in the future.Whats even more funny is the suit for okeye. It even looks more scuffed.As a long time marvel fan its so sad to see them go downhill. The Movies keep becoming worse.Literally one of the worst marvel movies.
2," Excruciating
",jon-wilson-1,/user/ur10705372/,20 November 2022,One of the worst movies I've seen. About 90% of the movie consists of scenes with a couple of people in a room talking to each other. Insanely boring.There are a couple scenes that are ok but they are so short compared to the dialogue scenes. The part where they visit the underwater kingdom is great but it's brief and underdeveloped.I'm not exaggerating when I say that about 45 minutes of this movie consists of a few people taking in an underwater cave. The writer and director of this movie should retire immediately. I can't even imagine what would happen if a little kid went to see this. Expecting Marvel superhero action and instead seeing a half baked underwater equivalent of 12 Angry Men.
8," could be so much better
",MrHuunn,/user/ur58467764/,20 November 2022,"I don't think the script was very good in this movie. The western world's interest in colonialism and the king Nomar inspired by the historical figure mentioned in a Mesoamerican story are the good sides of the scenario. The actors were great. Some scenes were very emotional. Actress Letitia Michelle Wright was stunning. I wanted to hug him and cry. By the way The land of Tolakan could have been much more impressive in the movie. Chadwick Aaron Boseman, someone so special can never be forgotten. The work of screenwriters and directors is very difficult. I hope they will prepare new projects that will make us happy in future projects. I'm looking forward to it."
7," Wakanda forever? More like goes on forever
",ianajjames,/user/ur10772881/,20 November 2022,"Really wanted to enjoy this film and I did, but would have enjoyed it a lot more if at least 30 minutes had been shaved from the run time. Don't get me wrong the performances by all of the cast were great, the special effects were outstanding, but the film really dragged on at times.The touching way that the passing of Chadwick Boseman was handled was absolutely perfect and clearly meant the world to the cast.Setting up for future occurrences in the mcu seemed at times to take precedence over plot with the introduction of both ironheart and prince Namor (loved the casual use of the word MUTANT)But for the love of the cinema goers of the world think about the runtime!!!"
6," Wish I could give two ratings
",jdb351,/user/ur30856307/,20 November 2022,"I'd give it 8 stars for its presentation and handling of themes of grief and loss. When that was at the forefront, it was rather powerful. However, the rest of the movie was 4 stars at best. This contained some of Marvel's worst cgi, the new panther suit was almost as bad as the old green lantern suit in spots. The pacing was horribly disjointed, the action sequences and especially the final battle didn't even manage mediocre. The introduction of Ironheart felt forced. A film that was supposed to be an ode to Chadwick Boseman did not need to be a vehicle for introduction of a character that has her own series coming soon. All in all I rank this as one of the worst overall Marvel movies."
6," Different style of Marvel film
",gavinp9,/user/ur21319675/,20 November 2022,"'Wakanda Forever' was always going to have a tough job, needing to replace star Chadwick Boseman who passed away from cancer in 2020. Rather than try to do a 'Rise of Skywalker' and use some archive footage/CGI, Coogler chooses to have T'Challa killed off immediately. This sets the scene for a sombre outing, with Wakanda dealing with new challenges now they've shown the world their vibranium resources.It's good that T'Challa's mum, Ramonda (Bassett), gets more screentime, but sister Shuri (Wright) is the star here. Okoye (Gurira), Ayo (Kasumba), Aneka (Coel), M'Baku (Duke), Ross (Freeman) and Nakia (Nyong'o) are all back again, but it feels like a lot has happened in the four years since the first film - mostly because of 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame'. Namor (Huerta) is the villain in this film, and while he's similar to the comics character, here he's of Mayan descent, with the under-water kingdom seemingly in the Gulf of Mexico - called ""Talokan"", not Atlantis.Some of the decisions made by the characters and by the director don't make a lot of sense, with it sometime feeling like a lot has tied to be shoehorned in to make a film, rather than a linear storyline. Riri (Thorne)'s character seems pointless; Nakia is wasted until the end; and I'm not sure it needed to go for 2 hours 40min. It's by no means bad, with a solid ending, but doesn't really feel like a Marvel epic and probably has too much death and not enough fun. FYI, there's no end credits scene, just the one after the titles."
4," Very Average Film, A Wasted Effort All Round
",iansyard,/user/ur19413179/,20 November 2022,"Surprisingly unemotional film. Black Panther 2 without the Black Panther is Disney Marvel's biggest folly yet. Delay and recast were the way to go with this sequel. Way too long running time to sit through a plot so boring and incoherent. So focused on current day and forgot to put the brakes on the director and writers throwing everything up the wall and using what sticks. The Namor character was so far removed from the classic origins of the old Marvel comics, he just came across as the weakest antagonist in the MCU with a poor backstory. The Shuri character is less annoying in this one than she was in the 1st Black Panther film but nevertheless, unable to carry the weight of the film. Angela Bassett was ok as the Queen. A fantastic actress that was given a poor plot and reasoning to go against the wishes of Namor that sparked the tensions and war. The Dora Milaje female warriors were even more insufferable this time round than ever before, quite frankly on this evidence, they'd beat the old Avengers and Thanos in one afternoon the way the director has amped them up with nothing more than carry shields and extendable staffs. The worst character in the film - Riri Williams aka ""Ironheart"", the teenage 19-year-old genius from the age of 3 first built her own powered Iron suit??? In this film she yet another Disney heroine with a sulky bad attitude that knows everything, a well-used and tired Disney trope at this point. The two scenes dedicated to the late great star Chadwick Boseman were exploitive at best. Of course, I understand the cast and crew wishing to pay tribute to their former cast member, but what was served just didn't hit me in the feels the way the film wishes it did. Everyone has said it already, they should've recast the Black Panther role instead of replacing him. Now the franchise has ruined itself behind the glaring fact that T'Challa is no more, again a choice that just didn't work. A very poor and disappointing film. Black Panther 2 is a mess of a film that ultimately dishonours the late star."
3," Nothing In Name Of Story
",sagarsharma-33505,/user/ur121010352/,20 November 2022,"Marvel nowadays is churning out movies with basically no solid plot at all and Black Panther Wakanda Forever is just another addition to their mediocre work which can rather be great. I don't know which age group or what kind of public Marvel is attracting or is it that Marvel thinks that everybody are just die hard fan of their universe. At first it seem like some occasional dents but now it's too worrying. Still rooting for them to come back with a BANG otherwise DC seem to be coming to their wake at long last.At last, I think Marvel need to build their villians as well. We need someone like Thanos. And yes they have to stop destroying strong villians like Gor. That's the only way Marvel can do it."
3," What????
",dallorens426,/user/ur23003674/,20 November 2022,"This movie is so bad it's hard to focus my editorial! The first Black Panther movie had many problems and some very horrible scripting but this next movie is so bad that I don't know where to begin. I hope that this movie quietly sails off into the horizon and then falls off the edge of the earth. Don't waste precious time on this tripe! It's a shame Chad Bozeman passed away so young he was perhaps the only socially redeeming quality of the first movie. The clearly racist anti male anti family over tones are just disgusting. Is this the best we can hope for now from the Marvel universe, really? Run away from this one you will regret the lost time."

",crystaltcmrocks,/user/ur159030209/,20 November 2022,"This movie gives a sad yet amazing acting end to phase 4 of the marvel franchise. I loved this movie and the acting was amazing. I balled my eyes out during the final scene due to the emotions Shuri was experiencing and the song. Okoye proved yet again how sassy she was and how she still is my favorite character besides the king himself. R. I. P. I wish I could've met Chadwick, but seeing him act will have to do. A lot of people were there, so a lot of people wanted to watch the second movie. Chadwick was an amazing actor and I hope that whoever is next will be just as great. Overall an awesome movie and would definitely watch again."

",taimalisahuda,/user/ur133824090/,20 November 2022,"I really liked the movie. But It's time for marvel to get serious with their villains . Namor didn't do anything according to his plans . But the story line is good . Again Marvel is working with great cultures of this world . The suits and dressings were pretty good and convincing. But the color of talokan wasn't that great , and it's very eye catchy. I really loved Shuri and Riris character here . Lastly I loved the way how Marvel showed it's moral that don't let vengeance consume us . Angella basset did a very good job playing Queen Ramonda'd character . Lupita's part was small but she played it very convincingly . Overall the movie was great."
8," Another Way of Water
",thesar-2,/user/ur17825945/,20 November 2022,"Sorry, James Cameron. BP beat you to the punch.WOW, talk about Redemption. As much as I missed the incredible Chadwick Boseman in the title role, this sequel is 10x the movie the first one was. The first Black Panther solo project was good and had incredible performances all around, but the story was so vastly meh and unoriginal. While the story wasn't perfect in BP2, it was much more compelling and engaging.NO SPOILER, but since Chadwick Boseman died in real-life, his iconic Black Panther character, aka T'Challa of Wakanda, also died. The movie deals with his loss and the vulnerable and scattered kingdom he left behind. In comes a previously unknown underwater kingdom to pose a threat to both Wakanda and the remaining population of Earth. Will a hero rise from the ashes of T'Challa?I hate all trailers. They spoil way too much, usually on purpose. The only time I see them, is when I'm practically held hostage before a movie theatre experience and even then, I rarely pay attention or look away. At anything else. Especially for movies I want to see. I wasn't at all excited to see BP2, so I didn't mind seeing the trailer and WOW. That had to be the most depressing trailer I've ever seen. Sure, Chadwick died and that was tragic, but when I see a Superhero trailer, I prefer to be amazed and in awe...not left miserable. Mercifully, the trailer is just the beginning of the feature presentation and they do move on swiftly. (Though, they still manage to spoil some great scenes.)I was grateful for that. The movie, while playing really hard with the passing of the king, did move on and into the story of the aftermath. And while no discredit to Chadwick, he did have an enormous amount of charisma in the original and stole every scene he was in. BP2 REALLY allowed all the other great actors from Part 1 to shine. And Bright.Especially Letitia Wright as Shuri and the ALWAYS MAGNIFICENT Angela Bassett as the Queen. That's not to say there weren't other great performances, including the ""antagonist,"" Tenoch Huerta as Namor, also known as the Sub-Mariner. (Helps he was gorgeous and shirtless the whole time, but that's neither here nor there.)I even loved how separated this movie was from the MCU. The references to other MCU movies were minimal at best and this was VASTLY welcomed. If I have to hear about Thanos and his snap one more time...I digress. This movie looked great and even though it was super long, for the most part, it wasn't felt. I will say I did have a huge problem with the editing and scene transitions - of which there were none. Scenes just abruptly stopped and we're suddenly somewhere else which led me to think ""Oh, I guess we're here now."" That and how the last half wasn't anywhere as good as the first half made me rate this movie not too high, but high enough to show I really did enjoy myself from beginning to end.The MCU has NOT been hitting the same homeruns since before Endgame, but it does have its charms. Spider-Man: No Way Home is my personal 2nd favorite MCU movie and I did even enjoy Thor: Love & Thunder (#9) and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (#10.) But, the rest of the post-endgame films, excluding this one, are mediocre at best.I'm proud to admit, of all MCU movies so far, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is now the 8th best. Not bad for a 30-deep mega-series.***Final Thoughts: THANK GOD this handled Chadwick's real death as part of the storyline here. Not to mention gracefully and respectfully. One of the biggest problems I had with both the Fast & Furious and Star Wars franchises was how they treated their major stars' real-life deaths. They DIDN'T. How they're writing out/around the character of Brian (played by the late Paul Walker) is absolutely ridiculous and disrespectful. (The CGI-Walker was creepy af, to boot.) And the late Carrie Fisher's Leia had a fantastic out for her onscreen death, but instead they made her into a cartoon, gave her a soap opera coma and wrongfully and cartoonishly kept her story going until they finally did conclude her saga. (The CGI-Fisher was creepy af, to boot.) BP2 finally did the right thing...even without the crappy CGI."
6," Not Much to Like About This One
",sflanagan-47676,/user/ur98513419/,20 November 2022,"After waiting just over a week from release to watch this, I hadn't seen or read any previews or spoilers and I really have to say that I was disappointed in the film.The underwater scenes were terrible, the action was subpar, sometimes confusing and the humor was simply sad. The movie drug on feeling every bit of its 2.5hrs length, not always, but sometimes felt like a political statement.I liked the first Black Panther movie and miss seeing Chadwick reprise his role like everyone else, but we really need two separate instances of paying homage to him in the film?The only bright spots of the film for me was seeing Shuri assume the mantle of the panther and M'baku take a step forward on the character development front.My advice would be to wait for this one to come out on Disney+."
6," Should Have Been a Series
",kgprophet,/user/ur1158617/,20 November 2022,"There is a huge amount story to tell in this very large scope world of Wakanda. Lots of characters with lots of goals to obtain. All the major characters are quite emotionally driven I must say. With so much to accomplish, the audience has a lot to digest in one long sitting. This type of ensemble setting with kingdoms and leaders and betrayals works better as a ""Game of Thrones"" type of series. It would also give the audience more time to appreciate the production design and costumes. The appealing look of the film helped to give the character performances more impact. The story rightly avoids being about the missing main character, the now deceased Black Panther. His absence draws the movie's attention to the supporting characters, and they are given a lot to do.The large story justifies the long running time, sure. But the storylines could have been given more attention to the audiences' benefit. So good filmmaking all around. Angela Bassett commands the screen in Chad Boseman's place with great success. As usual there are big action scenes with lots of CGI. They are perfunctory as usual."

8," GREAT story, NOT SO GREAT characters
",djohnchoi,/user/ur159024685/,20 November 2022,"Black Panther 2 starts out with moaning of original Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Wakanda missing a leader in this movie.Without any spoilers, movie does really good job honoring Chadwick Boseman throughout the movie. We're constantly reminded of the role of Black Panther and why Wakanda needs a new leader / a new black panther.In order to fill the original Black Panthers (Chadwick Boseman)'s shoes, the movie brought in Shuri as the new leader/Black Panther. Even though we UNDERSTAND why Shuri could be new Black Panther, her character development is just not there. Shuri is placed on the challenges in order for her to grow into a heroine, but she DOESN'T develop into it. Shuri is placed to the challenges but she doesn't overcome it herself. She is forced to accept, just like the viewers.We all know the new Phase is coming, but we need to be attached to the new heroes/heroines. The movie just puts a new young heroine and tells us to accept her as a new Black Panther. Just like the Iron Heart.The movie has a great PLOT and a fantastic villain (Namor). We UNDERSTAND Namor's reasoning and his actions. With Shuri and Iron heart, they are placed there to just fill in the old shoes (Black Panther and Iron Man).Overall, it's a fun Marvel movie. I enjoyed it.The antagonist, the new phase, the new Characters.It's exciting.But I wonder, if they'll ever fit into the original Black Panther and Iron Man?"
8," Well Done............
",owenpont-70803,/user/ur143796475/,20 November 2022,"I liked this film quite a bit. From beginning to end I felt the heart that went through this film. There is so much love that is shown and makes the film emotional throughout. The action was very well done throughout. The acting was also quite solid. I think the one thing is that the film does somewhat drag. Some scenes I felt weren't super necessary to the plot as well. I did like Ironheart though, although she could've been left out of the film and it wouldn't have mattered, she was still cool. They do need to explain some stuff about Ironheart though. Overall I thought this was a nice, bitter sweet, action packed film that was quite good. It was by far the best thing Marvel has put out this year."
10," Channel my grieve
",jobambang,/user/ur149421244/,20 November 2022,"The movie give perfect balance between superhero genre and drama. Good action sequence and natural plot story. Bring Namor and his nation Talocan based on ancient Central America culture with Mexican casts is so amazing and brilliantly avoid similarity with DC counterparts Aquaman. The detail and background story of Talocan culture born in the age of conquistador is so uncanny. I also have a doubt when Tenoch Huerta portray Namor in the official trailer. But it turn out he give superb presentation as Namor, a bitter leader driven by the fate of his nation ravages by invader.In the end, i praise and want to say thank you to Ryan Coogler for this fantastic and amazing film presentation. As audience and MCU fans, the film allow me to channel my grieve and condolences for our beloved actor Chadwick Boseman."
6," Fell asleep
",RebelPanda,/user/ur58930232/,20 November 2022,"RIP Chadwick Boseman. If Wakanda Forever gets anything right it is being respectful to the late great actor. From the intro Marvel title sequence montage of his greatest moments, to the commemoration at the end. They treated his legacy with care and consideration, and especially no CGI resurrections (cough *Star Wars reboots*).About an hour of the film is setup and retcons, which is when I fell asleep. The second act is primarily character development and world building, primarily led by the amazingly talented Angela Basset. Unfortunately, Queen Ramonda doesn't get as much screen time as the much less interesting Shuri, played by Letitia Wright. Wright is a fine actor, but as a protagonist Shuri doesn't have nearly enough depth to carry a whole film. Her struggle involves revenge and grief, generic conflicts even reused from the prior film.Shuri's character arc feels very redundant by the end, but hey, at least the CGI was awesome. The last third is almost all flashy greenscreen action scenes, directed well enough. Just don't go into it expecting memorable set-pieces, unique characters, or a revolutionary story. IF you want that, rewatch the original film and treat this as a feature length tribute."
3," Not worth seeing in the cinema
",ccqfcdpyx,/user/ur123344330/,20 November 2022,"I loved the first one, but I saw this tonight and it was quite disappointing. The way they used the actor that played Black Panther previously was at first touching, but dragged the whole movie down for me and it became quite joyless especially after they pointlessly killed off Angela Basset who had the best lines and performance in the movie. You feel like they were milking it.I personally think they should have recast Black Panther and moved on rather than 90% of the movie not having Black Panther in it, and her showing up at the very last battle scene thanks to some yawn worthy McGuffin. Either that or just not have made another Black Panther movie.The suit for Iron Heart was so bad, it looks like a concept drawing cross between a power ranger and a transformer. Awful.Some of the motivations of Namor and the plot points felt very contrived in all honesty and I didn't really like the Sub Mariner's depiction here, because it's a whole other character.This felt like a relatively low budget movie. It didn't really have the scale and scope you would hope for, the final battle on the weird ship with the completely flat top without any hand rails to stop people falling overboard was disappointing, and Shuri's fight with Namor was dull and over quickly. She gets stabbed through the stomach with a spear (no blood at all), but pulls it out and gets right back to fighting...and it's never really mentioned again, which is just dumb.We're introduced to cartoonishly evil white Americans, with plots that didn't really go anywhere. Like this paragraph. The other issue with Black Panther as a property is that Disney approaches each movie relatively separately. If Shang Chi felt like ""Disney does China"" the Black Panther movies are ""Disney does Afro-Futurism"" and some of it feels like stretch to be taking place in the present day or indeed the rest of the MCU.Some bits reminded me of the lion king (""Remember who you are"") and overall, I didn't feel like it moved the MCU forward, it sort of left them with another conundrum of whether this now continues with Shuri as the Black Panther for diminishing returns or it just gets put out to pasture on Disney+."
1," Just gutted at this movie.
",mheapy,/user/ur39091400/,19 November 2022,"The King is dead , Long live the .....
Oops maybe not it's another big miss again for MarvelI will start by saying I absolutely loved the first movie, Loved it , it 100% stood out amongst a sea of films of this genre and with Chadwick Boseman leading the Wakandan people along with Michael B Jordan & great support cast they all just nailed it in every respect , however with the devastatingly sad early passing of Boseman who's career was about to explode after blossoming well for the last decade I feared for the worse & after watching it this afternoon coming after a long delay my fears were realised as it doesn't compare or come close in any way to the first film, I don't wish to drop spoilers but the very premise of the first movie which is the strongest person leading the Wakandans which was arguably both in body and mind , this was completely chucked in the bin for the benefit of lazy crap writing and inclusivity , the old saying of trying to fit square pegs in round holes suits perfectly , I've scored it a 5/10 but I'm all honestly had the content involving Boseman not been in this movie invoking the feeling of loss & contemplating what could have or maybe should have been had we not lost him this film would probably have only pinched a 2/10 from me... I don't wish to drop spoilers but this movie was everything I didn't want it to be ,
I will leave it like this
MARVEL WAKE THE HELL UP NOW !The current standard of the films is shocking once you take the gloss off the productions aside from Spider-Man & parts of Thor every film since End Game has been horse muck."

When they finally start losing enough money hopefully they'll focus on what's important not what is trending. Trends come and go, they'll watch it irregardless of the characters choice of personal life.All the movies and some of the shows have all had this problem and it just brings the whole movie down. I watch and just wait to see when and who it will be. This movie waited near the end to unnecessarily spring this on us and just wasn't necessary.Overall the movie was really good, the usual excellent special effects and great story.

8," Wakanda Forever takes characters on personal Journeys of Perseverance.... with depth & Poignancy.
",Ed-from-HI,/user/ur49279086/,19 November 2022,"Before seeing Wakanda Forever, it seemed like an impossible task to match the success of the first Black Panther film from 2018....... how could anyone adequately fill Chadwick Boseman's shoes or ever revitalize and re-energize the Black Panther legend? Some viewers probably went into theaters this time with some skepticism but Ryan Coogler (director and co-writer) generated a small miracle going in different, unexpected directions. The acting Team including Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, Danai Gurira, Lupita Nyong'o all brought genuinely heartfelt performances containing extra dimensions of poignancy that took the audience to emotionally resonant realms rarely seen in Marvel films (or any big-budget action movies for that matter). I was really surprised by the intensity of authentic emotions throughout... each character was forced to overcome nearly insurmountable grief and adversity in order to step-up and transform thru shear perseverance to fulfil a unique personal journey.And the addition of 'Namor' Tenoch Huerta as primary adversary seemed like a genuine stroke of genius! Namor (aka Sub-Mariner) of the original comics (one of Marvel's very first created characters in 1939) was always rebellious, short-tempered, arrogant.... but also a masterful tactician creating 'expedient' tenuous alliances sometimes with heroes (like the Fantastic Four) but also villains like Doctor Doom, always believing that Land-dwellers could never be trusted and would eventually bring calamity & destruction to his underwater Utopia. The original Marvel comics featuring Sub-Mariner were always interesting but 'Wakanda Forever' again seemed to bring added dimensions to Namor with even more complex motivations and a point-of -view that audiences could at least partially sympathize with (Namor's origin scene harkening back to 1500's when conquistadors bring disease & destruction, ravaging a peaceful Mayan village, was brief but indelibly chilling). The Best and most interesting adversaries in films & stories are never pure mindless 'villains' but those who have a complex moral code that traverses the spectrum of good & evil and are unpredictable in dispensing mercy and retribution.Overall, I really liked Wakanda Forever but it was not what I was expecting.... the vibe is much different than the original Black Panther (and other heroic endeavors) with scenes that run the gamut of meditative, intense, heartfelt, conflicted, reflective & revealing but always with an undercurrent of poignancy.... ensuring that Wakanda's Legend is certainly secure and deserves to live on thru the far-future."

",dndpat-94938,/user/ur107952451/,19 November 2022,"It's called Wakanda Forever, because that's how long it takes for the film to finally end. Somewhere in these scenes is a pretty good movie. But slow, choppy pacing, along with way too boring expositions make this movie almost painful. Did we really need to know all of Namor's back story? His birth scene? Iron Heart story got too little screen time with any real constructive gravities. The Target ad they showed on TV was more constructive to the character and her motives. Too many excesses made this a poor outing for Marvel.I'd like to see. More of Namor, Black Panther and Wakanda. I'd also like to see a good version of all the above."

",mklarsen-51895,/user/ur74848679/,19 November 2022,"I only went to this with my son because Black Adam was sold out... while it was cook they introduced IronHeart, the movie lacked the excitement and punch the original did. There are a few moments worth laughing at, the ""Ball headed demon"" part for example, but overall it was relatively lackluster. The winged feet don't quite make sense either since everyone drank the same potion but only Namor has them and doesn't age.... It's okay as a middle movie to set up others but as a standalone movie it wouldn't be worth the effort. I saw nothing worth being excited about.If you're looking for something to watch in between good Marvel movies then it's okay but I regret paying to see it."
6," Overall, weak
",Chanandler-Bong,/user/ur22963396/,19 November 2022,"This film had some great stuff in it, there's no doubt of that, but I felt it was overall weak. I can't imagine how hard it was for everyone in the film to come back without a lead, and most importantly, their friend. Chadwick's passing is unbelievably sad but it did leave a gap for Marcel to fill, and they could have done it so well. But they didn't.Firstly, the good. All the emotional scenes were well-scripted and well-acted, and I have to commend Angela Bassett and Letita Wright for their fantastic acting. I never cry in the cinema but this film really had me going because it felt from the heart in some scenes, and I am sure it was.I also enjoyed the costumes - wow were they beautiful. The only one I didn't like was the Midnight Angels (or whatever they were called). They didn't feel like they fit. Some of the fighting was great as per.The rest of the film felt slow, boring almost. I've just come from the cinema and I am struggling to remember much of it.The story was gaping with holes and so much was skipped over with little explanation. The beginning when T'Challa dies felt cold and rushed. That should have been the pivotal moment for the story, but it was brushed over. However, maybe it was too hard for the cast and crew to linger on.The Talokan/Atlantis story was odd to me and felt so disconnected from Wakanda. I didn't enjoy that storyline. They could have made it so much better.Anyway, it was enjoyable and I'll maybe watch it again. But I won't rush to do that."
7," A Little Bloated
",xiaoli7377,/user/ur123364108/,19 November 2022,"If they had trimmed the run time down just about twenty minutes, ""Wakanda Forever"" would have been much better, in my opinion. It's been a while since I had seen the first ""Black Panther"", and I must admit that I didn't have the opportunity to rewatch the film before seeing it's sequel. So maybe a little bit of getting lost in some of the plot intricacies is on me. Some superfluous dialogue moments that didn't necessarily need to be there. Some pacing issues that could have been cleaned up just a bit.The main female cast was excellent. I loved seeing all of the recurring characters. They handled the posthumous celebration of Chadwick Boseman in a discreet and respectful manner that didn't come off as overstated or eat away too much at the film standing out on its own two legs without the support of its former lead actor.I definitely felt that it was nowhere near as good as what I remember the first one being. The main villain here, Namor (Tenoch Huerta), is not nearly as strong as Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger. That being said, it is much better than the majority of the mediocre endeavors that Marvel has put out in the post ""Endgame"" era of Phase Four. If you were a fan of the original I think you will be pleased with a lot of what this movie has to offer, but I also think you will be let down in a few other aspects. A good movie nonetheless that I recommend checking out if you get the chance."
7," Great story fantastic tribute, but pacing is an issue
",comedy_claire2001,/user/ur1320540/,19 November 2022,"As a film which aims to honour Chadwick Boseman's legacy it ticks all of the boxes. This is a story of grief, vengeance and forgiveness - with wonderful performances from its strong female cast. However, pacing is a real issue, and the film drags unnecessarily. Every time there is a build up to what should be a typical MCU action scene the mood shifts downwards with misplaced and superfluous dialogue. I've been to see this film twice already to see if the pacing really was an issue, or whether my expectations were too high - but I've concluded that Act III really is a chore to get through..It was always going to be a difficult story to tell, but I think if some of the scenes were rearranged and dialogue cut to really build up to the climax of the film we'd be seeing one of the absolute best films in the MCU."

This is another dud and I'm extremely disappointed. The score was good and some scenes were okay but overall, this is a cash grab. 1/10.If you're still interested in watching this movie, I would recommend you save your money and wait until it is out on a streaming service. Do not waste your time and money on a drawn out drivel of a movie with no story and character development instead, this is cashing out on the success of the previous film's success. Shameful."

",petefavuzzi,/user/ur112407047/,19 November 2022,"This movie consist of two good things honoring Chadwick Boseman and action scenes. Other than that I think the story writing was not the best and it left me thinking wow they missed a perfect opportunity in many many scenes especially the scene where there is a fight on the bridge and killing the side character would have of drawn you in and would've brought more motive for vengeance for the main character but sadly many missed opportunities story writing. The acting is still good, just weak writing and I think they just know marvel fans are coming and don't care anymore. Hope things change for the better because seeing a boat sink is not fun when you grew up with it."
8," Brings Some of the Magic Back.
",ryanpersaud-59415,/user/ur65683941/,19 November 2022,"The Good: So, it's no secret that Marvel's Phase 4 has been...less than stellar and clearly not as beloved as previous phases of the MCU. The films have mostly been lackluster, the TV shows even worse, and there seems to be little creative direction of cohesiveness.I'm happy to say Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is definitely the best Phase 4 MCU film, and it's not even close. This is coming from someone who felt the original Black Panther was an unremarkable film with an awesome (but under utilized) villain, but one that had undeniable cultural power and impact. Wakanda Forever, to me, stands on its own as a legitimately great movie.Chadwick Boseman's untimely passing is handled very tastefully here. It's not a plot point but an overarching theme that hangs over the movie. Grief, and how we process it, is the underlying emotional engine behind Wakanda Forever, and it's wonderful. This movie - thankfully - eschews the typical, ""joke a minute"" tone of most MCU movies for something more mature and melancholic. When there is humour, it feels appropriate.Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, Lupita Nyong'o, and Dania Guerrera are really, really good in this movie. It's amazing how all of these women give such powerhouse performances, and I love how well written their characters are. They aren't emotionally dead robots, as many MCU female protagonists tend to be. Wright is a fantastic protagonist, and her character Shuri really comes into her own. This is a small detail, but I like how she really acts her age; she's brilliant, but she doesn't know everything. She's still volatile and angry. Her, and everyone else here, are really well written and feel like actual human beings.That brings me to, in my opinion, the strongest aspect of WF: Namor. As a huge comic book nerd, I always give movies props when they can take a character most consider kind of silly and make him/her cool. Namor - complete with goofy ankle wings - is legitimately awesome. He's a powerful, intimidating, yet emphatic villain with a lot of depth. The Talokan (the people he leads) not only act as an amazing parallel to Wakanda...but they're just COOL.From the way they look, to the set design of Talokan, to their weapons and powers - is amazing. I love the use of the Mayan language, their entire aesthetic, their blue skin, the breathing apparatuses they wear...basically everything about Namor and the Talokan slaps.They're the first MCU villains since Thanos where the feel like an immediate threat to the protagonists as soon as they're on screen. We understand exactly how powerful they are, early on, and it's rare for a movie like this to establish that yeah, the antagonist(s) are clearly more powerful than the protagonists, and victory isn't guaranteed.As a film itself, WF is absolutely GORGEOUS. Easily, its the best looking, best shot, and edited MCU film in years. The shots have such depth and emotion, there's so much colour, and the scenery is often gorgeous. The music is fantastic as well; I like how it changes from Spanish/Mayan to Afrobeats depending on where we are in the movie. The editing is also great, with nice use of slow mo to highlight key action set pieces.Toss on a very tight script where everything clicks together really well, and you got yourself one hell of a movie.The Bad: RiRi Williams. Absolutely, if there's one aspect of this movie I think needed to be excised completely, it's her. Her story feels the most tacked on and unnecessary, and I'm sorry, she's no where near the charisma or charm of a Robert Downey Jr. I also felt her character - yet another black woman - to be a bit superfluous in a movie where 4 of the main characters are also, well, strong black women.There's a weird subtext as a non-black person watching Wakanda Forever that the Wakandans, outside of their obligations and affection for other black people, don't really care for the rest of humanity. This could've been eliminated completely if the ""scientist"" was, I don't know, someone of a different race? Shuri could've connected with him (shocking, I know) or her on a personal level, and communicate the idea that Wakanda too has something to learn about the rest of the world. I don't know, it was a missed opportunity.I feel like whenever the film leaves the central storyline, it gets significantly worse. This is a long movie and it really didn't need to be. The scenes in the United States do nothing for the plot and actively raise questions that film doesn't even acknowledge: how is Wakanda still so far ahead of the rest of humanity, even after we've been in contact with aliens, magic, and have Stark tech, for at least. A decade and a half at this point?If the rest of the world actually felt like a threat, it would give the film a nice secondary conflict and go to explain why Namor feels so threatened. (Also, the line about ""what would America do if we had vibranium"" really irked me. The US was the only country with nuclear capabilities for nearly a decade, and they showed restraint. Come on now)The Ugly: Despite some flaws with the narrative, Wakanda Forever is definitely the best of the Phase 4 MCU films, and I'm excited to see where the series goes. I like the idea of Black Panther being that franchise more grounded in humanity; with characters and nations inspired by the real world."
5," boring and way too long
",lucas-marius,/user/ur107522102/,19 November 2022,"The initial conditions for this film were very difficult. Actually, he just wanted to tell a new Black Panther story. But instead, he now has to deal with the death of Chadwick Boseman and introduce a new Black Panther. On top of that, he has to introduce the character Riri Williams to prepare for the new ""Iron heart"" series. You can clearly see that the film is constructed around all these aspects and the actual plot suffers from the various aspects. If you have seen the trailer and know the context of the film, the viewer actually already knows everything that happens in the film. That's why the film feels way too long, it's completely predictable and there is never any suspense."
8," Fitting Tribute to a Legend
",UMirxa12,/user/ur29323060/,19 November 2022,"Wakanda Forever does perfectly what it needed to do above everything else: it pays tribute to Chadwick Boseman in heartfelt, respectful, and worthy manner. Ryan Coogler, his team, and the movie's cast have pulled it off admirably, and fortunately without any silly MCU jokes (of which I had been afraid since I watched the travesty that was Thor: Love and Thunder).The movie is a welcome return to form by Marvel after, I'll say it again, the horror show which was Thor: Love and Thunder (easily the MCU's worst offering since The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2).It has its lighter moments where necessary but nowhere are comedy and humour overdone, and for the most part, the movie hits all the right notes. The direction, acting, cinematography, and writing are all excellent, and the film score is absolutely breathtaking.Letitia Wright (Shuri) and Danai Gurira (Okoye) are exceptional here, and supported brilliantly by Angela Bassett (Queen Ramonda), Lupita Nyong'o (Nakia), and Winston Duke (M'Baku).Tenoch Huerta's debut as Namor is exquisite in its portrayal, and the folks over at DC should take notes on how to properly and effectively portray an underwater kingdom and its super-powered king.(I spent most of the movie wishing we could have had the joy of watching Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa share the screen with Huerta. It would have made for some legendary scenes).Dominique Thorn's debut as Riri, I felt, fell slightly short of the mark, and she might perhaps have been better introduced in a movie which did not have so much else going on. Still, I look forward to seeing more of her in Iron Heart and other MCU projects.Martin Freeman's Everett Ross, Julia Louis-Dreyfus' Val, and Michaela Coel's Aneka are little more than footnotes here but they do set up some interesting ideas for future MCU projects, including 'The Thunderbolts'."
10," Can't understand the hate
",atrysh,/user/ur91449996/,19 November 2022,"What people fail to notice here is that they had a different story in mind before Chadwick's death, and had to rewrite most of the stuff because everything was different now. The way this was handled by Coogler is a very commendable task and you could feel how tough of a challenge it was to deliver such a heartfelt tribute to T'Challa and Boseman. I absolutely loved it, though the story could have been a little better. Compared to the stuff marvel has been releasing as of late, this was a huge improvement in every department.Amazing, heartfelt, exciting, and nothing short of a spectacle.And yes, the soundtrack in itself was so lovely that a few departments could've been bad and I still would've had 0 complaints! All hail Ludwig."
4," Subpar Sequel an Assault on the Senses
",looking_Work,/user/ur25846153/,19 November 2022,"Overcoming Chadwick Boseman's death is a high hurdle to overcome and Coogler/Marvel were tripped up by it. Having Black Panther die off screen was bad enough. The way in which they did it compounded the error. To have Ramonda just walk in and say he's dead was anti-climatic. Then, later in the movie, Shuri is talking to ca-cul-whatever and she says that T'Challa suffered with an illness and did not tell her until it was too late for her to do anything about it (Does that not mirror Boseman's real life situation).The dialogue at times, many times, seemed as if it were written by a teehager or a child. When Shuri tells M'Baku that Wakanda was going after Nah-muur because it is what she wanted, as the only adult in the room he should have told her that since she was now the queen her actions should reflect what her subjects need, NOT what she wants. Her actions are like those of Joe Biden, who apparently thinks he is our ruler.Finally, there is the 3rd act. Who, in their right mind, would fight an enemy in an environment where the enemy has the advantage?!? Lure the 'Atlanteans' to land and THEN FIGHT THEM! Shuri should be impeached, via ritual combat (whatever happened to that being the way succession is determined?). She caused the deaths of hundreds of Wakandans by fighting in the ocean. Did you see how many of them there were at the beginning and then note how few were left at the end?As I write this I am realizing that I need to drop this from 5 stars to 4."
5," An overly long missed opportunity
",jiri-chard,/user/ur9335676/,19 November 2022,"The opening 30 minutes were good - natural grief, darkness and action. Then for some reason the movie just dials down the darkness and the action, and adds lots of unnecessary characters and musical interludes. It meant the battle scenes were just dull rather than epic, and sometimes I thought it was watching an advert for a perfume or iPhone. Even when you thought a twist had been introduced they didn't follow-up or something implausible turns it round. Perhaps it had something to do with the lack of a main character until late in the film. Anyway, at least 45 minutes could be cut and you'd have a standard watchable Marvel movie. The end credits aren't worth hanging around for either."
5," Not sure what all the hype is about
",srfsmgqwt,/user/ur142430400/,19 November 2022,"5/10Several friends of mine went to see this movie before I had a chance to. I was unsure how good it would be, but they reassured me it was amazing. I was relieved (because I did not think it would be that good honestly) and went to see it by myself. I ended up being greatly disappointed.This movie is mediocre at best, with roughly 2/3 of the runtime taken up by dialogue. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't need a Michael Bay ""explosion every minute and a half"" in order to be interested in a movie. But this second installment of Black Panther was just plain boring to me. A well-done, well-casted, well-scripted movie? Sure. The plot was simply lackluster in my opinion. There is one medium-sized reveal at the very end that (almost) makes it worth watching, but honestly, I could tell you the entire movie's plot in 10 seconds or less. There were too many main characters and a very forgettable ""bad guy"", which made for a very meh movie.I'm hoping whatever the next Marvel installment is more attention-grabbing than Black Panther: Wakanda Forever."
8," Emotional..
",shaikhirshad-41223,/user/ur99503134/,19 November 2022,"Director Ryan Coogler takes you on an emotional ride with black panther 2 story. Movie starts with a beautiful tribute of T'Challa aka Chadwick Boseman. And from the start itself you'll emotionally attached with the film. The pace of the movie is slow as compare to other marvel movies but still you can watch further for the engaging climax. Visuals are outstanding the way director has shown WAKANDA as well as TALOKAN is watch worthy. Well as NAMOR stands namor is one of the coolest villains in the MCU. But his story doesn't excite much as it should be though it has great ability to stay in the MCU for long-term but let's see where he goes after this film. Acting & Cast are the soul of this movie. Specially Shuru, Queen Ramonda & Okoye just nailed their roles in every scene of this film. Movie goes from start to end on a serious and emotional mode. There is alosyone character that I like to talk is RIRI WILLIAMS her performance also does justice to the character but she doesn't have much to do and the lack of the story. Drawback of this movie is it's STORYLINE & PACE. Otherwise you can easily give a try for Visualls, Actioy & the emotional connect with the character BLACK PANTHER..."

",rjhill33,/user/ur9341453/,19 November 2022,"Marvel has lost its way here. It's like watching a rip off of other marvel movies ( Iron Man, Aquaman + the new avatar movie that isn't even out yet). I swear they copied scenes from the new Avatar trailers! Boring, inconsistent, lacking direction...The best, and only good moments were the tributes made to Bozeman at the beginning and end...including the mid credits additional reel.There are a few moments when you think it may find its own way, but they are fleeting at best. I think they just posted this out for the obvious revenue that will come from the first wave of movie goers.Wait for this one on cable. Very disappointing."
6," After Thoughts
",freethinkingworld,/user/ur139689817/,19 November 2022,"I feel like my emotional anticipation for this film may have been the reason I was so disappointed in after leaving the theater. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad movie and I don't want to sour anyone's opinion in watching it. But like with almodt everything in phase 4, temper, temper, temper your expectations. The movie at times can pay beautiful homages to Chadwick Boseman, and then in other times it builds you up and as a viewer and lover of the Marvel films, you feel like it would be a perfect time for another touching moment to reflect on Boseman's legacy, and it will totally drop the ball. And then on top of all that, the story for this feel has to be one of the weakest (except for Thor: Love & Thunder). I feel like Marvel studios thinks that if they put in enough jokes and enough comic references that we will look over lazy writing. But they are wrong! And I am deeply upset that showed that in this film most of all. Letitia Wright was amazing as ever in this film and carried it a lot. But there is only so much she can do. Not the worst in phase 4 but a very apparent drop from what Marvel used to be."
2," Profits Forever
",arunsarm,/user/ur26182311/,19 November 2022,"Terrible pointless movie made to milk the tremendous success of the first film.Nothing hits home, not the story, not the emotion, not the villain, not even the premise. Most of the relationships and banter seem forced. Special mention for an insipid villain. Completely lacking screen presence, especially compared to his Merman counterpart from the DC universe.There are a couple of showreels for the wonderful Mr Boseman who passed into the ages but it's easy to see that this pathetic waste of film is less an ode to Wakanda Forever and more a lesson on ruthlessly following profits.A half done, half baked 3 hour waste of time."
1," Most boring Marvel movie yet
",matthewjgould,/user/ur127572783/,19 November 2022,Barely any action and the whole movie felt like a 3 hour Oscar memorial. At least an hour too long with only 3 real action sequences. New Black Panther is not inspiring or even likeable. Comes across as a whinny child. Kept checking my watch while waiting for anything to happen. Namur and his cohorts are not menacing at all. Their design makes them look like a teaser for the sequel to Avatar. New outfits for Okoye looks like a rip off of the Predator except in blue. Doesn't advance the MCU at all. Latest in a recent bunch of poor MCU movies. I long for the good first 10 years of the MCU. Bring back the original six.
8," I Really Did Not Want To Like This But....
",unclekdog,/user/ur45575504/,19 November 2022,"Since the first preview, when I seen how they portrayed Namor, I was like ""Hell No!"" However, being the major Marvel Comics fan that I am, I watched it like I do all of the other movies. I have to say that I was quite surprised. The writing was top notch, the acting was way better than it has been in the past few releases, and the effects were great. I even grew to endure the liberties they took with Namor and thought they made it work with their story. I had been getting disappointed in everything after Endgame, but I would have to say that Wakanda Forever gives me hope for what is to come. You might be surprised as well!"
6," Forcing too much on emotions, weak vilain, Riri very dislikeable
",mrn-aglic,/user/ur51353462/,19 November 2022,"Going into the movie with no expectations, I gave it a 6/10. Why? Well... its a nice and welcoming thing to mourn the loss of a beloved actor and friend. But the whole movie doesn't move from the point of trying to make you sad at any point during its long run.Furthermore, I found the vilain dislikable... and Riri plain iritaiting... the girl of 19 re-creating the cire of Iron Man's tehnology in a garage? Give me a break.Also, I'm all up for strong female heroes (looking at you Ahsoka), but you don't have to make all of the males practically useless.The entire movie whining remindend me of Star Wars episode 9 and its very badky backfiring atempt to force nostalgia on to the viewers."
8," Surprising and Powerful
",mikedud-81751,/user/ur157810725/,18 November 2022,"I was not such a huge fan of the first Black Panther film. Though culturally impactful, the film did not resonate with me as much as others. Black Panther: Wakanda Forvever does, as it explores the themes of grief, lose and acceptance very well.The film had an almost impossible task, filling the shoes of the late Chadwick Boseman. His presence is dearly missed in the film, but it is expressed by each of the characters partaking in it. Leita Wrights character Shuri, takes the mantle not only as the titular character, but as the heart and soul of this movie. Her character was very fundamental throughout the whole film. Her development from quirky tech savvy teen to an emotionally complex and layered leader is very well done.The main villain of the film Namor The Sub Mariner, is a big standout character. A very powerful sympathetic leader, who is trying to protect his hidden nation from the impending threat of the outside world. Many parallels are drawn between his kingdom and Wakanda, along with his character and Shuri's.My only real gripe with this film is how they over saturate the side characters with unnecessary subplots and upgrades. The runtime would have been shorter if not for the focus put in on elements that did not add much to the story.Overall Wakanda Forever is a great tribute to T'Challa/Chadwick Boseman, great storytelling and much better action sequences then the first film. Ryan Coogler really made this movie standout on its own compared to other MCU projects."
6," Solid with a Couple Reckless Mistakes
",Grahamerwhamer,/user/ur99874372/,18 November 2022,"I enjoyed it overallThere were scenes that weren't out of place, they were just a bad and made it feel more like a student film at times.I'll list the worst I can remember:The enemy never references losing half of their population.I thought the enemy couldn't die but later they die without an explanation.The cheesy as heck shell symboling they did.The logic behind why they would fight Wakanda was weak.Not enough backstory on the main enemies that weren't the ""God serpent.""How the Wakandan spy got past the enemies defenses.Wakandan's can perfectly separate an inifinity stone from a sentient robot but can't save someone who just dies from too much water in their lungs?The arm wrestling that decided who was dominant?The visual design of the wakandan ""iron men"" was ridiculous looking.Then figuring out ""his source is the water!"" Was random and based on nothing. The people want a story and a backstory, give it to them.There was no long term ""saving"" of our cia Frodo- friend. It was just an escape.This is this only thing that could be considered ""political:"" Also, when the general said ""now I see the colonizer in chains..."" that was a bit much. I recognize horrors that England has done in the past. I don't think the current ""white man"" -unbeknownst of his heritage at that- should be held responsible. That is identity politics and group guilt. Let's just say historically that hasn't worked out well.At the end when the kid said ""I guess.""I think they should have developed the Wakandan general and the spy more. Also, I think they should have given the black pantha to the spy."
10," An intimate yet Epic story about Loss
",tadavies-15568,/user/ur149993617/,18 November 2022,"Wakanda forever is not only the peak of Marvel's phase four (which I didn't expect considering the triumph of no way home) but also (in my humble opinion) one of the best marvel films to date.With the tragic loss of Chadwick Boseman, it was difficult to decide what to do with not only the Black Panther franchise but also the character. Personally, I'm so glad they didn't decide to recast T'Challa, not only because I feel that would be disrespectful but also because we wouldn't have received this touching tale about grief and how to mourn.The plot follows Queen Ramonda and Shuri following the death of King T'Challa and I must say this Angela Bassett and Latita Wright are the strongest actors within this film, delivering well on the action as well as the flurry of emotional beats within the film.A year after T'challa's passing, the pair go to a secluded area in Wakanda where they meet our antagonist for the plot, Namor.Namor is a really good parallel to Shuri in this film, having succumbed to the anger in the loss of his mother, causing him to lead a life completely separate from the surface in Talokan. From here, the action ensues with Namor wanting to kill Riri Williams for accidentally making a vibranium finder.While this is certainly an emotional film, this doesn't mean there is a lack of action. In particular, Namor's attack on Wakanda which looked visually stunning. I believed that the first Black Panther film was one of the greatest looking Marvel films in terms of production and this one somehow looks even better, potentially the best throughout the franchise.The score for this film also adds to it, some highlights being ""No woman no cry"" and ""lift me up,""There is always a sense of melancholy running throughout, even from the silent opening credits with images of Boseman to Ramonda's reaction of Shuri's kidnap to Shuri taking on the mantle of Black Panther and carrying on her brother's legacy.The climax to this Epic is also a standout for not being an over-the-top CGI mess with world-ending stakes, but rather a small area with the two warring nations battling it out and Shuri against Namor in the desert. The final decision not to kill Namor was powerful, with her being able to overcome her grief and act like her brother despite the hardships.It wasn't until the final moments I was completely crying with Shuri sat on the sand, finally ready to move on with her life, carrying her brother with her, ending with ""Lift me up"" to close the ending.Overall, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is one of the best marvel films with a touching story about loss and not succumbing to your grief. 10/10."
4," A superhero movie where they forgot to include the superhero
",sbweightman,/user/ur93138442/,18 November 2022,"A superhero movie where they forgot to include the superhero and when they finally do bring one in, they bring in three at once. The tribute to Boseman is effectively moving and the story is good and quite mature, but there's nowhere near enough action and it feels like a hodge-podge of lots of other things. The film is slow, long and dull; the action is bland and lacking, the American CIA scenes were completely unnecessary and although there are some visual spectacles in the grand scale, it's never that spectacular. The villain was good, the characters are ok and the tribal elements are colourful, but it just didn't excite, thrill or amaze me the way a superhero movie should."
7," Should Have Been Called WAKANDA MOURNS
",bankofmarquis,/user/ur10919398/,18 November 2022,"The passing of Chadwick Boseman from cancer is a unfortunate and sad thing. The makers of the Black Panther series of films for the MCU had a difficult task to accomplish. How do they pay tribute to their lost lead while also leading the series in a new direction? In the end, they ultimately decided to lean INTO (and not away from) his passing - and your emotional involvement in this film will be predicated on how you react to this, for basing an entire SuperHero Movie on grief and longing for a return to the past is not going to make the ""feel good movie of the year"".Directed and Written (with Joe Robert Cole) by Ryan Coogler (he of the first BLACK PANTHER film), BLACK PANTHER:WAKANDA FOREVER starts on a somber note with the off-screen passing of King T'Chala and the grief and celebration of life for him by his Sister Suri (Letitia Wright) and Mother Queen Ramonda (Angela Basset), both of whom are reprising their roles from previous MCU outings. This is all well and good and Basset, especially, shines in these early parts of the film for she is one of the best actresses working today and she rises above the material (and, if I'm honest, the other actors on the screen) to show actual grief and sorrow on the screen. Some are calling for her to be nominated for an Oscar for this role and she would be a deserved recipient of this.With that out of the way, it's time for this film to move on to it's current adventure and the emergence of a new Black Panther. But, Coogler doesn't do that, he hangs onto the grief, anger and sorrow that is being felt and this mood permeates the entire film - to, ultimately, it's detriment.Newcomer (at least to the MCU) Tenoch Huerta (THE FOREVER PURGE) shows up as Namor, the Sub-Mariner, the villain of the piece and he is formidable enough but with the lack of a Black Panther to battle him, it doesn't seem like a fair fight. Suri, Okoye (Danai Gurira), M'Baku (Winston Duke) and the Dora Milaje (with Florence Kasumba and Michaela Coel being at the forefront - and they are terrific) all are game at the battles and trying to make it to the forefront. But this Wakandan group needed something.They needed Chadwick Boseman.While Angela Bassett was the star power the film needed in the first half of the film, Lupita Nyong'o filled that bill in the 2nd half and it was comforting to see her - and her character, Nakia - back in the MCU.Unfortunately, the character that didn't really gel was the catalyst to the conflict, Riri Williams (and her MCU SuperHero alter-ego Ironheart) played by Dominique Thorne. This character felt tacked onto this story and her Superhero origins were not really explained, so one will just need to ""go with me here"" on this one.Because their is no real emotional center to the battles, they felt like CGI forces fighting CGI forces and the underwater scenery was ""fine"" but nothing special.As stated earlier, this film has a dour, mourning mood to it throughout, making it feel more like a morose DC film than a life-affirming, fun MCU film. So just be prepared for that.BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER should have been titled BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA MOURNS and it would have been a more accurate title.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
6," should have called with film Fishman
",blackmelo,/user/ur68470887/,18 November 2022,"We all know Marvel has lots of money to spend and considering this is a 2 1/2 hour film I was expecting a good show but I was a little disappointed. At the time of writing this, this film has a higher rating than black adam which I just cannot understand. Black adam was funny and entertaining. This film has no humor whatsoever which is a shame. So it loses points for that. For the money that was clearly spent on this film I was disappointed. The first half of the film is introducing us to army 1. We already know wakanda which is army 2. Both talk in alien languages throughout most of the film and it is hard to follow the story as a result. I feel it would have made more sense if this was played out on a completely foreign alien planet which I just pretended it was most of the film. A lot of gibberish and there is a bit of action but nothing as entertaining as black adam provided. Why does army 2 invade army 1? I don't know. Maybe this was mentioned in the gibberish that I could not understand through half the film but whatever the reason, it was just a fake reason over a fake element called.vibranium. Nothing I could really relate to. I should really give this film a lower score but there was a lot of good flying spaceships... Anyway the enemies leader called Fishman was just a complete joke, and not in a funny way. It's a flying fish man like spider man who has pigeon wings to make him fly. Like what? Check it out and you will see what I mean. He has pigeon wings to make him fly. It's hilariously stupid. So I cannot relate to why this film has such a high rating at the time of writing this review. I have liked wakanda films so far but this one was just a let down. Wakanda has been portrayed as pretty much invincible, in charge of vibranium and the most advanced technology on this planet so what could marvel do to enhance their story? Not much to be honest but this just felt like an embarrassment. So yes they create a new invading army that feels the need to invade wakanda for what reason, I still don't know. Half way through the film once the fighting actually starts I thought, ok this must be the reason for the high rating but after a 5 minute fight that leads to nothing much there is then a lot of gibberish talking again, a big outrage, a bit more talking, a bit more talking, followed by more talking. What happens to fish man? Who knows - the talking is more important at this point and fish man loses his screen time. We are now approaching the end of the film and there is still more drama, over what? Not really sure. If you are a fan of tv soap drama's this might be right up your alley but if you like action films avoid this travesty. There is 5 minutes of action at about the 90 minute mark of the film that fizzles out into nothing but drama. The wakanda council convenes to plot a plan. The final battle takes place resulting in a big water sports spectable. Nothing you would expect from a 21st century marvel fim. Maybe one of those low budget horror films where a bunch of tourists get attacked by a giant shark. You know the type of film I mean. Anyway that pretty much concludes the film and my less than impressed review. Clearly others have enjoyed this more than me. The ending actually gets worse than I have revealed in my review but I will not give away marvels glorious final twist too much. Lets's just say for a fake battle the ending was the most pathetic ending I have seen in a film in the past decade along the lines of peace is more important than war. I mean I agree with that message but this was meant to be an action film, not a lame drama."

",killinglimits,/user/ur158968551/,18 November 2022,"I liked the other Black Panther's and was hoping for more from this one...If you're into 3 hours of funeral's, drumming, some slow motion action, and a script ripped out of a WhatsApp group chat between a fairly normal family then this is a film for you but I felt like a Cheech and Chong movie has more action. I get it! It wasn't easy... R. I. P. Chadwick but if you have nothing decent to release why bother losing fans over a space filler. I would much rather a title get cancelled and then after a long wait something awesome comes out. Instead you wasted 3 hours of my time and lost a fan while doing so. Pick it up Marvel!"
3," Generic trash.
",Krugerharn,/user/ur23412584/,18 November 2022,"The first Black Panther did well because it was over hyped and in reality was a very generic film with a nonsensical story.Wakanda forever manages to take it to the next level and make one of the worst MCU films to date.Terrible acting, story and effects makes it very forgettable. The worst/funniest part of the movie is that they make a 2 stone girl with zero combat training Black Panther. The best part is when she takes a spear to the spine but can keep on fighting and actually beats Namor, a warrior with generations of combat experience. Ha ha ha ha ha..I also found it funny how they knew she could never beat anyone in unpowered single combat so they had to shoehorn in M'Baku at the end to try and cover this but it made zero sense.One of the most generic, boring MCU film to
to date."

",Kevin-42,/user/ur0076091/,18 November 2022,"Sorry, but this was boring. Mind-numbing boring. Sleep-inducing boring. ""Are we there,yet?""-boring.Dang, I liked Mr. Bozeman and they pay some propper respect to his character in the first couple of minutes and it really hits you in the feels but after that we are let known that Wakanda have mastered the technology of exposition dialogue. If that is their main achievement then I say we forget vibranium and let them slink back behind their stealth shield and call it a day.They could have done so much with this movie and show Africa as a vibrant place full of ideas and hope in the face of many problems. Maybe explore Ubuntu philosophy, or visual art. Unfortunately, Wakandan culture is reduced to a song&dance number for the day-trip tourists in cinema seats.This was a missed opportunity and almost a missed movie if not for a good double espresso I had before it."
9," Beautiful Big Screen Adventure
",leoalexanderscott,/user/ur103456469/,18 November 2022,"I can imagine Marvel hardcore comic fans may be a little upset with the changes to the villian Namor, from ruler of New Atlantis to the King of Aztec decendants of the Talokans who had retreated to sea eventually creating a secret underwater civilisation who have access to one of the vibranium deposits on Earth. But Wakanda Forever was always going to deliver significant change with a new Black Panther. I think all these alterations are perfectly fine and provides a stepping stone for a bigger Marvel story to unfold as cinematic franchise. The plot is decent and mature dialogue, and back by very good diversity of old and new characters twine into each others lives. Its a visual and emotionally beautiful journey from start to end."
4," Bad sound quality
",jpewther,/user/ur1159276/,18 November 2022,"I saw the 3D version of this movie at a local AMC Theater. The 3D and special effects were nice, throughout the movie. But for almost all the voices, there was too much emphasis on mid-bass, plus a bit of echo, making it difficult for me to understand what was being said. I don't know whether this was the fault of the sound track in the movie, or the particular theater where I watched it. But when there was background music, that seemed to be pretty much normal. So my message to all movie producers and theaters is this: just try to make human voices sound normal and understandable, and forget about trying to manipulate human voices in some way to make them sound more impressive or exciting--it ain't gonna work. I was falling asleep during this movie because I couldn't fully understand what the actors were saying, in their giant, bass-heavy voices."
6," Continues the downhill MCU phase-4 trend.
",nishant_raina,/user/ur155623705/,18 November 2022,"Breakdown as follows:Positives: (a) Movie paid a wholesome tribute to Chadwick Boseman directly as well as indirectly by not recasting his role. (b) Namor was pretty good, and his character well-developed.Negatives: (a) Dull visuals, especially the underwater scenes. (b) Ironheart is yet another superfluous, uninteresting and unnecessary character introduced by Marvel who suddenly after ""America's"" character in Doctor Strange 2 (although arguable much worse). What's with making characters so important so suddenly? (c) Killmonger in the Shuri's ancestral plane? Nonsensical to say the least. (d) Martin Freeman's character way underutilized with there being no need whatsoever to bring in his wife's character.All in all, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever suffers from the same problems as most other films in the MCU phase-4, namely, a weak story, over-ambition, incoherence, and lack of nuance."
8," Doesn't disappoint
",atreidies,/user/ur135391071/,18 November 2022,"Yes it's a little disjointed, but some known characters do show some depth and duality which can keep the viewer interested. But others seem out of place and unnatural. And still it successfully continues the story without having to rely on the multiverse. Which I'm so happy they didn't! Definitely safe for the kids and enjoyable for all. The effects are captivating and the story intersting. 95% of the acting is both believable and fit well into the marvel universe while paying respect to boseman.

",candicejgarrett,/user/ur112163819/,18 November 2022,"Black panther 2 was SO MUCH better than the first!! With the first black panther movie I was left wanting more, feeling almost like half the movie was cut out or something, but this one was absolutely spot on from start to finish. Angela Bassett and Leticia had incredibly strong and tear jerking performances. I simply cannot understand why anyone would be upset with this movie. The fight scenes were intense, and definitely kept you on the edge of you seat. If you come to the movies wanting to hate this movie, open you're mind, release the pressure of ""it HAS to be better than the first!!"" and just simply enjoy it. Must see!"

",stagist,/user/ur60876047/,18 November 2022,"I can't believe how many people are hating on this movie! It looks like too many people went in expecting the joke and testosterone-filled typical Marvel movie, to then overlook a great story and excellent new characters to embrace.Without giving anything away, the tributes throughout the movie to Boseman and his character, both on-screen and off, were perfect. His fellow actors' loss and raw emotion was transparent in the aforementioned scenes. The Black Panther legacy has direction and purpose even after the devastating loss of their intended future.The introduction of Namor and his people was brilliantly done. Slow build intro, to an immersive look into the land and people, to epic fight scenes with a ton of beautiful sequences. Coogler is 2 for 2 on creating a believable, strong antagonist who has a legitimized reason for being mad.I don't mean to spoil or add anything else really. Just go see it for yourself and appreciate the movie for what it is. An overall great movie that is much more than just another Marvel addition. Great way to end Phase 4."

I had a lot of hopes for this movie but I knew it wasn't going to be as good as the first one (of course) without Chadwick, but this movie was missing so much.The plot was incredibly slow and I personally think they took the wrong angle completely. I was incredibly disinterested for that hour long scene underwater (or at least that's what it felt like), that there was no coming back from that.I've never wanted to reach for my phone in a Marvel movie before this one. No rewatch value for me. But I will give credit where it's due for the amazing wardrobe, soundtrack and to the beautiful tribute in the opening and the credits."

I also enjoyed how Suri came into her own, despite all the loss, she did not turn evil as her cousin wanted but in the end, she listened to her mother. I think the message in this scene was, even at your worse, don't forget who you are and never give up on you. I also loved how they shared clips of Chadwick as the King and Black Panther. I cried at this part and earlier in the movie.All the actors were wonderful, even the new ones. There was so much talent in this movie.All in all, it was a wonderful movie! Stay tuned for Jr."

4," Boring
",bernie-23016,/user/ur130343951/,17 November 2022,"This film is at least an hour too long and feels every moment of it. Namor has been changed so much I don't know how they had the nerve to even call him that name. Calling the white people ""colonizer"" is particularly unsavoury.None of the Wakandans are very sympathetic, in fact they are all downright arrogant and rude, and extremely bad-tempered throughout. I nearly started rooting for the Talocans by the end.Marvel continue to fumble phase 4, where the emphasis seems to be on quantity rather than quality in every project so far. The only one I've actually enjoyed is Werewolf By NightJust very poor."
5," MCU inexorable descent
",qvxhkkp,/user/ur158933795/,17 November 2022,"The film is unnecessarily long. Almost 3 hours where the characters are not developed and result just flat.Lazy script, not aided by the direction, which is also pretty dull. Action scenes result confused. There are also some dark scenes where you can't really distinguish what was going on.Some music appears to be random and clashes with what's going on one the screen, which is weird for a MCU movie. Except for the final scene, that one does the job.Acting is also not so convincing, except for the characters of Namor and Ramona.The tribute to the memory of the late Chadwick Boseman works pretty well. It is touching."

I ended up nodding off and she woke me up before the end asking to leave. I made her stay and at least she got a bit of enjoyment out of the last ten minutes or so. We'll probably watch it again at home at some point in the future, maybe a second watch will keep my interest.All in all it was disappointing, maybe I was expecting too much?"
7," T'Challa's Legacy
",alekspredator87,/user/ur52780913/,17 November 2022,"The notorious fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has already managed to acquire a bunch of unflattering reviews. A lot of projects that affect a lot of heroes, the lack of a clear narrative line, which the previous three phases of the franchise were famous for, just a huge number of second-rate and uninteresting heroes and an impressive number of inconsistencies - all this is imputed to the creators, led by the chief executive Kevin Feige from a loving and not very viewer. And against this background, the last film of the phase comes out, which should translate the Cinematic Universe into a new fifth. The name of the project is ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"".Frankly speaking, I was impressed with the trailer, hoping that the epic shown in it would move into the picture itself. And I wasn't disappointed. The scale of the film is present. There are a lot of beautiful scenes and locations in the picture. However, with all the danger indicated, which threatens a huge war between many countries, the film feels like it remains somehow local or something. Despite the potential conflict between continents and the ocean, I never managed to feel all the power that other projects with a large number of superheroes possessed.The visual component turned out to be cool. The picture, as before, pleases the eye. Marvel knows how to make his worlds convincing. However, I didn't really like the implementation of the Black Panther itself. The artists obviously messed up with her. The level of graphics and detail is clearly not up to the level of a Marvel blockbuster. The very first films even then looked much more realistic in terms of painted superhero armor. On the other hand, the even more open world of high-tech Wakanda and the new underwater world is very impressive. I pay tribute to the creators. They are able to surprise with detailed fantastic equipment, weapons, smart devices, equipment of heroes. Well, the countries themselves look great on the screen. These are whole new worlds that, it seems, could well exist in reality. However, you catch yourself thinking that the further the development of the Cinematic Universe moves, the more fantastic the worlds become, already noticeably different from the real one in which we live. If the first films still tried to somehow fit into the existing laws of physics, then the latest projects hit concrete fiction, where excessive loads on the human body at high altitudes and during deep dives can no longer do much harm to a person.There are a lot of heroes in the picture. The screenwriters quite successfully intertwine their destinies, thereby subordinating their characters to the events taking place. And these events lead to a global war. However, only residents of Wakanda, a small handful of people and residents of the underwater world will have to figure it out. Although the conflict will be spectacular, it will still be perceived as something not so essential, as if sterile, existing outside the general Marvel universe.The actors cope with the tasks. I would have noted the performance of Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett and Tenoch Huerta. Their brothers-in-law, Ramonda and Namor, respectively, were good and convincing. But here the whole point, as I think, is in the script, which devotes much more time to these characters, leaving everyone else in the background. The events unfolding reveal the motivation of the main male character of the picture. Namor is quite convincing in his monologues. He has seen a lot, so he makes preventive decisions to protect his world. Shuri will have to figure out how to treat the new realities that Namor puts her in front of.Another important point of the picture is Shuri's search for herself. After the death of her brother, she does not find a place for herself, and subsequent events make her lose faith altogether. In order to get together and accept everything that is happening, she will need to go through a series of tests inside herself, where unexpected meetings are waiting for her.The new heroine, Riri Williams, who according to the comics was a follower of Iron Man Tony Stark, seems to have been introduced here simply because it had to be done at least in some project. This character turned out to be of little interest to me personally. And it didn't work out to reveal it to the viewer. There were also problems with the balance of power between the rivals. If at first the antagonists appear as something very dangerous and inflexible, then, as if overnight, then everything abruptly turns over, extolling the opponents' strength. It doesn't look very convincing, but we have to accept that in an already protracted 2.5-hour film it was necessary to somehow approach the finale.The picture and the creators say goodbye in the film to both the hero T'Challa and the 43-year-old actor Chadwick Bozeman who left us. These are essentially two goodbyes. And if the first one passes (for me personally) without emotion, then the second such farewell turns out to be in place. Actress Letitia Wright, as if for everyone, from the film crew to the ordinary viewer, fills the frame with drama, with her tears she says how everyone grieves for Bozeman who left us. Touching.""Wakanda Forever"" turned out to be a good movie. This is a controversial project in many ways, which I personally quite liked. Not a bad picture with a lot of good jokes, by the way. Marvel again successfully manages to insert humor into its projects, thereby diluting a seemingly serious scenario. The picture will find both its supporters and haters. Someone will see the notorious agenda, someone good humor, someone beautiful visual, and someone illogical scenario. An amateur painting.7 out of 10."
6," Underwhelming, But OK
",slightlymad22,/user/ur4465293/,17 November 2022,"I just got out of Black PantherI found it pretty underwhelming. It's a better put together movie than both Thor: Love & Thunder and Doctor Strange & The Multiverse of Madness, and there is no sense it was butchered in the editing room, like both of those movies. That said I probably had more fun with those two.The Chadwick Bosman stuff was touching, but I expected more. Disappointed not to see at least, Bucky there. When I heard there was a cameo, I expected it to be someone at the funeral. I DID NOT see that cameo coming. I thought the Marvel logo was a nice touch.Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett are both good, but I'm not sure where this Oscar nomination talk is coming from. Then again, I didn't think Black Panther should have got a nomination for Best Picture, so she could get one. Winston Duke was a bit wasted as Umkaku, disappointed by what he did at the endThere is no reason for it to be as long as it is. I was bored a few times. I was especially bored during the story between Martin Freeman and Julia Drefuss, it was really weak and unnecessary. Was it just there to put some white people in it? I didn't like the scientist girl, she irritated me and had awful dialogue. Some of the CGI/Green screen work was not the best, too.I can safely say, with the exception of Spider-Man: No Way Home, nothing from Phase 4 will be rewatched, never mind find its way into my collection.Overall I found it OK."

",mmazzoni-46693,/user/ur158931411/,17 November 2022,"The acting was incredible. In all likelihood there will be awards for several of the actors. The music during the Black Panther reveal was badass and the soundtrack appropriate throughout. Great movie and much better than the more recent Marvel films such as Thor and Dr. Strange. This movie doesn't turn away from the reality of loss, grief, and how to hope. Strong female leads carry the entire film. Excellent movie and on bar if not better than the first one as we get more background on the supporting cast. They get the right mix of paying tribute but also center it around a story about the future of Wakanda."
4," Death of C.Boseman, subsequent downfall of BP.
",znhvwkgj,/user/ur156007909/,17 November 2022,"Over abundance of characters, thin and pointless interactions.Theme steals from DC and other Marvel content. Couldn't the story line have worth in a more authentic villain. DCs Aquaman will surely be getting a bolster already to viewing hype after the back end of this wash.Instead of a tribute, it's just rushed content. The whole left by Chadwick is well, it's not a tribute, it's a bit of slap in the face from his portrayal.Lack of actual Black Panther screen time was terrible and then the final scenes, were just to forced to a an inevitable conclusion.Save your money and wait for it to be available on a subscription service, as it will be there very soon."

It will literally bring tears in your eyes. It's hard to see a movie or a man who is no more but story is about him , on the name of his character which he played brilliantly. A big thanks to MARVEL . Also they handle this situation very carefully. Apart from that , other characters like shuri ,okoye , shuri's mother , namor and riri William did well ... Not about others but i really liked them apart from iron hearts suit which was no upto my expectations. The action scenes were good but the end fight was not heart touching to remember for years like Black panther 1 or endgame or infinity war. At the end the ending was too emotional for a Marvel fan who followed them even from just 5-6 years. They can relate their emotions with this movie . This movie is best of MCU Phase 4 after No Way Home ."
7," Not the Black Panther we were promised
",bendjowen,/user/ur69711517/,17 November 2022,"The movie is fine overall but it's so very long.The story takes ages to go anywhere but the scenes move way too quickly into the next ones.Namor was a great villain with a really interesting change and served to be the highlight of the film but it wasn't quite enough to save it and keep me invested.It did feel at times like a beautiful goodbye to Chadwick Bozeman but it often seemed to forget that it's a movie too.It also never really answers why the FBI are after Riri Williams (Iron Heart) they just show up and it kind of felt like they just wanted more involvement for Martin Freeman and Julia Louis Dreyfus than any practical, story telling reasons.All-in-all, better than the Disney+ projects but not the film we needed to save the MCU."

",drnasar-54208,/user/ur157567706/,17 November 2022,"I would usually rather not write a review even if i dont like a movie but this one has really got on my freaking nerves. Well i was expecting some adventurous, high pace, action movie but it was just ; extremely boring, unnecessary long scenes, dull, extremely lenghthy, maybe just 20 - 30 minutes of some action scenes in the whole 3hrs long movie, it was a serious struggle not to fall asleep almost the whole time. I cannot understand how the people rate it so high.My recommendation would be to rather wait for the DVD release if you really want to watch it and try to watch it but dont waste your time and money in Cinema, a big regret for me. I wish i could rate zero or in minus. P. s. I had loved Black Panther and i do love Marvel movies. That would be my honest review which can be very subjective."
8," Solid and heartfelt 8/10
",krazekw-216-943407,/user/ur58008510/,17 November 2022,"Pros:
1)The musical score is stunning, very profound and really adds and complements the nuanced acting in the film between vengeance and forgiveness.2)The acting is solid. Angela Basset gives an Oscar winning performance as the grieving Queen mother, mother and ruler of Wakanda. Leticia Wright is also a solid actor, stepping into a much larger role due to the unexpected death of Chadwick Boseman.3)The theme, as I mentioned before is the subtle interplay between vengeance and forgiveness built around loss and grief. While this has become commonplace in Batman, Superman, even the X men franchises, seeing it with Wakanda Forever just feels more mature, more fully developed characters that you actually care about.4) Ryan Coogler really stepped up to the job. He wrote the entire script with Chadwick in mind, when he died (RIP) Ryan had to re-write the script in a very short about of time.Cons:
1)The film is 2 hours and 45 mins, which is really 30 mins too long. Much of it was taking up by having far too many disjointed characters.2) This brings me to RiRi Williams character as Ironheart, I found her role and acting really annoying, it was clear the producers had overwhelming control over Ryan Coogler about how the story should be developed in order to set characters up for spin offs.3) Lastly, the underwater scene was too dark, and because of that you don't get to appreciate Nemor's world as much as Wakanda's even though we are meant to believe Talocan's world has the same technological advantage as Wakanda...seems unrealistic.Conclusion: The cons should not take away from how solid the film is, the acting, musical score and themes are great."
3," Mr. Bean's first 3D camera
",childsey01,/user/ur40051567/,17 November 2022,"I love 3D films. When done well they give a natural immersion and make the experience more engaging. When done poorly you feel like an idiot who's paid to watch someones home movies.Depth perception can come from a number of cues. Parallax is the primary one that stereoscopic movies aim to achieve. Other cues can be given in 2D movies such as perspective, focus, shadow and texture.The videography of Wakanda Forever unfortunately used a camera with a very limited depth of field (likely to make heavy use of focus as a cue for depth). A short depth of field does not work with a stereoscopic film. When I watch a 3D movie, I want to be able to have my eyes freely roam the scene for visuals in both the near and far fields. In order to do this a long depth of field is necessary. The non-action scenes in Wakanda Forever felt like a constant battle between the stereographic videographers telling me to relax and enjoy and look around and the 2D videographers going ""Hey I can be 3D too, if you just look where I tell you.""
It was a technical debacle and I really wish someone could have explained things to the producer so that it didn't end up being a conflict between pet projects.Oh and I think it wasn't too bad a movie apart from that, but may have been too distracted too tell."
1," It was hard to stay awake
",sensej-pl,/user/ur33179405/,17 November 2022,"I did watch it day after watching Black Adam and the difference was staggering. I was struggling to stay awake during this movie. So boring, full of feelings which are childish and story which resembles overcooked noodle. I was considering to leave theatre because I was so disinterested in the story and acting. The whole plot introduces bunch of coincidences and tries to go deep into feelings of characters we don't care about. Trying to ride the previous movie which was not the best but had a story and was in the range of OK. This one however,seriously one of the worst movies I saw in past few years. Save yourself time and skip this one."
6," A kingdom (and a movie) lost without its leader
",curlymst3000,/user/ur41309146/,17 November 2022,"Chadwick Boseman's death was so sad and sudden, and I still shed a tear when thinking about it, especially as he embodied a character, King T'Challa: The Black Panther, that meant so much to so many. Marvel and director Ryan Coogler made the prudent decision not to recast him in order to honor his memory and legacy. Rest in power, King.In the immediacy of tragedy, removing T'Challa as a character made sense. Unfortunately, one can't help but feel when watching Wakanda Forever that the lack of his presence brought not just the titular kingdom into turmoil, but the movie itself as well. A mistake by the powers-that-be in the long run. This movie is a rudderless ship that no one in the cast is strong enough to anchor. Disjointed, multiple storylines and characters that seem extraneous and unnecessary (Agent Ross with Director de Fontaine and and Riri/Ironheart in particular) stretch the movie into an unwarranted runtime. The central conflict between Wakanda and Namor's (Tenoch Huerta is far and away the most compelling and charismatic part of the movie, but doesn't get enough screentime--typical of the MCU's antagonists lately) forces is undercooked and lost amidst the mismatched ideas of how to carry the story forward.Ultimately, it befalls Shuri to assume the mantle of Black Panther, but frankly Letitia Wright is not a enough performer to do so, and her arc is rather odd and disingenuous leading to the moment that trailers spoiled months ago."
4," Ruined Wakanda, and maybe the MCU
",hewie-94361,/user/ur83346226/,17 November 2022,"Long gaps between jumbled action sequences, and still the film is overstuffed. Exponential growth of the franchise, mandating the inclusion of more and more characters, stretches the connective emotional tissue too thin, to the point that every other beat is a ""wait...what?""Chadwick would have wanted us to recast his character if doing so would have avoided this mad scramble, which puts his successor in the suit a film too early. We made Chadwick's passing into more of a burden than we needed to by making a movie about it. And they tried to sell us our grief, which felt... kind of predatory?The corporate rot of the franchise is starting to nauseate...LGBTQ+ representation? We love it if it's honest but...doing so in a stand-alone scene for domestic audiences, which gets cut for international releases? Vomitous, and abusive of the community."
9," So good
",cococola4444,/user/ur40150751/,17 November 2022,"I cried twice. They did this sequel AND Chadwick justice. My heart was full and satisfied when I left the theater. I loved the action scenes in it and had a few lines here and there that was funny and contributed to keeping myself and my teen engaged. Even though the film is long, it didn't feel like it when watching it. The time went by fast, which is a sign that a film is well done and was executed well. This film really got me excited for what they plan on doing in the future within the Marvel Universe.

Also the contrast between how different Black Panthers inhabit that role, and the implications of that.I loved the new world discovered, with its own mythology, and the way those two worlds can come together, for good or ill. I can't wait to see where the story goes next.Beautiful scenes and fun story with great characters. And the tribute to Chadwick Boseman, both his character and the actor, were deeply moving and tastefully done. Great soundtrack too.

The first time I went to see it I thought maybe it's because I'm tired and I'm coming to see it after work, so I went to see it again in a matinee and I made sure I was well rested and I fell asleep again. It was unnecessarily long, lacking of an interesting or compelling character with exception of Queen Ramonda, the story....what story?! It was a movie made to push a message that's all. And it's such a shame since I loved the first movie and was looking forward to this sequel."

9," Best marvel movie of the year
",adriano-40012,/user/ur69368647/,17 November 2022,"A tough movie for the crew to make when you think about the circumstances off the loss of Chadwick Boseman. I'll be honest here it was the least movie from marvel studios I was anticipating for until I saw the trailer then I got a really good feeling. Thor was a disappointment and Dr. Strange struggled due to new writings, but Wakanda Forever mastered its problems in the best possible way. You can feel the spirit of T'Challa during the entire movie, not overused or forced just authentic &worthy. Me as the audience I got swept into the movie and literally share the loss and grief.Wakanda is in the middle of the story. Since T'Challa revealed its country and resources other countries try to steal them and it adds a very scary and realistic political vibe to it. I like the narrative a lot. The problem is for me Riri Williams some times the character interrupts the atmosphere of the movie and makes it feel like Marvel needs to introduce the character to tease for the future. Don't get me wrong the character of her is not the problem, it's just the wrong movie and time to be introduced. Her chemistry with Shuri and the Queen was there, but as I said if they cut the character out it would shorten the movie and make it even better.Ramonda played by Angela Bassett delivers the most for me. Her performance was amazing and gave me goosebumps. While Shuri deals with the loss of her brother in hiding behind her tools and technology, Ramonda has to stand up for Wakanda and go public and defend it. She has a strong and tough personality.Namor is an exceptional character which I enjoyed. Finally another decent villain with a good background and interesting colony under water. Great abilities, design and persona. Thank God, Marvel didn't waste his Potential by killing him off. I was actually rooting for him at some point and his motives were understandable. I'm pretty sure we're going to see much more and learn more from him and his folks.The director did an unreal job here and probs to the writers as well. I can barely imagine how difficult it was to create a movie when you know the main characters actor Chadwick has passed. They deserve all the love and appreciation from the audience it can get.Shout out to the crew for creating thrilling action sequences, amazing design & costumes and the CGI looks great. The music was also perfect. I remember the under water town and when that music started I was totally flashed.The minor reasons why I rate it 9/10 is due to the unnecessary introduction of Riri Williams and the length of the movie. A great movie to end Phase 4 and I'll never forget Chadwick Boseman, RIP !"
9," A great end to phase 4
",sadiec-05559,/user/ur158912592/,17 November 2022,"One of the most phenomenal and beautiful pieces of art that Marvel has ever released. The character development in this movie is absolutely outstanding and there was definitely some award worthy performances. The introduction of a new characters was very successful and needed, they definitely added a breath of fresh air. The music score of Wakanda Forever was also fantastic, every song set the mood of the scene perfectly. As far as the movies go (think there's one more Tv series coming up) this was a great to the 4th phase of this universe and I hope phase 5 will be an improvement and less of a rushed mess."
10," Heartbreaking.
",alfiengo,/user/ur130716417/,16 November 2022,"Everything about this movie was great. Every single emotions that minorities sometimes feels in this world, were portrayed in this movie. It felt like a beautiful hommage to Chadwick but also to people of color all across the globe. The subtle meaning to every passages were brilliant. They were able to incorporate a fictional world and our sad realities in this movie.As a black man, I think that the part that motivates me the most is the amazing crew behind this movie. Ryan Cooler is a gifted talented man whom I would love to work with one day. His vision is so precise, and as a screenwriter and a actor, I believe that we should put more heart and soul within our projects, and that's exactly what Black Panther : Wakanda Forever did. Well done !"
9," BPF (or Way of the (A)water)
",kosmasp,/user/ur5876717/,16 November 2022,"Like BFF - but different, so no pun intended I reckon? In case it is unclear: Black Panther Forever as in Best Friends Forever. You very likely have heard of the latter - I made up the former. And while it may feel like I am sort of answering the main question here ... I really am not. The title is even going that extra mile to avoid the question ... of the successor.Now I do assume you have seen the first movie ... and while this of course is playing in the MCU and it makes sense to know all the other entries in that world too ... the one that is most important is the first Black Panther movie. As you may or may not know, Chadwick Boseman passed away (apparently no one knew he was ill while he was out there filming as much things as he could).That leaves quite the big shadow (or shoes) to fill. And the question is if anyone is going to ... and if so ... who that person is going to be. I think you will be able to determine to answer those questions for yourself ... way before the movie is over.That all being said and while this is not the first anything (something that the marketing department was adamant to stress out while the first movie was released), the impact this is having for POC and their perception and how they feel about movies and superheroes is probably something that cannot be measured. Kudos to the Ryan and all involved for making this.It may not further a lot of other things in the MCU (I am surprised this is bookmarked as end of phase 4), but it is quite focused on its story. Having a lot and enough shockers to keep you on the edge of your seat. The action choreography is good, some slow motion may feel weird I reckon ... but it works wonders overall.This is being released in November with Avatar 2 coming out in December - both featuring water a lot ... and ""blue (wo)men"". Not sure if there are even more connections ... well both being released by Disney and having fantastical elements to them of course.This has a strong female component to it. Way more than the first had, which already was filled with it. Great acting too - and a new enemy/friend buried deep and therefor never seen before ... on shore (more puns you say?).The 160 minutes went by like nothing. Not that everything felt like it went smoothly or without any hiccups, but if you suspend your disbelief or have drank the kool-aid like I did ... well you will like it. For a friend of mine who watched this with me (Imax 3D no less), this was the best one after the Spiderman movie in this phase. I have not thought too much about it, but there might be some common ground I share with him on that.Technically looking good and the CGI works overall (although in shots from farther away you can still see when character move way too fast and ""unnatural"") ... I doubt it will be able to hold a candle to Avatar 2 ... the preview alone made me feel like this will set new bars that no one will be able to reach (the first one still is the best 3D movie out there ... 14 years later!) ... Black and Blue Panther ... with enough jokes, drama and action to keep you interested all the time."
7," Loved it BUT....
",Rainman53929,/user/ur24819879/,16 November 2022,I loved this film in so many ways. Tribute was done perfectly and villain casting was a bullseye. Story was great as well but I feel Nakia should have been the new Black Panther. As a spy with more fight experience and seasoned in the game would have made a far better fit. I didn't find final climax between Namar & Panther wasn't believable at all. He had decades of fight experience which showed easily in his fight choreography and she was by far outmatched but the film did require she be victorious but wasn't done in a way could believe. Leaving sister as tech genius would have made for a better story. That's the only issue I had with this project/film and why I rated it a 7.5/10..
6," Not for me
",blackeyce,/user/ur153348224/,16 November 2022,I felt like it was boring for the most part just too many slow scenes and unnecessary scenes that could've been cut. And I honestly didn't really care for the villain plot it felt like Kilmongers same logic being used again for the villains main goals & intentions. The action scenes were good but it wasn't much of that until an hour or so into the story. Which makes the story pacing seem to last forever. Also the villains perspective? Couldnt even relate to it his reaction to the outside world seemed rather late as he waited so long to even make a attempt to wage war and get revenge which just doesn't make sense when you see how powerful he was at such an young age. And there was an absurdly large amount of female characters in the movie it was hardly any male representation in the story. I don't mind female characters especially Okoye and Nakia I love both. But without the male character M'Baku it feels like you go majority of the movie with just female characters and that sucks. I truly missed Chadwick and his presence in the movie. Black Panther just won't be the same without him. Overall not one of the better Marvel movies.
9," Best Marvel Movie This Year
",daydreamer-85787,/user/ur113720445/,16 November 2022,"This movie did not disappoint! It paid wonderful homage to Chadwick Boseman and his character, but also outlined how the franchise can move forward.Loved how Namor and his back story, his kingdom, and his motives were explored in depth, because it leaves room for people to feel ambiguity towards him, we both sympathize with him and are scared of him.All the returning cast members were amazing, of course. Really liked Shuri's journey. Really liked how we see more of Wakanda as a city. The moments of humor in the movie were not forced, but well integrated with the script.Whenever the action takes place, it is choreographed well. I just wished we got to see a bit more of the new black panther in action?Certainly the best movie Marvel brought out this year, because Doctor Strange and Thor: Love and Thunder were so disappointing. But even without the comparison to poorly made movies, this movie stands out with its visuals, it's plot, and it's emotional tone."
8," Namor gets a better origin
",georgeh52,/user/ur69586897/,16 November 2022,SPOILER ALERT! Look the other way if you have not seen #wakandaforever 1) i thought the rewrite of Namor's origin was pretty clever and addressed some practical issues we didn't worry about when we read comic books as kids. 2) the writing was pretty good because the leader of the Gorilla clan had good advice for Shuri which foreshadowed something that happens at the end of the movie. 3) i am happy Marvel finally spelled out what Julia Louis Dreyfus is supposed to be after we saw her talking to Belena the new Black Widow and John Walker the disgraced Captain America on Disney Plus TV. 4) i am also happy that agent Martin Freeman was a pawn who was played by Dreyfus. If we are talking spy plots then surprises and double dealing are good to include.ðŸ˜�

",bechirtebourbi,/user/ur152603214/,16 November 2022,"If we ignore the fact that the movie feels like a feminist movement, there are so many plot holes to be listed, for example:-Why wasn't any of the avengers at T'challa's funeral?-Why didn't the queen do that fighting ritual to earn the throne like T'challa and killmonger did?-How is a 19-year-old college student able to build a machine that no one has created before, that's able to detect a metal she knows nothing about? Just because it's a fictional movie, you can't give characters unlimited knowledge.-How did Namor find Wakanda? Isn't the city hidden? How does he even know about Wakanda?-How did Riri create an iron-man suit? There's no way she has the money for the materials required, not to mention, how did she even create an energy source?-Why would the queen sacrifice her life and leave her country in jeopardy over a girl she never met?

3," Very weak and mediocre movie
",akhil027,/user/ur70587126/,16 November 2022,"We have reached a point at which people will watch anything that has the tag ""Marvel"" on it. I kept fighting to prevent myself from falling asleep during the first hour. It's incredibly slow and nothing interesting happens. Namor and Talokans could be terrifying but couldn't reach their full potential.The forced jokes weren't funny at all. The action sequences doesn't look good. The background tracks/scores were too much or had no control. It stood seperate from what's happening.I can understand why they should be grieving but grief isn't so good for a marvel movie. They didn't handle it well either. The wow factor is missing and the whole movie falls flat."
8," An movie that is almost was epic as a Avengers movie, but in a different way. Though I do have a few complaints.
",rchosen-193-5535,/user/ur57306456/,16 November 2022,"I loved the first movie of course and like many was shocked by Chadwicks passing. And like many we were on pins and needles wondering how it would be handled with the second movie. The trailer looked great but still me a bit nervous. Could the movie hold up with Chadwick? Would their choices work? How will the story change the MCU given Chadwicks death?I can safely say they nailed it with only a few complaints from myself.For starters this movie is nearly three hours long. And I can see why. I feel they could have almost made it even longer given how much goes on in this movie. I don't want to say the movie is rushed, but its scale is massive and they really had to cram what they could into under three hours. This is perhaps my only complaint, because of its scale you are really bombarded with endless information and still have some questions. Granted I realize it may also feel this way due to having to rewrite and add more to the story involving the original Black Panther. Again, this is a minor complaint.The movie itself is way more than just an average Marvel movie. It felt more like an Avengers movie in terms of scale and epicness. I was blown away by everything. There is a lot of dialogue at times, probably to the point that some may not like it. However at no point did I feel like ""This is boring, move on!"". Every word of dialogue has meaning and emotion behind it. While this movie is for sure about good vs bad, its very much about mourning, death, acceptance and trying to figure out who you are and what you want to do. Death can lead to people either still being good... or turning bad. It's complicated. And you feel that back and forth in this movie with many characters. I strongly encourage you go into this with tissue. This movie is the one that has made me tear up the most.When it comes to the new enemies, they did a wonderful job with taking from the comics. And everything just felt right with the Mayan culture and stories. The music of Wakanda's people vs Namors people is beautiful. Both give you chills. Especially went the two themes sometimes cross over into each other. This is where perhaps there is another issue though. Namor is amazing, the actor is perfect, the costume is perfect....everything is perfect. But some people while walking out were saying how ""silly"" or ""absurd"" Namors ability to fly with little wings attached to his feet.I know Marvel is slowly bringing mutants into the MCU, and even thought Namor is mentioned as being a mutant (more or less), seeing how feet wings may turn people off because we aren't really used to somewhat silly looking things. Though if you watch Thos, none of this should be that shocking. If people can get past and just accept Namors mutant feet wings, you will enjoy him overall.Another issue the movie minorly affects it is the CGI. Let's face it, underwater stuff is still hard to get people to believe. It's just not something we are used to. It may look beautiful, but your mind still may find it hard to grasp how the underwater cities work. People swimming around, merchants just in the water with floating merchant stands...etc. It just feels weird. It could just be me of course. That said the scenes are very beautiful underwater. Another issue is the end battle, while well done, sometimes felt a bit off. Without going into to much detail, I'll just say a battle takes place on the water and it just looked and felt weird. Not awful mind you, just out of place.Shuri was just amazing. Alot of the focus was on her. You could feel the emotions in everything she said and did. Same with her mother. Perhaps the only minor complaint I could come up with for characters is Ri Ri Williams (aka Iron Heart). While I did enjoy seeing the character on the big screen, something about her felt off. It may just be the tone of the movie is taking away from her character. I also can hear some people whining about she's a black woman whos the next Iron Man. Get over it people. I'm a white guy, I loved it! I am glad she is getting her own series on Disney so we can explore her more and get more attached.Lastly we have Chadwick/Black Panther. Disney really nailed it. The opening wastes no time getting into why T'challa is not in this. It hits deep and the emotions are very strong. They may have been having a celebration for T'challas life in the start, but you could feel it was really also a celebration of Chadwick (without mention of course). I'm glad they didn't go down a terrible road of having him appear in some weird CGI version. We don't see him. We don't see what happens. We just see a start with a emotional ""here's what happened"" moment.You may be asking why did I give this a 8 out of 10 with so many complaints. Well they were all really minor. And mainly going by what I heard others talking about as we left the theater. In the end this movie is a epic movie of its own kind. It's a memorial to Chadwick/T'Challa while also opening up the future of the series more. I will likely see it again just because the scale of it had so much to look a that a second watch is needed. Oh and if your wanting for a after credits scene, there is none. There is one scene after about 30 second of credits, then after that scene its regular credits and the movie just ends. They made a good choice to end it like that."
3," Banking on the emotions of audiences for Chadwick Boseman
",pippippipilika,/user/ur145299532/,16 November 2022,"Did the world need another Black Panther movie after Chadwik's passing? NO.Did Marvel need another Black Panther movie to make more money? Absolutely yes !!!So what should Marvel do that appeal audiences without making that intention obvious? Simple, make it like this is a tribute to Chadwik and he would have wanted this series to go on. Very clever advertising and a heart wrenching trailer which of course gonna pull the strings of his fan's hearts were made and i am not ashamed to admit that my tears were flowing freely in the funeral scene and it showed in the Cast faces that they felt the same emotion.And from there, there was nothing but just conversation after conversation. Namor's back story was presented with perfect visuals but the reasoning for his aggressive behavior could have been stronger. Just from finding one machine he became violent and wanted to finish Wakanda and Surface World if Wakanda doesn't incorporate !!! Just shows how unhinged the leaders truly are.If there was more damage to his people or property, it might have been believable. Makers wasted hours in conversation but couldn't add some more reasoning for Namor's destructive behavior!!!The action sequences were brief and the final battle between Shuri and Namor was needed to be a bit more elaborate. The fight between Black Panther and KillMonger was so epic, this one totally fades in comparison. Also agrees with Okoye, the Midnight Angel costume was not very eye pleasing, especially the head piece. It looked like a Power Puff girl suit. But Queen Ramonda's costumes were top notch, no doubt about it.Yes, establishing a new character takes time. Need to tell the back story, the origin, the purpose of introducing it in a new movie. When the situation is like this, do it properly, make it a Series because now they have the platform for releasing those, justify the purpose of the story they are telling. Banking on people's emotion for a beloved actor's passing ,just so that they can earn more money, this is not a justified reason to make a 2 and a half hour movie which is as boring as rest of the Phase 4 movies (except Shang-Chi). Though must admit, it's less pathetic than the others.And the best scene of the movie was the grilling chicken at the end.Also my 3 stars are for Chadwik, the funeral scene, the Marvel logo containing his pictures and the end credit with his footages from Black Panther. My tears wouldn't stop.I guess, with Phase 4 ending, i am also serving ties with Marvel because i don't see how they gonna make anything logical and interesting than what they have been making since End Game even with big name directors and actors."
6," Decently dull plot
",leetheodore,/user/ur133341001/,16 November 2022,"The movie started pretty well, with an emotional tribute to Boseman, but it lingered with long dialogues and pointless expositions. It was surprisingly dull, and I was just waiting for action. Don't get me wrong, the acting by Bassettt (Queen Ramonda) and Gurira (Okoye) were so good to watch. But the character development was lackluster and seemed to be the most genius person ever. She was more of a plot device and I wasn't sure why she was there at all.Also, why can't someone else be the black panther. Shuri has also been more of a smug, smart character in the MCU, not much of a fighter. Okoye would be a good candidate. Ramonda would be great too! I mean, Bassett's arm was so huge, it made Natalie Portman's tiny. Can you believe she is 64 years old?Overall, it ended with an okay final fight and the issues were resolved in a matter of scenes. The final few scenes and mid credit scene were another great tribute to Boseman, however by that point I was just glad the movie was over. Marvel's phase 4 has been quite a disappointment, and it's just non-stop pumping out low quality content.6/10."
5," Good special effects, good story, but boring and a bit too ""political""
",mareleblond-11956,/user/ur158366873/,16 November 2022,"The title sums it up + there are no true and convincing main characters, maybe just Namor, the others are dull and annoying, unconvincing.On top of this, yet again, black (women/teen) power (a 19y old black teenage girl, built in 2 months a machine that basically started the whole plot of the movie - I love a good SciFi, but not ""political"" SciFi), the westerners/whites are evil.Most of the first half of the movie is quite boring, too much intrigue, not enough action and when action does happen, it's a bit unconvincing, for example Namor talks about the huge numbers of his army, the unbelievable strenght, etc, etc and he attacks Wakanda with a few dozen people. Same for the last battle scene."
2," Weak plot, questionable CGI, not great
",fearthemcneil,/user/ur61047694/,16 November 2022,"So, the CGI is so hit and miss here it's hilarious. Sometimes it looks great, other times it looks like a Blizzard cutscene from 2008 all over again. Some of the acting is overdone to the point that I think some of these people think they're in a Shakespeare play. Angela Bassett namely seems to get more and more over the top with every scene. She screams and overenunciates with her overly dramatic fake accent to the point that I laughed at certain times.The plot is bad, like really bad. Apparently a 19 year old girl created a machine that can detect vibranium and the US government never bothered to have a single engineer or scientist reverse engineer this machine in case it ever broke or needed to be fixed. Naaaah, just throw it in the ocean It'll be fine. Then Namor has the brilliant plan to just kill the 19 year old girl and that'll stop the detection process. Wow, what a dumb plan right? Yes, except somehow he may be right because the government was so shortsighted in this world Ryan Coogler has envisioned that they just threw it in the ocean without understanding how it worked. Everyone other than the Wakandans in this movie are so dumb in order to advance the plot that eventually you start to roll your eyes. The first Black Panther was cool, this movie not so much."

",Filipe_R_Santos89,/user/ur58655148/,16 November 2022,"After the last few Marvel movies/series, I was starting to feel a little tired of the same formula and lack of impact.I went to see this movie a little apprehensive but not even a third of the way through the movie I was already involved. The story is well done, well connected to the past events of the MCU and the homage and attention to keeping the memory Chadewick Boseman present in the film was of profound delicacy.Namor was one of the characters I was looking forward to seeing, and I have to say that the scenes in the water were stupendous and the whole connection to the Mayan culture and colonization was well achieved.Riri Williams made me even more anxious to see IronHeart, and I must confess that Letitia Wright really surprised me on the positive side - applause to this actress.A long film no doubt, but a very good one and worth the wait and see."

",minttu-47746,/user/ur134151836/,16 November 2022,"This movie was breathtaking in so many ways - the aesthetics were even more impressive than in the first one, and the performances felt more personal - they all became more full-fledged characters than the first time around, making it easier to grief, worry, and persist with them as their stories unfolded on screen.The Talokan and its people were an excellent addition to the world of MCU and I can't wait to see more of them! Slight spoiler here - I just LOVED how they suggested that a certain sea lore was based on their people. And how it was shown on the screen? Still sends shivers down my spine.Summa summarum - definitely going to see it again and I recommend others to do so too. Of course tastes vary, but for me, Wakanda Forever made me love cinema again, and really appreciate film industry experts as artists."

10," A Fantastic, Emotional, Spectaculae Mature Marvel Film and The Amazing Marvel Legacy
",razvanciobo,/user/ur85186054/,16 November 2022,"Picking up six years after the events of Black Panther (in accordance to the events of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame), this film focuses heavily on the loss of T'Challa and how the country can move forward without their leader. With the emergence of Namor and the underwater city of Talokan threatening all of Wakanda, the remaining characters must band together and protect their country. Shuri (Letitia Wright) is easily the one with the most screentime here and the burden of carrying this franchise is on her shoulders the whole time. This must have been a daunting task, but she pulled it off. Her character, along with her mother, portrayed incredibly well once again by Angela Basset, are the beating hearts of this film. The emotional aspect of this film got me on a few occasions.One year after the untimely death of King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the African kingdom of Wakanda is still in mourning as they struggle without their beloved monarch to lead them. T'Challa's younger sister, Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright), feels the immense pressure to take over as ruler but believes she cannot handle such a huge responsibility all by herself. Not long after, the inhabitants of the underwater civilisation of Talokan, led by King Namor (Tenoch Huerta), emerge to wage a war against the surface world. With limited time remaining, the citizens of Wakanda must quickly overcome their grief to put a stop to the Talokan threat before everything is destroyed.Given the unexpected turn of events surrounding the death of its main star, this film works surprisingly well with its remaining cast members and a more interesting look at Wakanda's place in the MCU. This is a movie to see on the big screen, without a doubt this is the best film the MCU has delivered in the Phase 4. The fact that they incorporated his passing into the story beautifully was so important & crucial. Ryan Coogler is probably the best director working for Marvel right now and I'm very excited to see what he does next after this big win.Wakanda Forever"" is MCU's 30-th movie and is phenomenal! The most powerful project of Phase 4.Immensely powerful story of forging forward-shattering at times, but also beautifully cathartic and heartening, still cannot get over how well the film earns that title.If Chadwick could see this movie, he'll be proud as much as I am right now!Namor is a great villain and Shuris arc in the course of this movie was amazing and some of marvels best character arc. Seeing wakanda vs Tolkan l was thrilling and both sides had really good points and arguments. The performances across the board were perfect and riri made a great addition to the movie. I do have some issues with the movie however the action at points can be a bit generic and in the third act there's a montage used to try and get the characters ready for the final battle and feels a bit lazy. But aside from that this has to be one of the better marvel movies and worthy successor to the original black panther."

",fmrky,/user/ur154793241/,16 November 2022,"I came in the movie not really knowing what to expect... but i love it. The movie is complex. Less about black panther and more about the struggles of lost, duty, power... its the unexpected. The acting was amazing. The storyline was not cheap. It was well layered. I think the sequel definitely blew all the other marvel movies out the water. I was worried about marvel until this came out. Now im very excited about antman. Kudos to the team and people who made the movie. There was a lot of heart in it and definitely felt it. I dont understand the negative reviews honestly. They may have been expecting fast and the furious. Back this was a perfect balance of Marvel and just good stpry telling. Nothing was forced.Heading back for another view this weekend."
10," Beautiful Story and Tribute
",bench_work32,/user/ur58178652/,16 November 2022,"Black Panther went from gorgeous Black excellence with proud Black men and Black women scientists and heroes and...added indigenous heroes and indigenous wounds and beautiful stories of a nation that survived. I only wish I had been in a beautiful BIPOC audience when ""a colonizer in chains, now I truly have seen everything"" was said. I could practically hear the cheers and whoops and jeers even though the theater I was in remained silent except for my laughter.The story had an invisible string that pulled you along from the first word spoken to the last word in the post-credit scene which I know sounds normal but not every movie does that and a rare few do it as beautifully as this one did. I'll follow Ryan Coogler into the depths of storytelling. He truly knows how to do it.Chadwick's legacy and biography was stitched into T'Challa's with grace and wonder. I've never seen a cast handle the loss of a friend the way this one has. They kept his spirit with them through everything and you could feel it through the screen.I'll forever hold Black Panther near and dear to my heart. I'm so glad to add the sequel to that podium.Rest in peace, Chadwick
Wakanda ForeverðŸ–¤And somebody give Angela Bassett an Oscar already!"
10," A masterpiece, full of emotions, good actings and a evolving plot
",Boolmer,/user/ur158882335/,16 November 2022,"I am not a huge Black Panther fan, but damn this may be the best marvel movie since endgame, the context in real life about Chadwik Boseman's death is important for the movie, the fact that this is a tribute for this him, and it do it's job, the movie carries the melancholy that came with his death and the hope and optimism that he always tried to transmith in his life, the figurines are just fantastic, the soundtrack is compelling, the actings are brilliant, highlights for Letitia Wright(Suhri), Angela Bassett(Queen Ramonda), Danai Gurira(General Okoye) and Tenoch Huerta(Namor), the suspense scene in the ocean is a little meh at the start but is really terrifying at the end, the action sequences are beaultifull and frantic, but could be a little more creative, the movie is sure a 10 for me, but not to say the movie was perfect, Riri Willians is a loose piece in the movie, even if she is a genius ino way a teenage would build a machine to find vibranium for a school project, also she is a a little boring and annoying, she is only in this movie to sell some toys, i like her armor buy she don't fit the whole movie vibe and even in the action scenes she basically has the same action sequence two times in the movie with a diferent armor, i hope she'll be better developed in ""Armor Wars"" and her own series, she has such a potencial to be a brilliant carachter."
3," Black Panther without Black Panther
",vaweber,/user/ur72797176/,16 November 2022,"And Namor without Namor. The MCU stumbles further down the wrong path with a movie that could have drawn from hundreds of great Black Panther arcs, but chose to use the newer, weaker, woker comics stories of the last 10 years. T'Challa should have been recast as Chadwick Bozeman and his family desired. Namor should have been the Avenging Son, The Savage Sub-Mariner, Prince Namor of Atlantis. But instead he was Cuckoo Khan or whatever. Chadwick's tributes were touching but too many and crossing the border from tribute to exploitation. Martin Freedman was usless and wasted. Angela Bassett was a highlight, and in my mind would have been a better Black Panther than a 90lb girl. The fights were not engaging and Namor's motivations were just dumb. And I won't even mention The Red Power Ranger, Riri Williams. She deserves none. 3 stars for Chadwick and Angela."

",cas-junior-br,/user/ur31160172/,16 November 2022,Better than the first and better of the most hero movies this year wakanda forever is about lost and about love and redemption... Is comic accurate where need to be and better than comic where it can't be ...namor had a better origin story than in comics shuri (Letitia) is a surprise I was not expecting that she could pull up a better black panther than Chadwick but she delivered a black panther that was more than just a homage but a totally different character beyond the girl and their gadgets it's noticeble the change of Shuru mood ... It was emotional and I like a lot thanks to all the exceptional artist involved.
9," Solid MCU Entry to end this saga
",hopdan-23986,/user/ur158881325/,16 November 2022,"After avoiding the first BP due to the bad reviews I read, I was excited to see this one in person, and I am glad I did. Yea, I understand the frustration from marvel/Disney lately, but some viewers rush to make critical opinions. Sure this movie had more females in the cast but was it objectively targeted at girls? NO. I don't understand the dislike towards Riri. Did her character feel a little forced into the script? Yea. Did the final iron suit look strange-also, yea. But the actress who played Riri gave a strong performance and blended well into the cast. I feel like many guys are bitter because the character is female. The movie had strong performances from male actors like Jordan and Winston. Overall I enjoyed the film as it provides a deep sense of how Shuri dealt with grief. Maybe it could have been shorter, and some moments might have been predictable, but this movie held my attention all the way through. Talokan is an intriguing new destination in the MCU, and Namor plays a great villain even if some people do not consider him one. Suppose I could change anything about the ending; I wanted Shuri to force Namor into revealing the underwater vibranium. I have higher hope now for the iron heart series. See the movie and make your own opinion, or you could miss this gem."
9," They live in you
",simsbros-89231,/user/ur85223426/,16 November 2022,"This is a beautiful film. It is attempting to be many things and it succeeds at being them for the most part. At once a superhero film, a sequel, a tribute, a comic adaptation and a chapter in the beloved MCU this film had the nearly impossible task of making a sequel to a cultural cornerstone of a movie and moving forward without that films lead. What we get in the end is a remarkable story about the inevitability of loss, but the onset of understanding that comes with grief and ultimately acceptance.The film is well made in every regard. This particular corner of the MCU bears a regality and a standard of production that puts many others to shame. That remains the case, with the costume design, music, visuals, and shot composition all being top notch and pristine. But where it truly shines is its ensemble cast. Everyone brings their best, and you can tell that the actors were passionate about making this film the best it could be. Bassett, a known powerhouse delivers an Oscar worthy performance as Ramonda. Danai Guriria is a unique and stalwart presence in this franchise and shines yet again. Tenoch Huerta delivers a menacing, calculating performance that will have Americans wondering why this guy isn't a huge star already. But the real star it the show is Letitia Wright. Her character shuri goes through so much on screen and has to carry the emotional weight of the film on her shoulders. The happy go lucky girl from the first film is no more. Letitia steps up to the plate and achieves greatness. Her acting is simply fantastic in this movie and you feel every emotion she feels throughout in a performance that is at times haunting and visceral, especially in act 3.As a superhero film it also delivers thrilling high octane action and amazing visual scenes such as the introduction of Talokan backed with gorgeous music by Ludwig Goransson. It is a film to be watched with an audience, an experience to be shared with loved ones.At its core it is a tribute and send-off for the late great Chadwick Boseman whos life was tragically cut short 2 years ago. Within the confines of this film can be found thenes of loss, suffering, faith and the legacy that our loved ones leave behind in death. Do their wants and desires for us matter? Do they define who we are and who we are to become? Should they?All of these make for some amazing storytelling bears that culminates in a bittersweet finale that is beautiful in its restraint.I could go on and on about this film and what it accomplished. But it will suffice to say thus is one of the best CBMs of all time in my book. It will be remembered for a long time to come, and you dont even have to be a superhero fan to enjoy it. The only flaw I will consider is involving a certain subplot that is set up for future films, but it is hardly bad... just less resolved than I'd like.The film is immaculate. Give it a watch and bring tissues."
5," There is someone else
",nogodnomasters,/user/ur77881167/,16 November 2022,"There is a mini tribute to Chadwick Boseman in the beginning. It was not as long or touching as the Paul Walker tribute in ""Fast and Furious"" (I forgot which number). With the protector dead the planet wants Wakanda to share its vibranium, which they refuse. While drilling in the ocean the CIA discovers a separate deposit of vibranium and it is protected by descendants of the Olmecs who can absorb oxygen through water. Namor (Tenoch Huerta) is their ""god"" and protector. They destroy the CIA's boat. Namor wants to unite with Wakanda and destroy the other surface dwellers. Shuri (Letitia Wright) does some investigating which takes her to MIT (Coming to America) where we discover the young inventor of the vibranium detector and she also has an Iron Woman suit.I found this too heavy for a Marvel film. The humor was hardly there, making sport of baldness and fashion. I didn't like the script. Of course I would have complained if they CG Chadwick or if he left his mask on the whole time."

",johndavidson-1,/user/ur3512547/,16 November 2022,"Chadwick Boseman's untimely death casts a long shadow over this movie. It deals respectfully with his absence and leans in to the associated grief as it's major theme .The result is a sombre affair that lacks the sparkle of the best movies in the MCU and while it doesn't stumble as badly as Eternals , the whole middle section of the movie spends too much time flounder around in (not) Atlantis telling Namor's back story.It comes together in an obligatory fight scene at the end but these mass combats feature too many minor characters that we don't really care enough about to really justify the length. The main showdown delivers (when it does arrive) but again it takes a long time to get going."

",hildegardhootiecackle,/user/ur153713169/,16 November 2022,"I honestly love this movie, but you have to be willing to just go alone for the ride. Sure there are some times that the plot seems a little slow, but this is not an easy time for the people of Wakanda or his family. I think the character Shuri had a pretty amazing development in this movie. Overall I think that this is a great addition to the marvel movie family, sure it's not the greatest, but it's not the worst by a long shot. The culture & effects are just amazing if you find the story lacking. Just go for the ride & enjoy the story being told for what it is not what we think it should be!"
7," Fine film, but the first movie was better.
",jebyvyson,/user/ur73504668/,15 November 2022,"Before I give my review of this movie, I have some things to say.: I disagreed about the continuation of this film without recasting the character, T'challa/Black Panther due to the sudden passing of Chadwick Boseman. Chadwick's death hit hard on everybody, but I still want to see the character's story and journey in the MCU, but I guess the studio see that Chadwick is irreplaceable, which is understandable, but I also think they should wait awhile to start production of this film. Ever since Phase 4 started, it has been overall mediocre to begin with. The only acceptable of good out of this phase was Spider-Man: No Way Home and Shang-Chi. The rest of the movies and Disney shows have potential with good moments in them, but it all falls flat with its writing, direction, and some weird agenda they have going on. Because of this, BP: Wakanda Forever will be my last MCU film. After Endgame ended, things haven't been the same. Now, my review.I enjoyed the tribute for Chadwick at the beginning of the movie and Shuri was up next to the throne of Wakanda. After that, it became slow-paced film. There were some good jokes in there, but I wish they could tone it down a bit from one character. I don't like how they dumb down Shuri's character being how she's supposably a smart character into what she is in the film. The editing of this film is a bit weird and the final fight scene was over the place. Namor was a good antagonist, but not as good as the other bad guy characters in the rest of the MCU. The movie was overall an average action superhero movie. I don't think it will be memorable as the first movie since the movie felt high spirited and the second film was just fine."
8," Highly enjoyable
",pmailman,/user/ur8890024/,15 November 2022,"I enjoyed this movie more than I expected to. It was hard to see how a new Black Panther movie could be made witnout Chadwick Boseman, who so defined the character onscreen. But Wakanda Forever was a truly worthy sequel. But the story arc continued true in so many ways to its predecessor. Performances were excellent, cinematography superb.My only beef is the introduction of an origin story and setting for the character Namor that had no connection whatsoever to that of the Namor of the comic books other than being related to an underwater civilization. Not even a veneer of an attempt at reconciliation. Oh well."
8," Deciding to focus on characters makes it slower but...
",ayoreinf,/user/ur16320420/,15 November 2022,"I've got an issue with some of the decisions made by the producers and the creative team of the movie, even if I can understand some o the solutions they chose. I'm not sure they had to kill T'Challa, but I do understand the difficulties of replacing the like of Chadwick Boseman who made the role his own. I'm not sure they had to present Namor the way they did, even though his character in the comics allows for this option, but it does limit what they can do with him in the future. And I don't like the fact they kill other leading characters almost as an easy way out.All that said, this wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't disjointed as other reviewers here suggested - I spoke with a few that watched the movie with me - we had no problem following the plot. It was definitely a very slow action movie - as my title says - that's a result of the decision to focus on the characters, and this is a decision I do agree with. It did present us with a lot of superb acting performances with Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett and Danai Gurira topping the list, but with almost no false note in the entire cast. And when the roles are so well performed the slow pace of the movie doesn't make it any less riveting. Again, the role of Namor does leave a lot to be desired, though they did try to give him some depth, but I think they made him a bit too contradictory and so very hard to play and relate to.Bottom line, the moment they decided to make the new Black Panther a she, they were bound to face a lot of animosity on this site. It comes with the territory over here, and I know I'm going to pay with a lot of hate, here - I'm half expecting it by now. But I liked the way they dealt with the issue of grief and international politics. And even if the role of Riri was shoved into the movie for external reasons I don't think it hurt the movie in any way."
6," Wakanda forever...
",Kermitwfrancis,/user/ur28605462/,15 November 2022,Sloppy movie. Could have been an hour shorter. Great actors. I left crying. But I also left twice to go to the bathroom and I don't believe I missed anything. I know you'll make a lot of money with another one but please don't make one. I'm a big fan of marvel movies but half of them I haven't watched more than once and the half I've watched a dozen times. I will not watch this movie ever again. Ever thought about doing a meta verse thing and killmonger be the black panther? You could just made a basic superhero with a star and everyone would have loved it. Instead you made an unnecessary movie and most people will not be interested when you make another one. You've thored it. Or iron man 2 and 3ed it.

",Mehki_Girl,/user/ur4258330/,15 November 2022,"I don't have an argument for the people that didn't particularly like the movie, but didn't hate it either and their concerns - length, slow parts, continuity, etc., have meritThe one reviewer who had problems with the self aggrandizment of the most powerful nation on earth and what he calls their fascist-nationalism, I do have a bone to pick.He's totally missing their stance. In the face of what America, arguably the most powerful nation on earth has down to less powerful nations and historically what the Europeans/Colonizers have done to native peoples, there are concrete reasons for both groups to jealously protect their assets and not share it with the world.What part of the powerful enslaving the vulnerable didn't he get?So it's hell to the, no, for both groups to allow vibranium into the hands of the Colonizers. Like one character said, imagine what America would be doing with it if it had it.I'll give you minute to think about it.Finished?Yeah, the black sand brown peoples would all be dead and vacation codos for the rich would take their place.That reviewer has a lot of up votes, but we all know it's always - it's okay for me, but not for thee.Wakanda will only be Forever as long as they keep their assets out of the hands of the colonizers.

5," Boring, Predictable, Incompetent...
",tdsearles25,/user/ur54273060/,15 November 2022,"I really wanted to like this film, I went in not expecting anything, but curious how they would continue the story without Chadwick. Unfortunately, there wasn't much here that was original or interesting. Oh, the mysterious people form the sea, having conflict with the surface world. Oh, conflict over vibranium, the special object of this story. We have Iron Man and Black Panther replaced by two young girls whose incompetence is just frustrating. They get regularly blindsided throughout the film, for the sake of the plot. The queen dies, simply because she was so defiant. Wasn't prepared. Just silly. And the main villain... His plan was to force Wakanda into an alliance by ::checks notes:: killing the queen and flooding their city? Ok.I'm sorry but MCU phase 4 has been just about a mindless disaster to this point (She Hulk, Thor Love and Thunder, MoM, Falcon, etc). I guess this should be a lesson to never take for granted the special movies that we had during the Infinity Saga. The MCU feels like Star Wars in the sense that they have not been able to recapture the magic. Not sure what the answer is."

",fdhvs,/user/ur136133832/,15 November 2022,"Spider-Man & Shang Chi aside, the recent Marvel efforts have been pretty mediocre so I didn't have high hopes going into this.I liked the opening credit tribute to Chadwick, a genuine talent taken far too early.But then, I'm afraid to say, was 2.5 hours of nonsense.An underwater god sat twiddling his thumbs while Thanos was causing havoc. This film couldn't even be bothered to off a feeble 'Eternals, we promised not to get involved' excuse.What does tempt this wing-footed god to the surface is the worlds most powerful scientist! Sounds justified until you realise it's a precocious brat who is just in in this film to introduce more canon.I won't spoil the post credit scene for you but let me just say the reasoning behind 'the secret' is laughably tenuous."

",jack_o_hasanov_imdb,/user/ur55640799/,15 November 2022,"The movie was long. I went into the movie with no good expectations. Maybe according to this it was better than I expected. It wasn't a bad movie. Of course, the Marvel formula was also here. I really liked the atmosphere and music of the movie. The creation of the new Black Panther or the journey of the creation was good. Since it is in the Marvel formula, the ending of the movie was very predictable. The acting in the movie was good. There were many cliches, of course. Shuri wasn't bad. There was a character in the movie that I was annoyed with and didn't like at all. Iron Heart. Riri. She's a very boring and annoying character. I never liked. Genius ? Seriously ? She was like a spoiled person. The costume was awful. After Iron Man Iron Heart wasn't good at all. So the new Avengers characters were okay. New Hawkeye, new Captain, new Captain Marvel and the others. But this one wasn't good. I'm tired of her scenes. Talokan scenes were very good. Better than Aquaman. I would like to see more and I would like to see it in the future. I wish there were a lot of political scenes in the beginning, but they didn't."

",infoscreengrabr,/user/ur158873035/,15 November 2022,"With such excitement, booking in advance and taking the whole family promising it was going to be well worth the 3 hours. It soon became apparent the movie was simply a sounding bored for cheesy, uninspiring drivel.I was hoping the story would become more interesting but got worse and worse.A nation which is apparently a superpower, got hammered very easily. The continuous self-righteous babbling only prolonged the agony!And i stunned by the strangely yet well written positive reviews that seems to detail in such a professional manner how great this movie is.A plane and simple disappointment and yes the reason why its smashed box office because after the first movie, people had presumed it would have been its equal if not better. Instead it felt like a drawn out story that could have finished in 30minutes.I feel, we will stop going to the cinema to watch marvel movies. Instead enjoy the dark more viable DC movies. Black adam by contrast was excellent, it had its shortcomings but the story gripped you.Over all, wakanda forever becomes another for the bin!"
4," I miss Chadwick Boseman.
",maykalrif,/user/ur72246757/,15 November 2022,"It's very messy, and the story is very bad, maybe because of the rewriting after Chadwick's death. They also talk about the fact that Wakanda is the most technologically advanced country, but that is not clear because of the use of spears and daggers. Also, all the talk about the military strength of Wakanda is just talk. All we see is a group of ships. The idea that a county can develop technology just because they have natural resources is absurd; the most important thing is human resources (the natural resource curse theory). There are also plot holes in the story. Also, the underwater scenes are very bad; they could have done a better job. But the most important thing is the absence of the charisma that Chadwick Boseman had on screen. Chadwick was the best thing about the Black Panther, and his absence will never be overcome; the man was something else, and he will be forever missed."

",chris_rowe-881-168820,/user/ur49237919/,15 November 2022,"I'll be honest I didn't love black panther , it took me three watches to think it was alright, it was hugely heartbreaking that the actor passed away as he seemed a genuinely good person and the world needs them. I've never bought into the thought that this film is only around for equality, think that's ridiculous.This film is beautifully handled, at 3 points I cried and I'm not ashamed, they just did things in such a beautiful way, I'd say it was one of my favourite endings to a marvel film, it was just the right tone and a beautiful moment. It gets you wanting this franchise to succeed, a group of talented lovely people who must've gone through an emotional nightmare.The film is long but flies by, the one question was who's the next panther and IMO I thought it was the perfect choice, there was a couple of shocks but it was just really well done. When it's done well like it is here, there's a real joy in seeing badass women take control and fight, it was great in that respect. It wasn't in your face, the choices and logic just made it work, everyone played their part beautifully.Best antagonist for a long while, really creative and it just creates some awesome scenarios, I know some did hards didn't love it because it ventured from the comics but with what happened I think that's fine. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and as someone who went in as not even a big fan of the franchise I couldn't find a fault.Beautifully handled, great new crafted works, endless potential.

",Jaclyn16,/user/ur3899906/,15 November 2022,"I LOVED this film. I loved the raw emotions it inspired as I watched it. The cast from the first film were back to lead us into the world without King T'Challa, it was a beautiful tribute to the late AMAZING Chadwick Boseman.The leaders of this incredible movie were the ladies, with amazing performances from, Letitia, Lupita, Danai, Angela and Domanique truly inspiring. With amazing cameos from Mikaela and Florence.Winston Duke, Tenoch Huerta, Martin Freeman, were great support and the film for me went at a good pace, to explain and show the world in a new way with the introduction of a great new 'people'. I believe Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a triumph, and the best Marvel film of this phase 4, which has been a little too flippant and lost its way. But then it has amazingly large shoes to fill. Wish they hadn't 'retired' certain characters because the backbone of the entire Marvel Universe was ripped out following the Phase 3 conclusion. I genuinely hope they look back on those movies and remember what got them here. Whoever writes the new assemble movies, please don't let it be
Taika Waititi. Sorry but the two Thor films since the original, and sequel have been wanting in my view."

",canoglumervan,/user/ur158869272/,15 November 2022,"Was such a boring movie only thing that was entertaining was laughing at how stupid the plot line was. All the fighting, destruction and death was completely avoidable if only they had the same sense at the start of the movie. Also how does a 19 year old just build an iron man suit in a random garage when it took one of the smartest people in the marvel universe billions and state of the art technology? Takes away all the credit for how special iron man really was. They also tried to recreate the same scene from iron man where she goes so high up she loses consciousness and wakes up just before landing in the water. I'm really worried for marvel because the new thor movie was almost as bad. Only good side was the actors.If you want to sleep for 2 and a half hours in a big room filled with people go ahead watch this trash."

",Batsy1501,/user/ur96494321/,15 November 2022,"Actually about 8,25. I think the movie's plot was rather straightforward and neither overly dogmatic nor overly clichÃ©. Political elements were appropriately integrated, not imposed. Well-done tribute to Chadwick Boseman. The sounds and visuals were very well done, which helped to intensify the emotions. The vff was good for most of the movie. The pace, especially in act 2 when everything was so rambling and narrative, was definitely the worst aspect. This one and Eternals made the same mistake and they both has bad visual storytelling, they had to talk and try to give us information. Overall, still the best MCU film in 2022."

In addition, the graphics were amazing as usual and the character development was well done. Moreover, the fight scenes are good and enjoyable for the viewer.On the other hand, the movie is based on the good old formula. There was nothing unexpected. Marvel didn't want to take any risks and the result in the end was a movie that is not far from other superhero movies. In my opinion, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever falls into the category of films that are quickly forgotten.In conclusion, this movie is nothing special, but that is no reason for anyone not to watch it. It is enjoyable, beautiful and exactly what anyone expects to see in this kind of movies.Sometimes ordinary is just what is needed!"

Wakanda Forever demands we invest in it emotionally and gives us every reason we should. Many complain it's too ""woke"" for them; they need the comfort of a male lead. They want to see some kickass and bravado and they are too strong to shed a few tears. They should not see this movie because the kickass is there and it has its share of bravado, but you will feel something for it's character's. They are hurting and so will you. But in the end, like this movie, you will be better for it! Thank you Wakanda for not being ""Thor Love/Thunder."" We need to be reminded that even super heroes die too. And thank you No Time to Die for doing the same. Make more of these kind of movies Marvel and a little less ""She Hulk!"""
7," Unnecessarily long and dragged out
",tahnya110,/user/ur37575825/,15 November 2022,"Where do I start with this movie. I liked the 1st one but I didn't love it and I have the same sentiments about this one I don't know why I just can't connect with this movie? Btw isn't the premise of Black Panther very similar to Avatar. Primitive tribal folk who have precious metals (vibranium in BP and Unobtanium in Avatar) and America wants it?First of all the Chadwick tributes were sweet but ultimately took away from the actual movie and became almost a memorial to him? The last credit scene was a very contrived memorial and possible hint to a new black panther movie in the making with his legacy?I felt Tenoch Huerta did an amazing job and the under water world they created was marvelous. But the movie jumped to too many places: Wakanda, Talokan, US, Haiti - I was lost in all the travel.I really did love Shuris character and how she stepped up and how brilliant she is but I didn't really understand her connection with the scientist and what they were hinting there?I was a little confused about Lupitas character and how they claimed she left Wakanda for 6 years? Did that much time pass from Chadwicks character's death in Black Panther? That and the last scene was confusing and a bit cheesy that I thought I was watching a home video.Ultimately I think the movie was good but could have been truncated and could have been more congruent and consistent."
6," Long, boring, uninteresting
",arman_pp,/user/ur33585784/,15 November 2022,"One of the most boring marvel movies to this day. Forgettable action scenes, poor dialogues, 5 year old humour. The graphics and cinematography are cool and well made and the music well fitting. There is more weight put on ""diversity"" and ""feminism"" than the actual scenario.The new black panther is not as an exciting character, the female iron-man came out of nowhere as if she was forced into the movie.The only positive note of the film was Namor. Still, this is far from enough to make the movie worth 3 hours of your life and the your buck in the cinema.Marvel has become a travesty of what it was."
4," Lacks of diversity
",nickegermarhen,/user/ur134585678/,15 November 2022,As an african I am offended that there are no arab or white people included even tho they are also african.The memorial of chad boseman was heartfull and braught me to tears but felt like it was often milked way to much.I appreciate how the film portrays strong woman characters and how they'll succeed without the oppression of men and how advanced and civilized an african state could of been if there was no white colonization influencing the progress of african technology. The african continent would of been the most advanced but unfortunately the countries minerels were stolen and is still to this day being shipped to other countries.
8," BEAUTIFUL AND EMOTIONAL!
",andrewchristianjr,/user/ur79190944/,15 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is able to create a beautiful and emotionally draining storyline and visualization. Aside from being a very fitting tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman, what makes this film great is how its core story represented Africans and Mayans, and how it was empowering women with its dominantly female cast. There are a few flaws here and there which is partly due to Boseman's sudden passing but as far as Phase 4 is concerned, we think that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a great closing film.Synopsis:
In Marvel Studios' ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,"" Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett), Shuri (Letitia Wright), M'Baku (Winston Duke), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and the Dora Milaje (including Florence Kasumba) fight to protect their nation from intervening world powers in the wake of King T'Challa's death."
9," Do you want to finish the business... like a Black Panther?
",shawnlu,/user/ur85561556/,15 November 2022,"Since the end of the Infinity Saga, recent MCU programs (movies + TVs) all came out a bit let down. Among those movies, Spider-man: No Way Home is definitely up there at the top. Thor 4 needed a little bit seriousness; Doctor Strange 2 felt like fragmented. In Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, director Ryan Coogler was able to pierce a series of events together seamlessly, keeping you engaged every scene. There might be plot holes spotted by some YouTubers who makes a living explaining movie. However, when the story itself keeps you engaged and going and going till the end credit, a couple of plot holes won't even be noticed by general audiences.The pain felt by the royal family, the desperation brought by the overpowered rivals, the purpose for Shuri to become the black panther, the choice she had to make till the end... The appearance of Kilmonger pushes the emotion of viewers to the peak and makes you worry about what will happen at the end.One of the best MCU instalments post Avengers: End Game."
9," Not sure what the cry babies are on about
",priyankashahdadpuri,/user/ur132686634/,15 November 2022,"""Wakanda Forever"" is MCU's 30-th movie and is phenomenal! The most powerful project of Phase 4. I can not understate how masterful the score is from start to finish. There are no weak links in the cast, but I have to give a special shoutout to Angela Basset and Letitia Wright's Shuri. Letitia is quite the beating heart of this film. And Tenoch Huerta? They couldn't have found a better Namor.""Ryan Coogler's emotional movies is about loss, legacy and healing. The story is intimate, but vast with global power struggles and palace intrigue. Tenoch Huerta's Namor is a force, better than I hoped. So much can be told...The scope, the camera work, the acting, and the raw emotions on and off screen can be felt throughout! Fantastic sequel and a great movie. I knew it'd be emotional and it was. Expect your eyes to leak.Immensely powerful story of forging forward-shattering at times, but also beautifully cathartic and heartening, still cannot get over how well the film earns that title.If Chadwick could see this movie, he'll be proud as much as I am right now!"
7," What Walt's Watching
",waltermwilliams,/user/ur65497206/,15 November 2022,"""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is the 30th film in Marvel Cinema Universe and a critical one for the continuing success of this sub-franchise.In this movie you can witness the live action debut of ""Prince Namor"" also know in Marvel comics to any middle aged person as The Sub-Mariner.When I was a child I loved reading comic books featuring this character.He was always a short fused Superhero not the Antihero we see in ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"".In this movie he's a hostile invader seeking vengeance for perceived wrongs that misguided surface-dwellers commuted against his kingdom.Sure he was never keen on us surface dwellers (ie people who live above the Oceans)
However Tenoch Huerta as ""Namor"" has got a balanced attitude because he's got a giant chip on each shoulder plus mutant abilities (including an Achilles heel literally).This dude can fly and breathe underwater and is one of the main reasons this North Queenslander took up diving and snorkelling as an aquatic hobby.In the past ""Namor"" has worked with the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, the X-Men and others, but they don't get a look in during this origins storyline leaving the door wide open to expand this chapter of the MCU.Just one question: What's with the water bombs?It was like a kids birthday party every time Namors people exploded one.What I liked about ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"": The wonderful minutes silence for the original ""Black Panther"" actor Chadwick Boseman who would have loved this movie no doubt.African-American Ryan Coogler returns to direct this sequel and felt right at home in the big chair again with a huge budget of hundreds of millions of greenbacks to play with.Rhianna even wrote a new hit song just for this movie, ""Lift Me Up"" plays during the closing titles.Watch out for: The costumes, sets, the pageantry, the fight scenes and the bonus revealing end credits plus a marvellous eye watering tribute to the memory of Boseman.Plus Angela Bassett delivers an academy award award winning speech and performance in her reprised role as as ""Queen Ramonda"".3.5/5*"
10," By far, one of the BEST marvel movies EVER!
",ellerought,/user/ur153372351/,15 November 2022,"This was a great movie, and it really showed a lot of grief and loss, but also the chance to learn and acknowledge the past while still moving on and living your best life in the present. It was very heartfelt, but also heart breaking. The CGI was amazing, it had beautiful scenes, with the dialogue and the screenplay, it was amazing, I have nothing but amazing things to say about it. I truly don't understand the mixed and low reviews of this beautiful film. There was amazing character growth, and you really had a deeper understanding of their grief. It was beautiful. It was a beautiful tribute to Chadwick who's memory was honored perfectly. I hope you enjoy the movie."
8," Solid
",searcherer,/user/ur68561822/,15 November 2022,"I watched this movie in IMAX 2D, and that I regret: I should've went for the IMAX 3D version. The visuals in this movie are a work of art, period. The tone for the different settings, complemented by the choice of actors for the characters, helped produce the right atmosphere and feel for the movie. The movie starts off interesting and continues so throughout that its long runtime is never a burden on viewers. The main characters are deep each in its own right and develop nicely as the events, yet still without the need for a shrink-level analysis or reading too much into them for them to be understandable and hence appreciated in context. Tenoch Huerta's performance really shined, I believe, and casting him for the role was spot-on. I enjoyed the showing so much I thought to myself I could watch it again and this time go for the IMAX 3D version - that one should prove a treat with this movie. Just don't forget to grab your popcorn and coke, it's a delightfully lengthy one!"

",atosa-llc,/user/ur35200820/,15 November 2022,"I went into this movie desperate to like it. I have seen every mcu property, and have been a big fan. I grew up with the comics, I know the lore, I love the history. Some of these stories helped me through my own struggles growing up. So again, when I went into this movie, I really wanted to like it!But.......Do you like falling asleep, but never actually falling asleep?Did you enjoy the long drawn out diplomacy scenes of Phantom Menace, on loop, with all action sequences removed?Then you would love the new Black Panther movie.Save yourself the time, money, heartache. Do not go see this movie. It adds nothing to the MCU, and makes OSHA Safety Training videos sound like a blockbuster.Everything was there for an AMAZING MOVIE - but instead, they created something that should have never seen the light of day. Similar to Spiderman 3 (Tobey Mcguire), they tried to cover to much ground, handle to many characters and new characters, and a way over complicated story.Wow..... just wow..."
9," Ryan did a great job directing the film
",sonyabguard-store,/user/ur19391124/,15 November 2022,"I felt that Ryan did an excellent job directing this film. The tribute was amazing, considering it was a second film. I will always like the costumes of Wakanda Forever. Although it was slow at first it truly was very close to the comics and this is what is important. If you have not read the comics, then it would not make sense to you. I did like the underwater scenes as well it was beautiful. I watched it in 3D so I did have a different effect than probably a regular movie goer as well. The fight scenes was like it was coming at you. I will miss Chadwick Boseman but he would be grateful for how they celebrated his life in this film."
2," Do not Bother
",Jan-Sikora,/user/ur100147799/,15 November 2022,"Almost three hours of pure boredom. Don't watch this movie if you are expecting something more than another Wonder Woman 1984 fiasco.The plot and the character's motivations make no sense. Namor is nothing that we as a comic readers were used to. Genocide of every single thing just because someone found their ore?Also. Wakanda does not care about anyone and won't waste their time nor resources on events that can destroy the planet or Universe, BUT when a random girl is in trouble. They will sacrifice their own people and kids when some orphan gets kidnapped.Oh and don't get me started on the way they decided to ""defeat"" Ocean Man (Namor).Marvel is going downhill. Which is not a surprise."
9," Finally, One of the Best Movies in Phase 4
",CutlasSaber,/user/ur156856433/,15 November 2022,"First of all let me start of this review by saying this movie was actually pretty good. With the tragic death of Chadwick Boseman, Coogler struggled to decide whether he should recast the character or rewrite the entire movie. Regardless of where I stand on this decision, I think Coogler did a fantastic job at executing this. With that being said, here are my thoughts on the movie itself;The visuals were surprisingly good. With Marvel's recent history on CGI effects not being so good (I'm also referring to that god-awful CGI fight at the final battle of Black Panther 1), so I'm happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised with how beautiful the visuals are, especially with how majestically they edited the usage of water in this film.Now while there are quiet a few action scenes in this movie (all of which are pretty neat) there aren't actually a lot, and I thought this was fine. This movie was long and didn't really waste too much of our time with filler. With the amount of characters shown in this film, development is what we needed to flesh out these characters. (I'd also like to mention that a lot of the characters that get a lot of screen time weren't as fleshed out as I wanted to be in the first movie, so it's good to see them be more than just side characters for once) This brings me to the main character of this film that made me really like this movie;Letitia Wright's performance as Shuri was definitely a high in this movie. Her character of having to cope with the death of her brother made me sympathetic towards her character, and her development throughout this film was really well-written.This was probably mentioned by almost everyone by now so I'll keep it brief, but I think it's worth mentioning. Angela Bassett's performance as Ramonda was by far one of the best performances in this film and completely stole the show.Alright now to some of the bad stuff: I thought the American subplots in this film were kind of unnecessary, Ross was relevant in the first movie and actually did important stuff, here Ross isn't really doing anything and his character in this film overall is a complete waste of time.I don't know if it was just me, but the post credit scene kind of bothered me a bit. I could rant on this all day, so I'm not even going to try. But basically my main complaint about this is how this cute scene about T'Challa's secret son raises a lot of questions, and when you think about him having a secret son in his older movies, it creates a lot of plot holes."
5," Wakanda goes on forever and ever and ever . . .
",garretsr,/user/ur0829023/,15 November 2022,"The film's biggest flaw is that it is just slow. The vast majority of the time is spent on dialogue that does nothing to move the plot forward. The dialogue is not funny, exciting, inciteful, or even memorable.The movie is almost three hours long, which is acceptable if it entertains, but the brief bits of entertainment get you nowhere. There are also cheesy references to indigineous peoples' culture that got more laughs than sympathy. For example when an elder shows up with a lip plate--even ignoring the fact that it is a male elder and lip plates are generally used by female tribe members --the caricature caused laughs and groans from the audience. If the character said anything important, nobody heard it because nobody took him seriously. I hope that the character was not intended as comic relief."
9," Who is the next Black Panther?
",timeblank,/user/ur85931294/,15 November 2022,"Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther was a huge loss to the world. This movie honored him and showed huge respect for his remembrance. What is next for the sequel to Black Panther? The movie focus on Shuri, Queen Ramonda, Okoye, and M'Baku. It focuses on their new path and introduce to a new bad guy, Namor, an underwater king with new technology and weapons. He wants to protect his resources and people from the surface dwellers. And threatens Wakanda on a brink of war. But my thoughts are who will be the next Black Panther? 2 hours and a half, we are introduced to the new Black Panther. It was great seeing the other side of the new side characters along with Namor's world underwater. But it's a bit annoying to wait for the new Black Panther to get screen time. We can mourn and we can be introduced but we are forgetting about the hero that Marvel made, Black Panther."
5," Better than the first but from Black vs Black to Black vs Brown
",ocacia,/user/ur4740983/,15 November 2022,"Wakanda forever was a deeper more emotive film than the first. It had way more nuance and better acting than the first. Beyond a shadow of a doubt if you put the two films side by side Wakanda is a more mature well developed film, less Marvel and in my mind that could only be a good thing.But it is still Marvel with a lot of silly stuff that does not appeal to me. Silly fight scenes, silly CGI. Actually if I was to take out the first 3 min and just start with the funeral and all those ridiculous fight scenes the film would be 8/10 based on character development, theme and how they handle Chads death. I read so many reviews prior to seeing it (and I was not going to see it) and none of the reviews were accurate. There were no issues with the exposure of the film, or anything else. And most of all I had no issue with the pace, it was not boring although a hair cut would have helped. It explored deeper political themes and minus that Iron Lady was okay. The music was not the best, I do not think the composer was the best. The costumes for Wakanda with the exception of the Queen were terrible. The costumes for the Mesoamericans were very nice.But on a political note it seems Wakanda will fight other oppressed Africans and now oppressed Brown people, everyone but a film where they just fight the real colonizers. That makes no sense, but it obviously has to be like that because the film is owned by White Americans and would be a flop if Wakanda had to fight America or france."
10," Just woow
",sofia-nk,/user/ur39067885/,15 November 2022,"Constant goosebumps, and was left speechless. Marvel, not only did it break more barriers that were recently put up by society, but it created a beautiful & amazing movie; one that shows the respect that Chadwick Boseman/T'Challa truly deserves. It's an amazing movie that doesn't ruin for a single second his legacy and the one he created for Black Panther, and it's story. Marvel and the cast of Black Panther truly found the perfect way to leave you mind blown, and teach you at the same time important life lessons like the power of healing. Congratulations to the whole cast & crew of this movie!!"

",him090296,/user/ur122315513/,15 November 2022,"Let me sing. Everyday I wake up, then I start to break up. Namor is the boy without love. ğŸ˜�
What I hate about 'Wakanda Forever' is the length. This movie was incredibly long and you really felt it. This is probably why it's hard to understand why people love this movie, above all else. The scenes and sequences that fill the running time were too boring for me. Instead, I want to focus on questions that no one seems to be asking. What are these Wakandan people? And before they do, Namor and Shuri talk about attacking the rest of the world first and act as if all nations will fall. Riri is here to prepare for her show. Things like Ross and Seinfeld chicks are only there to set up Thunderbolts."

6," Black Panther?
",jakesinnema,/user/ur150812614/,15 November 2022,"The acting in the film is very well done and Zuri has a quality arc that sees her mature as the film concludes. Would have liked to see her in the suit longer but the scenes with her reflecting on Chadwick never felt distasteful. Nothing wrong with Ironheart but her appearance did not feel a necessity to the story and the suit itself isn't what I think of when picturing a marvel style suit.The villain was pretty basic marvel, the backstory never gave his side too much depth or reason to be worried he would do harm to our main character. I love Watson(Martin Freeman) but some scenes his American accent feels rushed and unnatural which takes away from his scenes that already feel like they pulling us away from the story.For how long it drags its feet it surely wraps up the resolution in a bow for the audience and makes you question why there was such a fuss. Scenes in government buildings feel like a fever dream almost as bad as she-hulk where no one actually knows how to carry out diplomacy."
9," Film took on a near impossible task and did it with grace
",thomasduggins,/user/ur56407507/,15 November 2022,"I cannot speak highly enough to the overall fact that this film managed the difficult task of the loss of Chadwick/T'Challa in an honest and powerful manner while furthering the franchise and overall MCU.Huerta as Namor may be the richest MCU villain to date in terms of his performance and the breadth of the character.This portrayal of a family and nation's grief after the unexpected death of their leader is a testament to Coogler's ability as a writer and director. Honestly if he wants to tackle more in the MCU than Black Panther and Wakanda they should have him do anything he wants to. He clearly has a gift for storytelling, character development, and pacing out a movie.For a 2 hour and 40 minute movie it does not have any dead air and you do not feel as if anything drags.Not everything is perfect, but considering everything that had to be juggled the end result is a great achievement."
7," Good But Not Great.
",codyventura1,/user/ur57860367/,15 November 2022,"Black Panther 2 was good, but not great. What was good about the film was the introduction to new cities/landscapes, the new and unique character designs (particularly from Namor's people), and the battle scenes were also quite unique, especially the final battle. Namor was a memorable villain, with a fairly believable backstory, although not quite as good as Killmonger from the previous film.The movie's biggest weakness was the pacing, and some aspects of the movie felt a little too long. The movie would have benefitted from being 10-15 minutes shorter, and particularly if they cut out scenes which were not essential to the plot.In a nutshell, Black Panther 2 is a decent movie with good world-building, but struggles with poor pacing from time to time."

",samelia-26239,/user/ur154378887/,15 November 2022,"This movie was amazing for me, I thought they did a great job even without the amazing Chadwick Boseman, they hade a lot of fun scenes with amazing action sequences.It was a rollercoaster of emotions watching thru out the movie, it hade happiness and laughter, however It hade a lot of very sad scenes so be ready for an emotional experience.I thought the villian ""Namor"" was great, I enjoyed his powers and the purpose he had, great acting by Tenoch Huerta.The music they choose to play was absolutely sublime, very enjoyable songs with my favorit being named (Con La Brisa).I truly recommend this movie to literally anyone, a great sequal and an excellent tribute for our brother Chadwick Boseman, WAKANDA FOREVER ğŸ’™"
6," The wound of grief is still open in the Marvel Universe.
",eumesmozhoy,/user/ur157297919/,15 November 2022,"Grief is a wound that needs time to heal. In the case of Black Panther, it is explicit that the loss of Chadwick is, and tends to remain, an open wound with serious difficulties to heal.This second film in the saga presents the mourning and rebirth of the most interesting character in the current Marvel Universe.The richness of Black Panther continues: extraordinary scenarios, afro futurism, good action scenes and a great evolution in the special effects, but setbacks in the construction of the narrative.Weak plots take up much of the film, exposing Letitia Wright's difficulty in so suddenly assuming the leading role, making her a supporting character in a film that often seems to be about Namor, played by Tenoch Huerta.Unfortunately, Wakanda Forever's emotions point to a weak resolution, which doesn't exploit the story's dramatic potential.A wonderful, but not groundbreaking, blockbuster which will likely earn another Oscar nomination for Ruth E. Carter."
5," Typically Overlong
",RRiley9945,/user/ur8777413/,15 November 2022,"No longer do we have a super hero fight a villain. Pow! Bang! And that's it. It's more like suffering through a psychoanalysis session each movie. I do realize Marvel was famous for that but enough for awhile.And of course, the film goes on forever. No more 90 minutes these days It's hard to even find one that's two hours long. They. Go. On. Forever.I had a hard time understanding many of the characters. What I did get a kick out of was how in a few hours when you put two brainy young ladies together, they can assemble sophisticated armored suits just like Ironman has. Where do you go in Wakanda to get screws and nails much less a pack of cigarettes. I thought this was an isolated landlocked country but suddenly they now have waterways big enough to flow out battleship out to see.I am finding myself rambling here much like the movie I just watched."

And Also the action seen wasn't to bad, also was really cool to see Iron Man, The Predator and Avatar people make an appearance ğŸ˜‚ but this movie was just so boring, i don't watch Marvel movies to listen to a bunch of woman talk and talk about non sense now your probably thinking what non sense? Everything was nonsense and too political other then Chadwick passing away was just boring! And i was so happy when the queen died cause she was annoying too screaming and having outbrust wow great way of handling your kingdom! Sad to see marvel going downhill."
1," These is really bad that's why they say lower ur expectations
",natnaelsml,/user/ur158846966/,15 November 2022,"I personally don't like these movies an am sure these ain't gonna represent black people and African culture it's just full of weak male acteurs and over powered black women stuff ğŸ¤¢ stupid movie.Wakanda Forever"" is dark. As in, there are scenes where you can't see anything. The underwater sequences are a misfire. And, no, I won't be hearing the excuse that it's realistic for Talokan to be underlit because sunlight doesn't reach there, when there's a mutant with feathers on his ankles. So, I think we are way past realism at this point, and that should reflect in the cinematography with some unmotivated lighting to make the frames clear and visible! However, this problem isn't limited to the sea. Any scene on the surface is mostly ugly and textureless. Even when cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw and director Ryan Coogler manage to install some dynamic camerawork and creative staging into a scene, editors Kelley Dixon, Jennifer Lame, and Michael P. Shawver chop it up to hell. The action sequences are horrendous and weightless. The costume designs start off really well and then become gaudier and uglier (Okoye unintentionally addresses it as well). In addition to all that, the pacing is dreadful. Yes, Coogler is going for stillness and silence. However, since the writing is bad, that ""deliberate pacing"" starts to induce a headache. Ludwig GÃ¶ransson's score is probably one of the only positive elements of the film."
8," Solid entry into the MCU, especially as of late...
",alexandermarchack,/user/ur155724331/,15 November 2022,"A surprise to me, as I didn't specifically look forward to this movie as it did not have the late Chadwick Boseman in the leading role, but Marvel did a great job of being respectful to his passing, and honoring the legacy he had created with the character.In terms of themes it was a very layered movie, although a marvel movie it had a certain depth that recent projects haven't shown. Especially the focus on characters dealing with grief, and the rammifications of geopolitics, including both non and ficticious nations.Namor was an AMAZING villain, I dont care what anyone says judging his height or he wasn't super ripped or anything. The actor brought it, and you could tell he was an actual ANTI-hero, you could understand where he came from, and the reason behind his conclusion by the end of the movie. They have shown he is powerful, and not to be reckoned with.Shuri taking over as M/C was my only hesitation and I'm not fully on board yet, but she does act really well - but she had huge impossible shoes to fill.Overall a solid entry in the MCU and one of the better movies in Phase 4 (Spiderman is king of course though)."
6," 6 is high for this what marvel is doing with movies lately, just WHY? It's disrespectful to fans!
",capitanotm,/user/ur114459617/,15 November 2022,"Depth of the Namor's story is missing, again as in many new movies with villains or even heroes, I have not read comics, but I am sure they could have given more depth to his story background and more originality.As many movies lately the final fight is ridiculously short, there is no really twist or suspense, not really a fight, and all in all it is too much illogical. Wakanda is afraid of sea people? Like just build few hundreds of suits and been done with it.Some girl genius builds Iron Man kinda suit out of nothing?I guess when Marvel started MCU they had it pretty covered until End Game, and i believe they were surprised how well it went that they didn't really plan on much afterwards.And now they try to keep pace and make as much money as possible, just by hitting theaters with movies and TV with shows, with no really ideas. I don't think they don't want to make great movies and stories like before, I just think they are out of good quality ideas, and they are doing so many illogical stories counting that fans will watch because of the old hype.Movies became kids' stories with so much nonsense and there is so many lgbt and other promotions like feminism and black people rights.. And all of it has counter effect.. People hate to see that, those who respect others always will, those who don't will hate even more when they see so many promotions of this things in almost every movie nowadays.6/10 just because of memory to late Chadwick Boseman (that they could have done more emotional and beautiful, and for M. B. Jordan reappearing, at least for a minute.. Everything else it is just meh.. Sorry, it is just not nearly as good as marvel was.. I guess DC now has a very good chance to catch them and maybe overthrow them from the throne.. We'll see."
," Wakanda Surrender
",kenecharles-74648,/user/ur158846402/,15 November 2022,"Black panther wakanda forever is a great movie, a perfect blend between emotional and action packed.My critic though:
1. The story as to how T'challa died from illness doesn't cut it. T'challa is a super hero fortified with the power of the heart-shaped herb, he should not be susceptible to illnesses of any kind. Besides people who watch the movie in 10-15years time won't connect with the loss like we who lived through his(chadwick) death.2. I am yet to see an impressively populated wakandan army. A populated army like we have in movies where we can't see the end of the army. Wakanda is a country and not a village, I hope to see a battalion one day.3. Wakanda is supposed to be the most powerful nation on earth but they seems to have a knack for surrendering and always needing a last minute saviour.In Infinity War the were giving up before Thor arrived and saved the day/war.In Black Panther 1, at the final battle the dora milage had all been surrounded and about to surrender before M'baku arrived with the might of the Jabari tribe to their rescue.In wakanda forever, they had surrendered on the ship before shuri arrived with Namor to end the war. The most powerful country in the world should for once annihilate an enemy and not always claim to be the most powerful by words alone."

",nmoise79,/user/ur15786473/,15 November 2022,"I cannot believe some of the negative reviews. When is the last time you mourned during a superhero movie? Every time I saw Chadwick on screen I cried because it was so spooky that he actually passed away before being able to do the sequel. This sequel is about mourning and asking for the guidance and strength of your ancestors to move forward.As a black Haitian woman, I was sooooo moved that the heir to the throne of wakanda grew up in Haiti, especially the north part of the country with the historically charged name Toussaint.This movie got me overwhelmed by the mourning vibe, the call on ancestors, the acknowledgment of the mystical Haitian revolution and the portrayal of powerful black females! Wow, wow, wow!Ps: the only negative note, the battle between the natives and the black as the REAL enemy was elsewhere (U. N) and both camp knew it."

",MooRe96,/user/ur24392338/,15 November 2022,"As someone who enjoys a ""slow"" story where we can see the meaning behind the decisions characters made I really liked this movie. It's not something Marvel usually does and IMO that's great cuz we can see they are ready to step out of the comfort zone and make a movie that runs for almost 3h without it been packed with action for the whole runtime of the movie. Some people will not line this, but IMHO opinion, this is great cuz we can expect more serious story telling in films to come. I could say more but I don't want to spoil the movie and want people to read this cuz I saw many negative comments."

Wakanda Forever does this and There are no words that can describe the heartfelt sincerity that came from the cast when they spoke of their king. The MCU back story of Namor was a nice reimagined addition to the GODS story line that is being played out on D+ and in phase 4.

However, it's clearly not being used.If this is the mediocre way in which movies is going at the moment, cinema could be in real trouble. With such amazing story telling on streaming platforms, cinema needs to go the extra mile in every respect!To summarise, a dull, slow, weak and pointless, and quite frankly boring edition to the marvel universe, at the worst possible time for cinema.Start producing real quality again please, pull out all the stops, writing, producing, casting, effects, sound!Mediocre is not good enough."

I really liked the way wakanda and the inhabitants were showed in the movie, but I didn't really like the CGI for talokan and the water people. The big fight/war scenes weren't really exciting in my opinion. I did like Namor as a villain and the way he attacks looked cool. Still liked the movie, and would definitely rewatch as a Marvel fan.

While it is a spectacle for the big screen, it has slick action and music, the story deals with a serious subject and more than anything tugs hard at your heartstrings. The opening and end of the movie are simply beyond words... Thought I want to keep writing, the words are not enough to describe this gem of a movie. Get rid of your bias that a majority female cast cannot make a good movie and just go watch it in theaters.Wakanda Forever and ever... <3 <3 <3."
8," A Great Tribute to Chadwick Boseman
",alindsayal,/user/ur147091341/,14 November 2022,"After the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman, the future of the Black Panther franchise was up in the air but now we have Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees after the death of T'challa, Wakanda is at the mercy of other countries and a force which has chosen now to rise up.Main Character
Letitia Wright gets more of the centre stage as Shuri and her character has changed a plenty. Gone is the fun and charming teenager and in her place is this dark and brooding young woman who is clearly angry at the world. Considering the story the film is trying to tell it works and Wright does a really good job in her role and you clearly see a journey that she goes on in the film.Supporting Characters
Danai Gurira reprises her role as Okoye and she is really good, she is a really talented actress and her character gets some development here. She is good in the action sequences too with her filling this role as a warrior really well. Angela Basset gets a pretty substantial role as Queen Ramonda and this is the performance that most people have been talking about. She is fantastic in her role, you see the pain that comes from her after the events of the previous films and she does a great job in this royal role. Tenoch Huerta makes his debut as Namor and he is fantastic, even though he is technically the antagonist in this film his character is so well written and realised by Huerta that you can't help but kind of see his point of view on things and that is great to see. Dominique Thorne also makes her first appearance as Riri Williams, she is a lot of fun and her performance reminds me of what Shuri was like in the first Black Panther film and I think that was on purpose.Story
The story is incredibly heavy and emotional, it just feels real. The first act in particular feels like a true tribute to Chadwick Boseman and the character of T'Challa. But it also plays into the story and takes this group of broken people and makes them face this threat from a group of people who are also suffering. This is when the film is at its best, but it does have some issues. There is one part of the story that feels really out of place featuring a returning character that just feels shoehorned in. Also the last act had a few things that didn't quite sit well with me and let the film down a bit from a storytelling point of view.Script
The script is incredibly dramatic, this isn't your typical Marvel film and deals with the true consequences of grief and trauma. The jokes are alright but that isn't why we are here, the characters are well written and proper time is given for us to care.Style
The style of the film is a bit of a mixed bag. The soundtrack and overall sound design is really awesome and Ludwig Goransson continues his great streak of awesome music in film & TV. The film looks beautiful too, Wakanda & Talocan (Where Namor lives) are both very vibrant and nice to look out. But I don't know if it was just me who found the majority of the action scenes a bit jarring to watch, especially at the beginning of the film. There is plenty of shaky cam and it doesn't allow these performers to deliver as well as I think they can. Also the film does drag a bit, it is over 2 Hours & 30 Mins and I think a good 10/15 mins could have been cut off and the film would have been better.Overall
Overall, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a great film that feels like a real classy tribute to Chadwick Boseman but also tells its own story that resonated for me and I think it will any fan of this franchise.Overall - 8/10."
8," Moving Tribute to a Lost King; One of Marvel's Best in a While
",MackMonMay87,/user/ur7327870/,14 November 2022,"2018's Black Panther remains one of my favorite MCU entries despite some script and CGI shortcomings. The sudden passing of the tremendously talented and regal Chadwick Boseman was a celebrity death that hit me hard. As a lifelong Marvel fan since childhood, it was so exciting to see such perfect casting for a comic character who had the potential to become such a huge force of culture like Spider-Man or Batman. How does a franchise recover from the undeserved and untimely passing of a core cast member? We've seen this before with legends like Bruce&Brandon Lee, and the incredible Heath Ledger. Franchises like The Crow and the follow-up Nolan-Batman movie lacked the respective presence of those performers, so we've seen how tough it can be for a film series to come back from a loss like that.Wakanda Forever has to set up a whole new (overdue onscreen) character and civilization, build out a version of the Wakanda-corner of the MCU without the awesome lead, and simultaneously pay tribute to his passing. I went in expecting this to be one of the most uneven Marvel movies, and it would've been nobody's fault. Ryan Coogler and his team needs high praise, because WF accomplishes all of that and more, being one of the most solid Marvel entries in a long time, embodying the reasons why this series became what it is in the first place. It's a welcome refreshment after the unforgiveable war crime against good taste that was Thor: Fluff&Blunder.The women of Wakanda take the lead in this sequel, all of them amazingly handling the heavy task given to them. Shuri, Okoye, Queen Ramonda played to stunning perfection by Angela Bassett, newcomer Riri Williams and Nakia all shine brightly. Winston Duke makes a charming a charming return as M'Baku, adding layers to his comedic-relief character from the first. Of course speaking of the cast, we can't forget to leave out newcomer Tenoch Huerta, in an awesomely powerful performance as Namor The Sub-Mariner, one of Marvel's oldest founding characters who deserves the showcase he gets in WF. The MCU's choice to reinterpret Atlantis as Talocan, drawing from Meso-American mythological themes, is both beautiful and relevant to themes of the movie, while offering a spin on the character that separates him visually and culturally from rival Aquaman over at DC. Namor, as a true anti-hero just like the comics, makes one of the strongest impacts a character from Marvel has in a long time. Huerta makes him a convincingly (seemingly) unstoppable force of nature filled with rage and righteous anger, showing the understanding of the source material.Wakanda Forever clocks in at a long runtime, it has a lot of dense story to set up, and gets a lot of its emotional weight from the events of the previous movie, and also sometimes slows down with the inclusion of some political scenes that aren't as interesting as the growing conflict between Talocan and Wakanda, but when the movie is at it's best, its now one of Marvel's best. If you weren't as invested in the first installment, you might not find the stakes as high, this is a sequel in the truest sense that it relies on and is built on the story of the first, unlike some other MCU sequels that stand on their own despite previous entries. Wakanda Forever, and RIP to a true king in Chadwick Boseman. None of the impact, the emotion, the hype surrounding this part of the MCU would've been possible without him. It's a less interesting universe without him, but those left are honoring his memory in a way I have no doubt he's looking down upon favorably."
10," Almost got scammed
",brickscube,/user/ur58991894/,14 November 2022,"Almost didn't see this movie due to the reviews.Best marvel movie, even better than No way home.Best character development in a marvel movie.Best villain ever. Better than Thanos. More menacing and raises stakes.Most serious marvel movie. More serious than endgame.Best marvel character. Shuri is amazing. I didn't like her before but she's now my favourite character.Best action in a marvel movie. Not a cgi headache, actual good fight scenes with real stakes and depth.Best soundtrack ever. The theme when black panther shows up made me cry. So so so good.It really saddens me to see negative ratings, Every movie besides no way home and avengers has been mediocre and we finally have a stunningly perfect movie but no one can see it. Can't wait for future audiences to realize this was a severely underrated movie."
7," It's ok
",Mr_Wobbly,/user/ur27221135/,14 November 2022,"This was ok.It didn't do anything particularly new or interesting but moved the story along to where it needed to go.It dragged in places and felt a little bloated (check that runtime!) and the climatic battle scene of a bunch of people fighting a bunch of people is something we've seen before in the MCU... the Avatar trailer with blue people in water did not help.I liked Namor; he was changed from the comics but it didn't lose any of his petulance (and he kept the winger ankles and little green shorts) but when the film's best character was a man making gorilla noises you have to wonder why the heroine of the film didn't come across as more likeable.Still, it was entertaining enough and is a fun way to spend a couple of hours if you're an MCU fan."
9," An excellent sequel delivers the goods and then something new
",vinodralh,/user/ur72563686/,14 November 2022,"This movie stands proudly heads and shoulders above many recent Marvel movies. It has a maturity and emotional underpinning that we is often lacking in Marvel storytelling . One that we would dearly like to see more of, in our popcorn movie generation.A tremendously powerful ensemble cast, great script, quality special effects and a movie that delivers a satisfying ending with a hint of what's to come.The film delivers an honest, a touching and respectful honouring of Chadwick Boseman. It leaves his legacy intact and moves the movies forward, which was no simple task. Well done to the director for charting that course.It has some moments of cliche, but you can forgive those over the sheer delight of the overall film.Wakanda forever!"
6," Better than expected, but meh
",emiliolegorreta,/user/ur43388751/,14 November 2022,"I think it honestly helped that I had no expectations going in to it, especially when I found out the movie was nearly 3 hours long. I thought it had some great things to it, like the acting, Namor's introduction and background, the good but not overdone homage to Chadwick Boseman and Ironheart's MCU debut. To me it seems like the movie did a lot of the hard stuff well (villain, main plot, dealing with losing its protagonist and introducing new characters) but struggled with some of the things that Marvel usually gets right. It's overlong and unlike its predecessor I thought the movie was visually very bland and boring. There's no memorable scenes from a visual perspective and much of the action was done in a cookie-cutter way. I was especially dissapointed with Talokan's look, it should be pretty hard to make an ancient and powerful underwater empire look boring and bad but they sure as hell accomplished it. It seems like a lot of the more interesting plot points are left incomplete and feel forced at the end. I liked Shuri's struggle with embracing traditions and with facing her brother's death and how her character made us doubt if she was actually going to kill Namor. But was dissapointed when her final choice felt unjustified, like she did the ""honorable"" thing just because she's the good guy and not because she truly believed it was best. I give props to Mr. Coogler for a solid effort in what was an incredibly tall task."
7," Serviceable movie, but not Marvels best
",trevortrombley-73757,/user/ur99071898/,14 November 2022,"Wakanda forever is one of those movies which does everything well. But doesn't excel at anything in particular. The performances are good, the action is good, the vfx is good, but it's not Great.Riri Williams aka Iron heart felt tacked on and could have shaved off 20 minutes of run time. Shuri took a back seat in her own movie and didn't do much of anything until she became black panther.There's also Namor's motivations which weren't well thought out.Overall I'm growing tired of superhero films and the logic inherent in most of them. Tony Stark was special because he created a suit of armour that was unique to him, but now Riri, Shuri and just about anyone with a mechanical engineering degree can make iron man suits.Also if the heart shaped vibranium flower can give anyone the power of black panther why not feed it to an entire army so you are guaranteed to win? It's like when Thor imbued all those kids with the power of Thor.These plot holes are starting to become more evident the deeper we go down the MCU rabbit hole."
6," more on the way, of course
",ferguson-6,/user/ur0806494/,14 November 2022,"Greetings again from the darkness. The big secret was spoiled before the film ever hit theaters, and of course, I won't reveal anything here for those who have managed to avoid the leaks. We do learn the identity of the new Black Panther, complete with action sequences. What really stands out in this sequel to the 2018 original, is that writer-director Ryan Coogler and co-writer Joe Robert Cole return with less action, and more focus on grief, the transition of power, and the introduction of yet another society that has lived undetected for generations.The film opens with the death of King T'Challa from a mysterious illness. We see his mother, Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) and his sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) and the whole of Wakanda attending his funeral in a sea of white. Ms. Bassett kicks into dominant Queen Mother mode, while butting heads at times with Shuri in a collision of tradition vs. Science. A couple of sequences make sure we understand that Vibranium remains the most valuable and sought-after natural resource on the globe. Wakanda will stop at nothing to protect their way of life and their corner on the Vibranium market. However, it turns out, it's not a corner they control, but rather one they share with a previously unknown society.The CIA is involved ... in a botched mission of greed, of course ... and this means Agent Everett K Ross (Martin Freeman) continues his communication relationship with Wakanda, which drags the agency director and his ex-wife (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) into the fray. The story has many tentacles and bounces around the globe, mostly to appear complicated and important. Other familiar characters are back, including the fierce Okoye (Danai Gurira, a standout in the first film), M""Baku (Winston Duke, given little to do this time), and super spy Nakia (Lupita N'yongo) who now runs a school in Haiti.New to the proceedings are Dominique Thorne, who plays 19-year-old MIT science and technology whiz, Riri Williams, and especially Tenoch Huerta as Namor, the ruler of the underwater kingdom of Talokan. Not back are Daniel Kaluuya (scheduling conflicts?) and, of course, the late Chadwick Boseman, who passed away in 2020. Director Coogler includes a tribute to Boseman over the opening credits, and another near the film's end.The film is two hours and forty-one minutes long, and definitely drags at times. Still, the attempt at in-depth storytelling is commendable in the Marvel universe, though on a couple of occasions, the interjection of songs are distracting and recall 1980's filmmaking. The underwater segments look somewhat realistic rather than cartoonish, and the reveal of the new Black Panther probably won't surprise many - although the high-profile cameo might. Everything about the movie seems to set the stage for more sequels, all quite likely despite this one not reaching the unattainable level of the original.Opens wide in theaters beginning November 11, 2022."
8," Tribute and empowerment done tastefully
",jackgdemoss,/user/ur87808462/,14 November 2022,"Following up to a billion dollar plus film that had one of the strongest marketing campaigns in cinema history is no easy task. With the huge shoes that need to be filled in mind, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever really did do a great job. It still suffers from Marvel formulitis and the new trend of over explaining character motivations (i.e. Flash backs during the final standoff) which do cripple it a fair bit. Ultimately, it does the seemingly impossible of taking the tragic loss of Chadwick Boseman and building a compelling story around it without ever seeming like the movie exists to make a quick buck off of his passing.I feel like a broken record and even slightly mysoginistic whenever I say this, but I feel like it must be pointed out whenever possible: This is female empowerment done right. The lead actresses are fantastic and the characters they play are strong on their own terms without having to condescend constantly to men to prove their superiority. So many ""empowerment"" moments or whole films today focus soley on showing how the female protagonist is better than the guys, rather than just showing that she is awesome in general."
8," Very very good movie
",A_guy_who_watches_movies,/user/ur103768232/,14 November 2022,"This is my 2nd favorite phase 4 movie, and maybe top 10 marvel for me. It's very good. The music is great, the cgi is better than most phase 4 projects, the story is good, the villain is good, and the ending is adorable. I don't understand all the bad reviews. I can see why you might not like it and I can understand your opinion. But there's one thing that doesn't make sense to me. I keep reading reviews that are like it's no good without Chadwick. Not the same without Chadwick. Of course it's not. But what are you gonna do about it. Nothing. It'd be different if marvel had fired him. But Chadwick died, rest in peace. So you have to watch the movie for what it is. It makes me sad that you can't watch the movie for what it is and instead are just grumpy about it because someone who's dead isn't in it. Honestly it's disrespectful. It's a really good movie, an amazing tribute to Chadwick, very emotional, and one of the best of phase 4."
6," C-
",TheSmithySmith,/user/ur120101540/,14 November 2022,"What begins as a touching tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman quickly succumbs to an overstuffed plot that meanders and lacks direction. The movie's packed with unnecessary characters, subplots that go nowhere and are never mentioned again, and a woefully underdeveloped villain to compliment a woefully underdeveloped central conflict.2018's Black Panther succeeded on the merit of its electrifying character drama and how well that conflict tied into the central themes of the movie. It was a taught, masterfully assembled film that stood not only as one of the best ""superhero"" movies, but also an incredible achievement as a film overall. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever isn't that; it's just another Marvel movie, one that happens to serve as a disappointing follow-up to a genuinely amazing film and is all the worse off for it."
2," Relies on pulling heartstrings
",spaulagain,/user/ur80350849/,14 November 2022,"Entire film is dependent on getting at the emotions of the audience from losing Chadwick. Everything else is typical phase 4 garbage writing with nonsensical plot and boring characters. A villain that is easily defeated but takes a whole movie to do it, a child protegee, and an obnoxiously dumb super civilization really drag this film out to the point of torture.I just don't understand what is happening over at Marvel/Disney. After a decade of fantastic movies with only a few being B grade, it is astounding how consistently BAD phase 4 is.She Hulk and Wakanda are a perfect conclusion to this phase, dumb writing through and through. Other than Guardians 3, I'm done with the MCU. Complete waste of time."

7," The most mature and thoughtful MCU movie
",jaysonpajaronvistal,/user/ur158145467/,14 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever
Dir. Ryan Coogler
Rating: 7/10When I found out that Ryan Coogler had finished the script of this installment before Chadwick Boseman died, I respected him even more. I can't comprehend the struggle of rewriting the story because the protagonist, sadly, passed away. When you watched 'Wakanda Forever,' you can see that Coogler pays a loving tribute not just to T'Challa but to Chadwick too. The amount of respect and honor they showed to Chadwick in this movie translates to the audience. The opening scene alone is probably the most heartbreaking scene in the MCU franchise, and I love how they did not try to mask the death of Chadwick, instead, they opened the film with characters struggling with the loss of T'Challa that they did not expect and fully understand, and we can relate to that as an audience because his death was a shock for us as well. They did the best thing they could to address something so unfortunate.'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' tried to venture into the ""slow-burn"" genre where they take a deep dive into the characters' stories and it felt overstuffed. There are a lot of stories to follow up, and the constant flashbacks are jarring and overdone. It felt like spoon-feeding too much. Namor's story is explored very well, but I really did not connect with it. There are a lot of flashbacks and I never really felt the pain that the writer wanted me to feel, considering that Namor is being set up as the antagonist, it did not feel vital compared to Killmonger's story. The thing is, it was somehow addressed in the last part of the film, but it did not have that much depth to it.For me, it was the excellent performances that carried this movie throughout. Angela Bassett gave us an Oscar-worthy performance, she was terrific and heartbreaking. Lupita Nyong'o, as always, is phenomenal. But, Letitia Wright as Shuri, is a revelation. It is hard to fill in the shoes of Chadwick Boseman, but she did not do it in a way that is disrespectful to the character, she has done it on her own and she shines in this film.'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' is far from perfect, but they have served their purpose and Coogler has finished this film with flying colors despite the sudden changes in the writing after the death of Chadwick. This is a thoughtful and mature exploration of collaborative grief and loss. Also, 'Wakanda Forever' has better CGI effects than the first film. 'Wakanda Forever' tightens the impossible by paying tribute and giving emotional importance to the loss of the great, Chadwick Boseman, while confidently giving an unexpected path to the future of the franchise. The film is 2 hours and 41 minutes long, and it felt overstuffed and overloaded with stories, but 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' is MCU's most emotional and mature film."

Great cameo, excellent choice. Talocan city was beautiful. Movie more forward in a slow pace with a lot of goosebumps moments. It is a must theatre experience. But not much 3D visuals it could have been 2D. The character development of Shuri was well portrayed, Namor's character was also will return as an Anti Hero, hope he will appear in lot of future projects. Overall the movie was great virtual treat hope you guys love it."

",southdavid,/user/ur0715971/,14 November 2022,"Hmm.... I think maybe the problem is me. I need to stop going to see Marvel movies expecting them to change my life as when, like ""Wakanda Forever"", they're just fine, I come away feeling underwhelmed.With King T'Challa succumbing to a mystery illness, his younger sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) struggles with the guilt of being unable to save him. With no Black Panther to defend Wakanda, other countries take the opportunity to try and get their hands on Vibranium deposits. After Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) makes it clear that they will not be parting with any, the US discovers another source, deep in the Atlantic Ocean. Their discovery brings them into contact with an undersea Kingdom led by Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejia), an empire whose use of the mineral makes them a formidable opponent.One of ""Wakanda Forever's"" real problems also provides its most meaningful moments. It is a film about grief, and what people should take from it. The early funeral of King T'Challa, as well as seeing murals of Chadwick Boseman on buildings is genuinely moving - and that is not to even speak of the films one post credits scene. I can't imagine what it was like for the cast to film those various scenes. But it hurts the overall plot of the film. We've just done overwhelming grief with Wanda and it feels like a bit of a redux to do it again here. It's not the only failure of the plot too, Namor is a great character and it's interesting to see him and his world and its painfully obvious that this is going to be the last time they use him, which hamstrings the resolution of the film. I appreciate that a criticism of the MCU has been too reliant on comedy recently but here, for obvious tonal reasons, its desperately lacking.But it's not a bad film. The other great criticism of the MCU recently has been poor visual effects - that is certainly not the case here as Coogler has created another visually stunning film. It's probably lacking one major action scene, but the ones that are present are pretty good. It introduces or rejigs a number of characters that will pay into the MCU for the forthcoming years.I liked it and I thought it was good, but I want to love these films and I'm afraid that again, I couldn't quite get there."

",theffachrif,/user/ur147219942/,14 November 2022,"Directed by Ryan Coogler, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever tells about the people of Wakanda and their queen mourning the death of King T'Challa as they fight to protect their homeland from intervening world powers who try to take control of the Vibranium.MCU's Phase 4 has been a bumpy rollercoaster ride, most of the movie got a lot of mixed reviews. In my humble opinion, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever takes the number one spot in Phase 4 and closes it with a heart.You gotta give it to director Ryan Coogler for continuing the story richly and excellently, which is challenging. And yet he delivers a great tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman's character. Coogler successfully pulls the audience back into the world without losing its touch while also introducing us to a new one. This movie has better writing in recent years with the 2 hours and 41 minutes runtime, they utilize all the time available perfectly for telling the subplots and why it's connected to the central conflict. And surprisingly well-done character development.This movie is also packed with solid action.As for the performance go, Tenoch Huerta as Namor is impressive, he definitely deserves this role and I need to see more of him in MCU. Letitia Wright and Angela Basset's performances are the most powerful. The cinematography, score, production, and costume design are outstanding, I'm not surprised if this movie gets nominated for an Academy award.Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is Marvel's most powerful and emotional outing to date that didn't lose its touch from the beginning to end. It serves as one of if not the greatest sequels in the MCU."

",aramsdale,/user/ur54126942/,14 November 2022,"I really wanted to watch this to see how they would deal with the passing of Chadwick Boseman. I have to say, I thought they dealt with it perfectly.The opening scenes are so well done i have to congratulate them.The ending scenes were just as respectful in the way they honoured Chadwick.Now, for the rest of the film.We enjoyed it but would've enjoyed it more if it was 20 to 30 minutes shorter. It is nearly 3 hours long.We found the story a bit confusing & convoluted as there are a lot of characters introduced, with their side plots but it all seemed to work - kinda.Lots of action MCU action with some dodgy CGI but forgivable.We recommend watching it at cinema as it is a big movie.6/10."

",neil-476,/user/ur7813355/,14 November 2022,"Wakanda has just decided to become part of the wider world when T'Challa dies. When rapacious eyes turn on Wakanda's vibranium for military purposes, T'Challa's mother Queen Ramonda, stepping into the power vacuum, is like ""Yeah, dude, that won't be happening."" But the search for vibranium leads to a previously unknown undersea race and puts them at odds with Wakanda.I'm an old white bloke from a white background who lives in a predominantly white area and the previous film didn't have a lot to say to me (yes, I know I'm part of the problem). There seemed to me to be far more agenda than MCU. Thankfully, that imbalance has been reversed here, albeit some race agenda may have been replaced with some feminist agenda. However.There is some good stuff here. The approach to the untimely death of Chadwick Boseman and, by extension, T'Challa, is respectful and thoughtfully integrated into the plot. The treatment of grief is compassionate. The action and effects are well managed. The performances are excellent. And Namor is brought into the MCU. Most importantly of all, there is a lot of setup for future MCU projects, something which has not been obvious with much of Phase 4 so far.Then we get to the not-so-good. I had trouble with the generic MCU accent for African characters to the extent that I sometimes missed plot points. But, far more importantly, the conflict between Wakanda and Namor didn't make a whole lot of sense. Given what both nations wanted to achieve, either one of them attacking the other seemed to be the least effective way of achieving it. The story editors were asleep on the job.So this was an improvement on BP1, but most of Pase 4 has been better.I loved the closing sequence where Shuri finally faces her grief."

",chrisc-83456,/user/ur158827030/,14 November 2022,"Wasn't a big fan of the first film, thought it was HUGELY overrated. So went into this one with expectations that it would be just a little better than the awful Love and Thunder or the average Multiverse of madness.Well what i got was unexpected, an actual serious tone and very strong Marvel Film! It's been so long in a sea of Disney + tripe and bang average marathon of films, Chang Chi , Black Widow, Eternals, Thor etc etc etc.Firstly there's some Oscar quality stuff being shown by the heavyweights , Angela Basset and Lupita Nyongo show that they are levels above in this film having been criminally underused last time.Latisha wright also shows shes very talented now not relegated to light comic relief. Not watched Narcos Mexico but Tenoch Huerta also very impressive, again refreshing to have a proper antagonist rather than a paper thin villian.Much better grounded end battle thank Odin also, rather than just a messy CGI fight.The only thing that rankled me a little was Riri Willaims., not because i hate the character like a lot of the internet. Far from it, i always kinda liked someone being super inspired by Tony Stark and becoming IRON-HEART as tribute (though they kinda gave that role to spiderman in the MCU)Just in this film that aspect of Ironheart just doesn't exist, I know he's dead but he might aswell have never existed here also. Very quick almost unnoticeable mention that she is using stark tech but then never mentioned again, and Stark is not brought up again.Its the equivalent of Captain American Sam Wilson just turning up but never mentioning Steve, Maybe in her own likely poor to average Disney show.Ultimately i'd say you probably wont like this movie and give it a low score if you get upset/triggered by a handful of mentions that White Europeans Once colonized poorer nations and in this instance enslaved native South Americans OR want your Marvel films to have lots of trademark comedy or a Guardians of the Galaxy/IronMan?spiderman type lightness and fun.Its more on the side of ""Film"" rather than a ""Movie"" and if that sounds pretentious and dull then yes it may not be what you're after. Black Adam is available if you only want to engage in effects and action."
8," A subjective review - Black Panther: Wakanda Forever
",mainohis,/user/ur130763214/,14 November 2022,"My Subjective Review - Black Panther: Wakanda ForeverUltimately made as a major tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman, Black Panther is fully intentional with the grief it portrayed as it emitted this sincere aura on screen, resonating with the audience on his tragic passing. Director, Ryan Coogler had one job - to pay respects and eventually move the Black Panther franchise forward, a job which he did tremendously well.Although the introduction of a major powerhouse - Namor came with varying source material inaccuracies - as is the norm in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Tenoch Huerta did a spectacular job playing the Sub Mariner. One definitely gets swept away with his performance, waiting every moment to see just how powerful he is.The movie also Introduced the next kid in the block - Riri Williams AKA Ironheart. Immediately solidifying her as the genius she is. However, this is where there's a problem. Her character presence felt like it was used to further a film's narrative and while ordinarily, this is one of the essence of a character's presence, this was a bit flat. This also brings about the problem of Namor's motive - off and unjustified - it was modest at best but could have been done better. A fine introduction to the Ironheart character however as she makes her Disney+ series debut soon.Ryan welcomed us once again to the rich culture of Wakanda, pulled from many real life African culture whilst also introducing us to Talocan, an introduction that was done very well considering the little time we got to actually see Namor's Home - Talocan. Genius of them to imbue 'Maya' into the appearance of every Talocan we saw on screen. The very first thing I always look out for is the aesthetics of a film. Here comes the Meso American - YucatÃ¡n/Mayan inspiration taking it this time.Shuri's evolution into the Black Panther and her very well played emotional arc as she finds herself in a position she had always ran away from felt very fulfilling. She is motivated by loss and self realization thanks to a familiar face. Although, it would have been nice to see her handle the mantle of the Black Panther before delving right into battle, it was still decent.This review would not be complete without acknowledging the breathtaking performance of Angela Bassett. Single-handedly taking audience in a rollercoaster of emotions. She tells the story of a mother who has lost everything dear to her but cannot risk fretting or looking vulnerable to the outside world in a bid to protect her home. She tells the story of many mothers out there.The final showdown was underwhelming even though visually stunning as it left me wanting more. The 'is that all?' feeling.Overall, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever tells the story of Grief, Vengeance, Responsibility, and Unity. It's a literature classic of 'Beginning, Rising action, Climax, Falling action and End.' It isn't afraid of not being a typical Marvel movie given the circumstance. It also managed to tell a Black Panther story without T'Challa but with his imprints while doing a genius reincarnation at the end of the day, although this leaves a big question mark."

",tedlyles-85070,/user/ur91113488/,14 November 2022,"The void of Chadwick Boseman is too much to overcome. It was not a great movie, it was not a good movie, it was decent and the storyline didnt add up. I really wanted to like this movie but I didn't. The best part of this movie were the trailers that were released a few months before the movie. Namor's character dominated the show and his presence made it watchable. He had charm, leadership and the best for his people. His story deserves a movie more than anything. Maybe it was a rush job to complete this movie and rewriting an entire script on short notice had an effect on the outcome. Great wardrobe, pretty good special effects but all in all I was disappointed."

Bgm and songs just made the scenes even more better with the ladies fighting all around, screenplay could've been a bit better or else it was a rollercoaster for sure.Wakanda Forever!Miss you Boseman!"
1," Letitia Wright did NOT do the character justice
",projects-16267,/user/ur158824426/,14 November 2022,"I'll start with the good -- the overall film production and special effects were great, typical of a modern MCU film.HOWEVER, Letitia Wright, who is the main character was not able to sell it. She failed to carry me through the jouney her chacter was going through, which made the whole movie not believable. She lacked believability and overall star x-factor. She did well as a supporting cast in the original Black Panther movie, but she did not deliver as a main character in this supposed blockbuster MCU movie.Winston Duke as M'Baku was great and was the saving grace of the movie, but it was not nearly enough.There were attempts to incorporate some signature MCU witty / funny dialog, but they all fell short. For the witty dialog to work, you need to be invested in the identity of the characters."

",husseinsafar-54658,/user/ur147400455/,14 November 2022,"Really, it's a good movie. I've accepted Shuri the new black panther and Namor as a wonderful character who is neither white nor black he is a gray character. What a movie. Great acting from Tenoch, Letitia and Angela, great characters, great acting, but there are some flaws, such as not ending the secondary topic in the same movie to be used in the third part of the movie. Letitia's body doesn't feel like that of a superhero, so she has to work on some issues in the final scene. That's why I gave it a rating of 8 out of 10. This film is best than black Adam of course and a minute of Namor in the film is even better than all the scenes of Aquaman. I liked the film."

According to the movie, a 19 year old was the only person who had made a vibranium detector and people are hunting her for that. That girl built an iron man suit in a garage. Like WTH? Namor comes to queen Ramonda and says that he has a army larger in number than the grass in Wakanda and in the final battle scene, there weren't more than 200 people fighting?! The car and bike chase sequence was pretty good. The plan was to dehydrate Namor in the final battle. Shuri and Namor fight on a beach surrounded by water and you're telling me that Namor couldn't have gone to it and regained his energy or power?! IT WAS A DECENT WATCH."
8," The loss is felt in this one.
",Avwillfan89,/user/ur22066568/,14 November 2022,"The first five minutes and the last few minutes had me in tears. Both T'Challa and Chadwick Boseman are gone and there is a huge gap in both this film and the Marvel universe left by his passing. He really is sorely missed.This film kind of represents where Marvel is at at the moment: unsure of what to do because of core characters that have departed, and where the overall arc of the story is heading.It's portrayal of grief is spot on and I felt so bad for Shuri as she loses so much in this film. But the healing process is present in this film and I'm glad they handled the loss of T'Challa well.Namor was OK, but definitely not as good as Killmonger in in the first film in terms of antagonists.Okoye gets to shine in this film. While she is presented as an unflappable bad-ass warrior, whenever she fails at a mission, she turns into a heartbroken little girl, begging not to be punished.I did not care for Riri Williams. Her character is handled in a similar way that America Chavez is in Doctor Strange in The Multiverse of Madness, in that she is a teenager with a unique set of skills whose primary aim is being a driving plot device. But while I found America sympathetic and likeable, Riri came off slightly annoying and underdeveloped. I'm unsure if I'm going to watch her upcoming series Ironheart.Phase 4 has been so-so. While it's been described as being about grief and PTSD, it hasn't always lived up to its expectations. This film certainly tackles these issues well, but it's no Endgame. Then again I wouldn't expect it to be."
4," Filling the hole with secondary characters. Another America Chavez included in the mix.
",sadako11,/user/ur39905823/,14 November 2022,The absence of Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther is really felt in this. They try to fill his absence with a whole bunch of secondary characters none of which capable carrying the movie.None of these characters can carry the movie. Period. There was NO main character. NONE. All of them were secondary.----SPLOILERS----They added this Iron-Man wannabe character who is a plot device just like America Chavez was in the Dr. Strange movie. We don't know much about her and I frankly don't care. Namor's obsession for killing her make no sense. Destroy the factory that created it! Some company already build the machine so you gain nothing by killing its creator!The FBI agent subplot was a complete filler. It did not affected the movie as at all.The only positive thing was Namor and his people. I found this Namor's origin version very interesting.

I love every second in this movie, but my favorite scene which is definitely the best scene in the entire movie and it is the scene when Namor showed Shuri Talokan, the music, the beauty, the representation...everything about that scene was perfect I could talk about it for days and days. It made me cry at the begging, at the end, at the middle, I r made me laugh too I felt all kind of emotions I just love it so much. Thus is an Oscar winner show right there.

",CinemaSerf,/user/ur107065132/,14 November 2022,"Mourning the unexplained death of King ""T'Challa"", the tech-rich African nation of ""Wakanda"" returns Queen ""Ramonda"" (Angela Bassett) to the throne and she must stabilise the kingdom and try to help her daughter ""Shuri"" (Letitia Wright) deal with the loss of her much-loved brother. A fireside chat late one night doesn't quite go to plan though, when they are introduced to an interloper. ""Namor"" (Tenoch Huerta) arrives to ask their help to thwart the Americans who nave managed to design a machine that can trace vibranium, and this has put his hitherto unknown population of underwater, Mesoamerican, people at risk. Either they help him to track down the scientist who created this or there could be war. The Princess and her general head to Massachusetts where they track down a college student who is almost as much of a whizz-kid as ""Shuri"". The FBI are on soon their trail and skedaddle they must, straight into the arms of the waiting ""Talokan"" who take them to their beautiful watery homeland where we learn just how they evolved. Somewhat narked, the Queen wants her daughter back and that action sows the seeds for a conflict between the two nations that, well, you can guess the rest. Sadly, that's the problem here. Despite a really strong and vibrant performance from Wright and some very fine production values, there is precious little story here. It is far, far, too long to sustain the thin plot and the conflict engineered between the two races is flawed in more ways than an US Congressional election. The pace is really slow, the combat scenes could have been choreographed by Sir Matthew Bourne - or by a Wakandan cheerleader at their equivalent of the ""Superbowl"" - and the supporting characters aren't on screen long enough to give Miss Wright enough help to wade through the frequent tedium. I wasn't helped by Huerta's very thick accent which made his dialogue nigh-on impossible to comprehend at times and the denouement screamed sequel so loudly that I forgot that I'd long given up on any jeopardy at the end two hours ago. There is a bit of character tragedy, character loyalty and thankfully Martin Freeman's (""Ross"" - why does he need an American accent?) appears but sparingly as we go along but Marvel must stop taking the audience for granted. They have to realise that their gorgeous Avatar-esque visual effects and technical wizardry are not going to entertain us indefinitely if the stories continue to deliver so weakly. Great to look at, a few power-ballads from the soundtrack and Wright is certainly a stylish and classy star - otherwise, this is a film nobody will remember in two years time, I'll bet!"
8," Pretty solid follow up to Black Panther and a movie that honors Chadwick's legacy with the mantle
",lucaslw-93145,/user/ur100390004/,14 November 2022,"Pretty solid movie with a couple of blemishes. Strong overall story and a great introduction of Atlantis / Talokan.Namor in this movie is incredible. Compelling background, great abilities without feeling too strong, visually imposing fighting style, great aesthetic, and a great performance from Tenoch Huerta. Really, I think Namor goes toe to toe with Wen Wu for best phase 4 antagonist, and Huerta's performance here is top 3 phase 4 antagonist performances alongside Willem Dafoe and Tony Leung. The background for Namor's name is also very satisfying, and delivers a more interesting history than his comic-book history. An incredible addition by Ryan Coogler & team.The world building for Talokan is mesmerizing and the alternate take on a Mayan inspired Atlantis is one of the most creative & elegant remixes of the underwater kingdom I've seen.The Talokan side of the movie was jaw dropping and profoundly exciting. On the other side of things, we had Riri William's / Ironheart's first appearance in the MCU. She wasn't that great, the actress doesn't quite look the part (in many scenes she looks 40 rather than 20 and carries a scowl more frequently than not) and Riri isn't quite written up the way I'd expect to see from a protege genius. She carries with her an air of arrogance that reminds me of all the negatives Tony had. Tuned a little higher. When we see her again, I hope to see more of a Michael Morales attitude, but who knows, maybe I'm in the minority here.Ok, lastly the Wakandan side. Shuri is the main anchor on this front. She's set up as the successor to the queen and the next Black Panther. So it's important for her to be worthy of both mantles. Yet she's coming off a huge loss, and vengeance is on her mind. Coogler puts together a very flawless dynamic arc for Shuri in this movie and she really does earn her place as the next Panther. On a side note, I am curious how this turns out for Marvel IRL with Letitia Wright as the new face of the BP franchise. Feels like a loose cannon, but we'll see I suppose. Oh and then great reprisal from Michael B Jordan as Killmonger in the ancestral plane.And then lastly the bads. The main one is that many of the fight scenes were close up shots, fast cuts, and not really clear what was happening. While there were a select handful of very clear shot sequences, the majority of the action choreography fell apart in large scale conflicts or high powered fights. Secondly many of the characters in the movie had accents. Mostly understandable, but a few moments, like Namor conversing with Shuri for example, were difficult to follow and I wish the sound mixing, recording, or something was done differently there."
3," I don't get the hype...
",Devobow,/user/ur4096748/,14 November 2022,"Seriously, this film is nowhere close to Avengers: Infinity War. While I was hoping this film would continue the path of taking an interesting story line upwards, I was disappointed by the trite dialogue (I know, Marvel movies are known for this, but this was the worst case example) and lack of characters viewers want to see. Even if the idea was to introduce new characters in this film, who would you want to see again in a Marvel film on equal footing with Avengers: Infinity War? Zero. Just like in Infinity War, there was only brief cameos of the original Black Panther movie. The hype will be big for a few weeks, but certainly not remembered as one of Marvel's best."

",extraplay-61838,/user/ur132041895/,14 November 2022,"I liked it a lot
I am glad I saw it.I was scared because the MCU have had terrible sequels/prequals and I loved the first Black Panther, so was afraid that Wakanda Forever would disappoint, let's face it the MCU have had a truly inconsistent run of films. For instance, Dr. Strange 2, Black Widow and Eternals, and the ugly and pointless (Thor 4, which is easily the worst MCU movie so far).If this movie had been bad, it would not have got all the love on Twitter it deserves.If you're expecting Black Panther 2 to be like Black Panther 1, you might be disappointed. But I think Coogler's Wakanda Forever was a consistent narrative overall. Importantly, it's just a very good."
5," Underwhelming
",Siimonsays,/user/ur149986149/,14 November 2022,"I wouldn't go so far as to call this movie disappointing, but it was certainly another underwhelming entry to MCU's phase 4. Tenoch Huerta's Namor really saved this movie in my view, being the most compelling character and involved in the best action sequences. I really enjoyed his performance. Letitia Wright was also solid as Shuri and gave a better performance than I expected. Okoye and Ramonda were also commanding. However where things started to get weird and unnecessary was the introduction of Riri Williams. It was utterly distracting and the character felt undeserving...and honestly, not very likeable. The story overall was fine. But that's the problem problem. It was fine and nothing more. Has the MCU magic started to run out? Or is it just a wrong direction that needs quickly course correcting?"

",iwishihadabird,/user/ur118451636/,14 November 2022,"Ok, so I've seen every marvel/mcu movie released so far and they just aren't good anymore. They used to be funny and interesting but they're just not anymore, and this movie just feels empty and lightweight without Chadwick boseman, and Disney knew that, but they didn't care. Otherwise they would have done something like a spinoff series on Disney+. But anyway, the story was uncaptivating and forgettable, like I said it feels empty without Chadwick boseman, and the writing wasn't very interesting to me. I loved the first black panther and wanted to love this one, but the only part I really enjoyed was the music. It was absolutely incredible but not incredible enough to save the movie. Either way, not really worth the time, and the future of the mcu doesn't seem like it will be either."

I walked into it knowing very well that there was no way it could be better than its predecessor, but I truly hoped that it would, and be a turning point for Marvel, but I was still disappointed. The biggest con is that the length isn't justifiable. There is no reason for this film to be just shy of 20 minutes. Namor wasn't written well, and just wasn't a good antagonist. And the cinematography, Autumn Durald moved the camera in every scene just to show that it moves. It gave me a really bad headache and I almost puked in a harkins bathroom. I was excited for this film since it was announced, hoping that it could outshine its predecessors, even if I knew that it couldn't."

",demonblade-37792,/user/ur140486858/,14 November 2022,"The movie overall has a great performance of its acting, story, and the tribute to deceased Chadwick Boseman. May Chadwick Boseman Rest In Peace. This was a big challenge to the director, Ryan Coogler, of how he would overcome the sequel and he delivered it well. There are plenty of good introductions of characters such as the new Black Panther, Ironheart, and as well with the story of Namor and his tribe. Tenoch Huerta played Namor as the antagonist in Wakanda Forever pretty good as he imposed a threat to Wakanda and the people of it. Fun fact: Huerta did not know how to swim at all until he landed the gig as Namor so he had to learn how to swim for the movie. It was a great movie and would recommend it to watch it in theaters. For me at least, going to the theaters to watch it again for a second viewing very soon."

The acting was good, I loved the instrumental music, visually better and more enjoyable. I still would've recast it, but for what they chose to do it was done well. Namor was done well and I like the spotlight it gave on Ramonda. I think Ironheart was just thrown into the plot for the sake of the show that's coming up about her, for the sake of not having a 3-hour movie that whole part would be the part I'd cut. Overall an excellent way to cap off a mostly mediocre phase 4 of Marvel by throwing one last good movie into the mix. Can't wait for Ant-Man though!"

And those were the only good things I can say about this film.Everything else just doesn't work. Some of the creative decisions by Marvel were poorly executed. This film struggled to find its legs due in large part to the writing, which was all over the place when it should have been more focused. The characters themselves made dumb narrative decisions that completely undermined everything they were working towards. All in all, this was a tough watch made even tougher due to the real hurt surrounding Chadwick's actual passing.Phase 4 continues to be a letdown for the Marvel brand. Like many other films in this phase, this one also caves under the weight of its own hype."
6," Really long
",jeremiahmichael-31366,/user/ur150334509/,14 November 2022,"I had huge expectations for this movie. It had great acting, music, fight scenes and characters. But the movie was long and sometimes not engaging. The emotion and mourning for Tachalla was amazing, they really captured the emotion and sadness of not just losing the character, but the actor as well. But the first half was really not engaging and could have gone with losing a few scenes. Namor was a great villain and not killing him off was a fantastic choice. The post credits scene was great as well. I gave the movie a 6/10 because there were alot of great moments, but the first half was not engaging enough to peak my interest except for the scenes of mourning. The second half (going from the rescue of shuri from the cave and foward) was alot more engaging."
9," ðŸŽ‰""THEY CALL HIM KUKULKHAN!"" It's a Beautifully Made Movie, One of the Best Movies of 2022. ðŸŽ‰
",DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed,/user/ur114907932/,14 November 2022,"Yes I have some problems with the movie, but The Direction is Beautiful, its a Beautifully Well made movie, on top of that, the Score sky rockets 2 Scenes. The Scene with Mbaku arm wrestling Shuri and the End bit when Ku-Kul-Khan and Shuri are on top of the spaceship together and the music blows those scenes through the roof.Things that They should of Changed -1. Either Recasting Tchalla or Anointing another character like a Young Man to Become the New Black Panther would of worked far better than Shuri.2. Riri Williams shouldn't be in this film, the War between Wakanda and Talokan should of been through the means of somebody Trespassing, Stealing or Killing either the Talokans or Vice Versa the Wakandans. That should of sparked the Diplomatic Issues Between the 2.3. Mbaku and his Men should of played a much bigger role in this Movie.4. If not Recasting Tchalla, than have Tchalla die on screen through a battle with the Talokans early on in the movie. It would of been far better and far more emotional. Not just quickly Killing him of screen. It was so Flat because of that.5. The Angela Bassett thing shouldn't of happened Period.6. Make the Talokan Underwater more Visually Appealing, it looked far inferior to Aquamans Atlantis.Parts I Liked -1. That Scene when Shuri descends from the Spaceship and the Might of Mbaku walks Down to Meet Her, and do the Arm Wrestling Test and that Music Blows the Roof Off! The Admiration was So High. What a Scene that was!2. The Story and Diplomatic Issues Between Wakanda and Talokan were Great Ideas.3. Actor That Played Namor Had a Great Monologue and Performance. At first, I thought KU-KUL-KHAN didn't look intimidating, but then I realised, I don't think they were going for a Physically Gigantic and Imposing Namor, but rather they were going For an unassuming look but he was Stone Cold Killer, It actually Worked and I get that now on the Second Watch.4. Attuma looked Great in Battle.5. The Okoye battle on the Bridge was So Damn Good.6. The Backstory of Namor was Great7. The Score was Super Strong. Ludwig Gorranson Really Created a Powerful Score for this Movie.8. The Hypnosis Scene From The Talokans was a Great Scene, was Definitely another Highlight of the Movie.9. The Slow Motion Scenes were Great.10. Some of the Action Scenes were Good.Overall, For what it Actually Does, This is One of the Most well made Movies of 2022."
6," Pleasantly surprised
",fpyssel,/user/ur43542824/,14 November 2022,"I got to the cinema and I have already gotten the impression that the movie might not be as good from people around me. So I didn't really have high expectations going into this.The movie started off with a sadder tone as tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman, which also set the backdrop of the position Wakanda finds itself in. The situation escalates when a new power is revealed and this sets Shuri off on a heroes journey that I think this movie did better than their other female leads. Although the start is not a place I would have thought Shuri would have been emotionally considering how she was after her fathers death.There was some logical inconsistencies with the start of the plot but it was small enough for me to gloss over, especially since Marvel generally don't let you dwell on those type of things.A lot of the character arcs were satisfying and I did not feel the run time. I think this was of the stronger movies in a weak phase 4."
10," Best movie of the year
",fernandov-95903,/user/ur158814407/,14 November 2022,This is the best marvel movie of the year because. It is has the best Wakanda Forever moments. I would recommend if you wanna watch something with action and suspension. The movie has a lot of great moments like Blavk banther Vs Namor The suit was great. The plot is great in yucatan its a good movie it looks beautiful wakanda when it got flooded was really amazing how they got there Ironheart suit I was sad that Chadwick is still dead RIP And in the movie and the mom died she drowned in the wakanda attack. The movie was an overall 10/10 movie will at least will get one of the best movie of the year This is my review bye.
9," WAKANDA FOREVER
",isaackh-92893,/user/ur153251054/,14 November 2022,"Very very emotional, wholesome tribute to the last Chadwick Boseman. Long movie but deserves its runtime, Namor was incredible! Shuri was great, Letitia Wright did a phenomenal job. KILLMONGER!!! That was a surprise, and a ""oh wow!"" moment. Favourite Phase 4 MCU film, potentially favourite MCU film since Endgame. It steers clear of the multiverse, marvel has had so much of the multiverse lately, so it was very nice to get away from it. Amazing film that adds to not just the MCU but Chadwick Boseman's legacy as T'challa and Black Panther. Cannot wait for more, Namor had one of my favourite introductions as a character, really hope we get a spinoff entitled 'Namor'"
2," Probably one of the worst movie of the year!
",singh-dhananjai,/user/ur20350755/,14 November 2022,"Very slow, bad graphics, story looks like made as you go along, very weak screenplay and bad direction!I am movie buff and know a good movie when it's one. I don't give such low ratings generally but this totsally deserves 2/10... don't waste your time and money. Movie started with some good potential in the beginning with where black panther ended and I had high hopes but within 10 minutes, went into some random story line and very predictable plot. I won't go into details much and spoil but suggesting to skip this one. It just spoiled the high bar that 1st black panther movie set and not worth waiting for another one."
10," Loved Every Bit of the Movie!! Wakanda Forever!!
",antonyprabu-76208,/user/ur148829532/,14 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever!!! I heard too many negative reviews for this movie. Few were like, Fans were disappointed, too conversational, Not many action sequences and it goes on.. Well!! If you are someone who expects an out and out super hero movie with hard core action sequences with Damal Dumeel scenes out of nowhere then this movie is not for you!!! I loved every bit of what I watched on the screen.. It was about embracing pain when you have lost someone close to you, Not giving up with what's lost rather rebuilding a Kingdom with everything that's left with them. In today's world most of us are consumed by Vengeance. It's easy to harm someone who has caused us pain. You could be the strongest person in this world and you will have every valid person to Harm or even Kill the person standing in front of you for what he has done to you.. However, in spite of whatever he has done to you, if you have a heart to forgive him and give him another chance to realise his mistake.. that's where and when you become a better person and make this world a beautiful place for You and Others to live. It takes seconds to destroy something but it takes generations to build something. And these values shown by the characters is what made me fall in love with the movie. What a tribute to Chadwick Boseman King T'Challa . Can't wait for the next part. Prince T'Challa we're waiting for you!! Wakanda Forever!! Peace Forever!!"
8," Black Panther Lives!
",vibhus-17780,/user/ur81435868/,14 November 2022,"Black Panther Lives ! After some disappointing projects from Marvel ( Thor L & T , She Hulk , Ms. Marvel ) , finally they delivered a good content . Wakanda Forever story starts with off screen death of T'Challa , it was good they didn't recast the character after the great lose of Chadwick Boseman , they never failed to give him a tribute . Likewise in Blackpanther 1 , they explored the underwater world and Namor's backstory , main positive he was stronger than protagonist which made movie more intriguing . Characterisation for each character was good , especially queen Ramonda and Shuri's character arc was well designed . Marvel kinda humor was good and well balanced , nothing feels forced . Movie gave seat edge experience in action sequence , especially Dora Milaje were impressive . Technically , breathe taking visuals and production design . Except few places great CGI work . Drawback , storytelling was bit slowpaced . Overall a good tribute to T'Challa and Chadwick Boseman , and great show by Wakandan Women , filled with emotional and goosebumps moments .Black Panther Lives ! WAKANDA FOREVER !"
6," Not what I expected...
",Drawmort,/user/ur44965663/,14 November 2022,"I am conflicted with this film and with Marvel.Let's review the good first. There is a heartfelt tribute to T'Challa and obviously to the actor who played him. The emotions shown feel real and manage to move. The performances are good in this regard. Angela Bassett stands out above the rest.I'm not one to oppose the replacement of Atlantis by Talokan, as this gives another excellent excuse to show some content that derives from universal culture in gigantic products like the MCU movies. Namor is an excellent addition to the ranks of Marvel superheroes immediately showing how powerful he is and what he is capable of.The action sequences are entertaining, as Marvel has already accustomed us.The wardrobe is also something to value in this film. There is a great effort and meaning behind each of the suits, which successfully try to mix the different cultures with the new times full of technology. This makes an excellent contribution to character design.Now what I didn't like about the movie. The entire story feels too light and if you think about it, pretty ridiculous. Namor's motivations don't match his plans or his actions throughout the film. Marvel Studios again falls flat when writing and developing their villains. It all feels like a mere excuse for the characters to clash. There is nothing really of weight in the story, except for the death of T'Challa, which is also not well used, abusing the drama whenever they can.I liked Riri Williams' introduction, but not Ironheart's introduction. The story devoured her as a secondary character and was relegated to the background when in fact the beginning of the film gives her much more importance.The pacing of the movie is inconsistent. It's pretty monotonous until the action scenes, which are good, but short. Sometimes, there is too much information happening too fast without giving the opportunity to fully appreciate each sequence and each character involved.Finally, the effects are good, as expected, but something is wrong with the composition of the cities. Both Wakanda and Talokan have a contrast and color problem that prevents them from being fully appreciated.The final battle scenario also seems pretty bad to me.Overall, the movie is entertaining if you just want to have fun with fights and visuals, but I think it's about time Marvel got serious about their movies and realized that adults are also consuming superhero movies."
9," Incredible Tribute
",nats_321,/user/ur8330377/,14 November 2022,"Honestly, I don't understand the negativity, but I also didn't understand it with the first one. It has all the components of a great film. Very well thought out story, a very strong character arc, a fascinating and engaging villain, and an incredible cast. The highlight is the special effects, which are stronger than any Marvel film to date. Of course Chadwick Boseman is sadly missed, but that was outside of anyones control. Shuri's attempt to deal with her loss and grief, resonates with anyone who has lost a loved one. Her growth, and her decisions are both admirable and understandable. A triumphant return for Black Panther, and a formidable introduction for Namor. Wakanda remains strong and protected!"
8," The sun never sets in Wakanda, even under a new rule
",shaht-16429,/user/ur60360619/,13 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever tells the story of the Kingdom of Wakanda after the death of their King T'Challa. His mother Ramonda (Bassett) and his sister Shuri (Wright) grieve while trying to govern the kingdom effectively against outside threats ranging from general greed coming from surface nations wanting to find Vibranium and the submerged nation of Talokan who will do anything to protect their way of live. The leader of Talokan (Huerta) acts under the guise of self defense when his kingdom is breached by other surface world nations and will wage war on Wakanda unless they find the scientist responsible for the equipment used by the CIA.Putting the convoluted set up for the movie aside, this is a much more emotional ride for the MCU. Of course a large part of it comes from the tribute to Chadwick Boseman, and his portrayal of T'Challa will be missed but this allows the two Wakandan royals to give some of the most moving performances in the entire MCU. Bassett and Wright were given much more prominent roles in the film than in the first movie and they did not disappoint. I knew Bassett could deliver but I was initially worried that Wright's expanded role would not be effective because Shuri was a loveable breakout star that never had an emotional scene; but I was glad to be proven wrong.But of course this movie is not just gloom, in fact it is visually stunning especially the scenes in Talokan. And director Ryan Coogler proves he is still a thriving force behind the camera with beautifully choreographed action sequences that look like the characters know how to fight instead of just doing a dance. And while it is no where near as funny as the first movie, there are some scene stealing characters that lighten the mood, like Riri Williams (Thorne) and M'Baku (Duke), the former being a welcome addition to the world while the other makes the most of what little screen time he has. And the majority of fan favourites have returned like Okoye (Gurira), Nakia (Nyong'o), Chiot (Noah) and Ross (Freeman). However the expansion of the world makes it a little hard to give some characters well earned screen time and other characters may also lack character development.One of the biggest issues with the film is that it sets up a lot of great and impactful ideas and themes but just leaves them there. For example there are very clear parallels between the hidden Kingdom of Wakanda, and the hidden kingdom of Talokan. And both Namor and Shuri have been through similar trauma, not because of their kingdom's seclusion but because of the amount of loss they both underwent and how it turns someone into someone they're not. The themes of grief and mourning are explained well with Shuri's emotions manifesting throughout the movie, but Namor just seemed like that one kid who hated it when bullies entered his secret clubhouse without his permission. They had an opportunity to talk about the effects of colonialization and imperialism and how it would give rise to people like Namor, but just didn't.I do not want to compare this movie to the first one, mainly because I think it's unfair to Letitia Wright. But the themes of systemic racism and ambivalence of the heartland are so well represented in the character of Killmonger that the audience understood and sympathized with his upbringing. And while his actions were extreme and was very clearly the bad guy, they did not go ignored. The first Black Panther was impactful because the hero did not just settle for the status quo, T'Challa lost the moral high ground and decided to change Wakanda for the better, because of what Killmonger did. I was hoping we would get this level of nuance in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever since it was written and directed by the same man, but I don't know if he didn't because of Chadwick's death caused massive script re-writes or because he just didn't draw those lines for whatever reason. I do sympathize with the writing process, it's not easy to give people everything they were looking for, maybe I just expect more from Coogler. I don't expect the exploration of mature themes from movies like the Spiderman Home Trilogy or the Thor movies or even Black Widow, but Black Panther is different.In the end, Black Panther: Wakanda forever is one of the better installments of MCU's Phase Four. It has earned it's two hour and forty minute runtime. Ryan Coogler knows how to create visually stunning set pieces and emotionally coherent scenes, and those two things are actually improvements from the last movie. These is no shortage of likeable characters or funny moments but that is basically what we expect from a marvel movie. It is just an another marvel movie, if you were expecting another Best Picture Nominee, you might be disappointed. But if you were looking for a good end piece to the uneven quality of Phase Four, you'll be satisfied, and emotionally wrought."
8," A sequel that holds up against its predecessor, although it doesn't surpass it
",spidermonkeycoleman,/user/ur130303885/,13 November 2022,"Wakanda Forever was almost impossible to make right. Everything was perfect after the first Black Panther and then the movie lost its main star. How do you continue a franchise after that? Somehow, Ryan Coogler manages to do it.While its main plot is good, the story in the movie is one of the weaker aspects, particularly the first hour. It covers a lot of ground very fast and doesn't always do the best job of explaining how they got from one scene to the next.For example, in one scene Riri is arguing with Shuri and Okoye about going with them to Wakanda and the next second the three of them are at Riri's workshop so she can grab some things before she leaves with them. How did we get to that point? When did she agree? There's a couple spots like that in the first hour that jump around and it makes the movie a little harder to follow. However as I mentioned, after probably the first hour (whenever the car chase happens) I would say that issue went away.Other than this, the story was great. I love how it takes it's time to show both sides of the dilemma, showing both the views of Wakanda and Talocan so you can understand both the hero and the villian, if Namor can even be called that.Without spoiling it, they do one thing with Okoye's character in this movie that I wasn't fond of, but maybe I'll get wanted up to it in her future MCU projects.The characters are easily the strongest aspect here. Every main character has a story and a reason for being in the movie. Namor gets so much detail that I was honestly suprised by it. Shuri grows as a character more in 1 movie than we see a lot of MCU characters grow in 3. She's no longer stuck in the ""smart black girl"" trope (even though they kind of threw Riri into it) and becomes her own. Nakia and M'Baku don't have much growth in this movie, but you can still feel the impact their presence has in it.The CGI was a mixed bag of good and bad. Visually everything looked good, Talocan was stunning and Wakanda remains beautiful. However, Ironheart's 2nd armor never looked good and the green screen during Talocan's attack on Wakanda was very noticeable. Some of the new Black Panther's CGI was off as well, but I think that was mainly due to the actions she has to pull off are unrealistic to begin with. Regardless of this, more often than not the CGI looked good, and even when it didn't hold up the visuals still pulled it through.The music was fantastic. I usually hate movies using songs with actual lyrics as their soundtrack because 90% of the time it doesnt fit the scene it's in and drags the emotions down. However, I felt the songs used in Wakanda Forever actually lifted the scenes up. The score by Ludwig was perfection, implementing Mayan and African vibes in such a melodic way.The action scenes were somewhat disappointing. They were very choppy so you couldn't easily keep track of what you were seeing. I dont think they even give you 1 good look at Riri's 1st Ironheart armor.I especially loved the ending scene. It does something I wish more MCU films would do which is ending the movie with raw emotion. As the stylized credits were rolling I was feeling my sadness and it was great.Overall, Wakanda Forever isn't better than the first Black Panther, but it does more than enough to live up to its legacy, even if there are a few flaws along the way."
9," Great Marvel movie that is on par with the original
",Raptordog19,/user/ur128752897/,13 November 2022,"In my opinion, this movie was just as good as the first. It builds upon the nation of Wakanda in a great way. However, there were still some issues.The Good:
The score was absolutely fantastic. I think it was definitely the best part of the movie.The story was amazing. I can't go into it without giving away spoilers so I will just tell you that it is phenomenal.The costume design is phenomenal. The costume design in Marvel movies never fail to impress me and Wakanda Forever might have some of the best.The fight scenes were well acted and well choreographedThe Bad:
The run time was just a tad too longI wasn't a fan of the endingThe MIT girl annoyed me."
10," I enjoyed it
",GoodGracious,/user/ur19806806/,13 November 2022,Not every Marvel movie needs to be packed with loads of action for me to enjoy it.. and not everything needs to make sense in our world for this story to work.. it's a fictional comic.. I think it was a good tribute and an interesting story line.. of course it's going to be different with out Chadwick.. but Black Panther can't die with him.. I went in with no expectations.. I laughed.. I cried.. I was surprised.. there was no wow moment for me.: but I'm happy to see where this story line goes.. I would definitely go see it.. don't let people discourage you.. not everyone is going to be happy.. I think it's the best movie I've seen since we've been about to go back to the theaters.
2," Ridiculous plot holes and cheap contrivances to milk the franchise. Hurrible.
",JoeBobJones,/user/ur10095173/,13 November 2022,"Wakanda Forever was an exercise in tedious torture. I'm sorry, but a 19 year old built the worlds *only* vibranium detector - with no vibranium to test it on? And no one thought to copy it? Oh wait, she also built her very own Iron Man suit, which she ""spent my whole working life on"", in a huge warehouse in Cambridge, where real estate don't come cheaply. ""There's a whole YouTube page devoted just to my sightings!"" So for months, or years, she's been flying around like Stark, but it was the vibranium detector that got attention? She did these things because she was told she couldn't. God.Then we have bad plot device number 2: ancient Aztecs who are underwater dwelling super soldiers - about a dozen of whom swimming thousands of miles on whales take down Wakanda - because centuries ago a peyote tripping mystic swam 120 meters underwater to find the magic vibranium herb, and swim back to the surface. Or whatever. And for 600 years they live undetected like Sponge Bob until the Marvel franchise came calling as an excuse to revive the magic powers of the glowing Black Panther cocktail. ""How do you know if it will work?"" ""If it glows"". Bing! It glows.This whole movie stank, shamelessly dragging along the memory of Chadwick Boseman in a maudlin, lazy money grab, setting up more sequels with his hidden son. It lessens the entire Marvel universe, and replaces Thor: The Dark World as the worst of the MCU movie, which was at least fun. Skip it."

",tyzilla-02450,/user/ur147723433/,13 November 2022,Black Panther Wakanda Forever is not just your typical Marvel Movie but an experience anyone can watch and feel the emotion of regardless of knowing Much about the MCU. Everyone is In Grief and the movie takes its time with its 2hr and 41 min Runtime. Marvel did an amazing job on Namor the mesoamrercian decent that was implied was perfectly brought over. Shuri taking up the mantle of Black Panther might have felt a little rushed but was worth the wait in the end. Shuris journey and grief throughout the Film you feel. I don't want to spoil anything else because it's necessary to see this in theaters.
9," Could of been shortened, but still well done!
",evanhatt,/user/ur113356532/,13 November 2022,"This film was 2 hours and 40 minutes LONG. To be honest they could of shortened a good chunk of the film. Scenes would drag on to the point where I almost fell asleep. HOWEVER there are more pros than cons. The tribute of Chadwick Boseman was excellent, however I wish that the tribute could of been a bit longer. The action was very intense and fun to watch, it could of had a bit more action tho. Letitia Wright played an excellent role in the film, and did a magnificent job as Black Panther. You will definitely go through many emotions watching the film. I would definitely recommend the film, it's a must watch!!"
7," Different, but quality and emotional!
",SPZMaxinema,/user/ur132395489/,13 November 2022,"The director and Disney/Marvel had a hard job ahead of them when Chadwick Boseman died, and I think that this film was done the best it could've been done given the new direction they had to go in. While there were a couple action scenes I didn't like and while I liked the first one slightly better since there was more actual Black Panther in it and more excitement, I thought the music, acting, villain (aside from his ankles with wings), special effects, and emotional drama were done very well! It was also a pleasant surprise to see Michael B Jordan appear again in the spirit realm, even if it was brief. I also liked the mid-credit scene, which made it even more emotional and promising for the future for the next Black Panther film! In general, this movie was a nice tribute to Chadwick Boseman!(And a quick side point, it's BS that Shuri can now beat the Hulk according to the movie's logic since M'Baku said that the villain Namor is as strong as him and she beat Namor in the end.)"

There is a good mix of action, detail, amazing sets and quality acting.The richness of the storyline, the respectfulness of culture and the way they dealt with the bereavement of their friend Chadwick Boseman was deep and meaningful. The actresses where phenomenal and an inspiration to women of all nations everywhere.I can't wait to see the next movie and see what direction they take, I imagine movie 3 will be more action packed as there was a lot of important build up on this one.Only upset, i waited till the end of the credits but there was nothing there! Bucking the marvel trend."
6," It's a BAD movie inside a GOOD attempt. Honest review.
",panony-68080,/user/ur147461715/,13 November 2022,"So I have always been a fan of the beautiful Angela Basset and her role as the queen in mourning her son was EXCELLENT. Her scenes in whole were wonderful. But that is just about it. The movie was a complete waste of time with mediocre story and horrible costumes. We ALL miss Chadwick Boseman. He was and always will be the BLACK PANTHER. There is no other - he was the king! But in that is the problem because there is NO ONE left to carry the mantel. And no - Disney - Suri unfortunately is not the answer. Neither is transformer look a like version of ""not-an-Iron-man"" whatever her name was. I am sorry.I hope Disney reads this because it might help them fix the disaster slate of TV and movies, they have created post end-game.You CANNOT REPLACE the actors that helped build the MCU. YOU CANNOT. It will not work and you further alienate the fans that give you their hard earned money for each cinematic release. You must expand into new characters!!!Iron man is dead. Captain American is old. Black Panther passed away and so did Black Widow. Hawkeye is now retired and that is where it ends. You need to begin finding NEW CHARACTERS TO MOVE THE FRANCHISE FORWARD. OR BRING 1-2 of those actors back for one LAST 10 year arc. UP to you but those are your choices as these new actors CANNOT CARRY those roles. It is over. Time to move forward."
4," Weak plot weaker screenplay
",chandlar-78050,/user/ur67805853/,13 November 2022,"First a big tribute to Chadwick T'challa my king .. the story was not convincing to bring a war at climax nor none seems to be a protagonist and more convincingly the new black panther seems to be close to be considered as antagonist. Action sequences missing the real panther rather a confused meerkat biting it's own tail. The second nation revealed even in trailer with the vibranium resource was well made and well visualised just as aqua man. The elders in marvel always show wiser ones but here they are dumb as ever, and really makes the feel of missing Chadwick the most. Overall a disappointment when coming out of theatre and gives a feel never to think of the movie again and wouldn't even watch it again on OTT or television."
10," Long Live the King
",toseale,/user/ur155171094/,13 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever had me crying within the first 5 minutes. From beginning to end, there's so much raw emotion and power to every scene and word spoken. The comedy was also on point. While some characters needed some more screen time and background, they were still plenty fun, and the big characters all had breathtaking performances. There were so many unbelievable moments that sent spears through my heart, and others that had me grinning from excitement. Letitia Wright as Shuri was so powerful and emotional. Angela Basset as Ramonda had so much energy and strength. Tenoch Huerta as Namor had me so happy to finally see the character on the big screen. His delivery of the character and his action scenes were amazing. I also really didn't know how to feel about Iron Heart being included in the MCU, but I'm now very excited for future projects with Dominique Thorne. I also loved the soundtrack. Ryan Coogler has passed on Chadwick Boseman's legacy beautifully."

",xcjxsqtk,/user/ur158805862/,13 November 2022,"I have no problem watching a long movie but I was waiting and waiting for the climax then it ended. Maybe I was expecting too much. The fight scene is okay. I was ready to cry but that didn't happen as well.Shuri could have been killed after replicating the herb.Queen becomes the Black Panther. She meets her husband who inspired her to be strong despite how much life has taken from her.T'chala's son growing in Wakanda.Every adult Wakandan, except for the elders and Shuri, looked like they could have been the black panther - ripped and confident.They could either improved on the fight scene or played more with Tchalas death."
9," Good movie indeed.
",manikantadokku-06053,/user/ur66949713/,13 November 2022,"This movie is good, the music is very nice and a lot of creativity and research has taken place.Shown the highlight of Brother-sister relation emotions in an inspiring manner. Unfortunately, the story has been adjusted because of the missing hero. It would have been awesome if he is still here. Watch it guys. Few parts are boring, but you will love creative visuals, music, and women empowerment.The music could have been highlighted just like in the first part. Don't compare it with the first part, you will feel bored.I would recommend watching it because it highlights ancient Africa, central, and south American cultures and how they were wiped off by the Spanish, Portuguese, and others."

",A7medSalah,/user/ur80177773/,13 November 2022,"In a cinematic universe where half of all living beings have already died and come back to life, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever reminds us that losing one person can feel just as devastating. The death of T'Challa - and actor Chadwick Boseman - weighs heavy on Wakanda Forever, with the fictional nation struggling to replace both their monarch and their champion, and Marvel Studios deciding how to honor a man it was clearly ready to work with for years and years to come. Wakanda Forever is an effective, emotional farewell to T'Challa - a meditation on forging one's own future out of a painful past - but with a plot that has to introduce an entirely new nation and pave the way for a new wave of Marvel stories, it does struggle under the weight of all that expectation .Black Panther: Wakanda Forever wastes no time addressing Boseman's passing, with a chaotic and tense opening scene leaving Shuri (Letitia Wright) feeling responsible for her brother's death. The funeral procession that follows speaks to the incredibly fine line Wakanda Forever has to walk: even in their mourning, there's joyous dancing and celebration of what T'Challa brought to the nation, but Shuri's solemnity as she moves through holding T'Challa's Panther helmet is a strong reminder of the conflicting emotions she and the movie at large have to balance .I liked shuri's arc in this movie both her and namor are the two that carried the movie. Riri williams is a great addition to the movie and i cant't wait to see her in her own series iron heart. Talokan people were great too. Martin Freeman and another outstanding performance. Ludwig Goransson with another great score that diserves an oscar too.What i didn't like about this movie is its runtime and sometimes i felt lost in the middle. Namor motives were weak for me. Other than that well crafted movie by coogler.Coogler pulls off an incredible feat, despite some story stumbles, creating a superhero film that is emotionally affecting, politically and culturally urgent, and that pays loving tribute not just to T'Challa but Chadwick Boseman too."
2," Another MCU Disappointment
",elizabethjeanhampton,/user/ur153433235/,13 November 2022,"The loss of Chadwick Boseman for the latest MCU movie has proved to be a key factor in this movie's poor performance. The movie plods along with a definite lack of character development which is sorely needed for an MCU project. Likely editing the movie might have improved the flow and picked up the pace of the movie. What's upsetting is that a poorly written, slow moving, and boring flick that does poorly will keep a well written and produced MCU movie from being released in the future. There's a limited number of Superhero franchises that are being ruined by Hollywood producers and directors who can't bring an engaging, MCU authentic movie to the screen."
9," This movie has earned its top spot on the marvel ranking and in its phase 4 lineup.
",hamzaahussain-21076,/user/ur102845723/,13 November 2022,"Black panther wakanda forever is definitely as the cast has constantly said in their tv interview appearances is a love letter to Chadwick Boseman and what he constant brought to this role as t'challa and the black panther. The acting, cinematography, soundtrack and stylistic elements to this movie is phenomenal and has earned its top spot on the marvel ranking and in its phase 4 lineup. Marvel and Ryan coogler did a stellar job in putting this movie together and it shows in all aspects. However there are some things which I didn't think were expanded on or worth putting into the movieI'm gonna mention spoilers cause I can't not speak on them.The beginning scene was definitely necessary for us as an audience and fans of Chadwick and his onscreen character of t'challa to say goodbye to him for a final time. This part of the scene hit me hard and was one of the many times it made me tear up. It was beautiful and really interesting to see how wakanda somewhat celebrated his death and wearing white, showing how the cultures and traditions from real life are once again in BP2, this does call back to t'challa saying to Natasha in civil war 'in my culture death is not the end'. It was stunning and again so beautiful to see and we could 'bury' t'challa with them giving our final goodbye. The raw emotion from shuri and okoye hit me hard.The humour aspects and comedy overall was expected from a marvel movie and I thought personally sometimes in phase 4 it's been really cringey or not funny, but okoye being targeted by riri Williams shuri and m Baku and their own individual comedy moments really made me laugh and added some lighthearted humour to the movie, it was subtle but effective.Mbaku played by winston duke has been a staple in this second movie, I love how they have evolved his character into a serious hidden tribe leader to a front runner in asking council to shuri and queen ramonda, and after seeing him wanting to rule wakanda at the end of the movie it will be very interesting to see what he will do. (When namor punched him I really thought he died, fish man is really powerful I guess).Angela Bassett deserves some type of award (oscar) for her stunning powerful performance as queen ramonda. Her speech to the UN solidified her position as queen of wakanda and how they are a formidable force in the world, and after the kidnapping of shuri by the talocanians her anger and grief brought tears to my eyes after she stripped the title of general from okoye. You can see how the death of t'challa and how much she had to stand up to really impacted her, really moving and she performed the best from this film.Okoye Ayo and the Dora milaje once again blew my mind to how strong and powerful they are. The action and fighting scenes they were in were eye catching and kept me on my toes and my eyes glued to the screen it was amazing. Aneka played by Michaela coke was everything I expected She will soon establish herself as a forced in the acting community after her performance in BPWF and her show 'I may destroy you' and my personal favourite 'chewing gum' I was so excited to see her in BPWF and I left ecstatic. Also her and okoye as the midnight angels was so amazing got me my proper hyped.Riri Williams was placed so well in the movie, her comedy was funny and her similarities to Tony stark were evident which is understandable as her mentor and idol was stark. I'm excited to see how her part in wakanda impacts her in her own Disney plus show! Maybe we can get a zendaya and Jacob cameo.Tenoch Huerta is an actor I knew nothing about and after watching his performance, I'm eager to see him in future marvel movies. Namor is a formidable force who is both smart cunning and caring. It's very true that tenoch said namor is not a villian in this movie and I see him more of an anti hero. He wanted to protect his community from the outside world by any means necessary which shares similar beliefs with the wakandans. You can see him points from both sides so I right now can't say that what he did was a good or bad thing, which I think shows how well he was written. After his yeilding to shuri post fight, we know that he did it for a reason and has wakanda by their throat by the time the outside world comes for their vibranium I'm eager again to see what happens in the future.Letitia wright has played shuri amazingly in this film and her character arc is very interesting. From her introduction in black panther 1 she has been a side character who is smart funny and clearly loves her brother and wants to help his role as black panther. There is a clear bond between them both. Now coming to the wakanda forever, the start is evident that she holds this bond even closer to her heart, and Shuri turns to her technology as a way to grieve T'Challa. She holds her grief of his death and also the death of ramonda throughout the movie and is the primary source of her vengeance against namor.Shuri prays to the god bast for guidance. It's interesting that for someone who 'scoffs at tradition' as quoted by m'baku she's desperate for anyone to help her. The consequence of her rejecting the traditions, gods and elders of wakanda comes back to her, when she takes her herb and see's killmonger who says she took the herb for retribution ( which she says to namor himself in the heat chamber on her ship), her panic when she see's killmonger really threw me off as well as shuri herself and refuses to acknowledge how herself and N'Jadaka are very similar in their goals.The reintroduction to wakanda and the introduction to talokan were visually and culturally extraordinary. The country of wakanda has had its beauty established through phase 3 of the MCU and just solidifies how well it is designed and it was nice to explore more deeper in the cities, in scenes such as okoye visiting aneka to recruit her for the midnight angels, before the talokanians flooded wakanda and towards the end of the movie when the citizens went back home after staying in jabari lands. Talokan also was beautiful and full of ancient Mayan / YucatÃ¡n culture with a whole underwater mesoamerican civilisation. It was so interesting to learn from that and so sick marvel is including more and more minority group cultures.Overall the soundtrack and cinematography of BPWF has been moving, elegant and engaging. This movie must be awarded for it's visuals,camera work and CGI (minus part of the third act, which is evident in recent marvel projects). It was so beautiful to watch and I would compare some scenes and stills to that of marvel studios Eternals. The music was on par with BP1's soundtrack with Kendrick Lamar and rihanna came out of hiding and made the best songs for the film. Burna boy and stormzy fit well in the scenes where ironheart and shuri were working In the lab and the gorgeous song by foudeqush and the amazing ludwig goransson mesermised me and fully immersed me into the world of talokan.The mid credit scene showing us nakias and t'challa's son Toussaint/T'challa sets up the future of Chadwicks role as king t'challa so well, I think the recast was done well and I'm sure the boseman family had a part to play in the movieNotable things I liked in the movie:
The water bombs the Talokanil use are really cool, the slow mo's when they hit were amazing.The chase scene with shuri okoye and riri was so intense I was on the edge of my seat.The chants and phases sued by the characters like 'wakanda forever' 'lik'ik talokan', m'bakus chant when the elders all held onto shuri when she was introduced as the black panther, and phrases used by the Dora milajeThe way namor flies and attacks the ships shows how strong he isThe movie ending on shuri completing her mothers ritual and burning her funeral clothes at the end of her grieving period, she's healed from the time the movie started to the end.Okoyes jokes and quick remarksThe whole movieOkay some of the I didn't like:
cgi fell apart in the third act, which isn't a surprise and something I wish didn't happen (cause K. E. V. I. N in she-hulk said the cgi department was focusing on BPWF)The side plot with Valentina and Ross was not needed in this movie at all and could've been cut out, it was there I think to setup future projects but I'm also happy that Ross was here but I wished he played a better role in the movie, maybe being in wakanda. He had a part to play in BP 1The lack of time on the emotional scenes, for example okoye and nakia's talk about t'challa was cut so short cause of the incoming attack on wakanda I wish they went more into it."
1," A depressing end to a disappointing Phase 4
",basementbrotherscollectibles,/user/ur142280227/,13 November 2022,"Wakanda Forever did not work for me for a few reasons...1) It was too long...2 hours and 41 minutes 2) It was depressing bc it felt more like a funeral for Chadwick Boseman than a superhero film. While I liked Chadwick as BP and will miss him, this film as a grief processor for the director, cast, and audience was a real downer 3) They should've recast T'Challa to continue the franchise. Again, BP is bigger than Chadwick. He and his family wanted the character to continue after him. 4) Shuri, Akoye, and especially RiRi couldn't carry the film for me. The Ironheart armor looked awful. 5) Namor's story and characterization was a huge letdown for comic fans. It was clumsy and done to get around rights issues with other studios, not to promote diversity like Disney claims. 6) Typical Phase 4 MCU problems...if you know what they are, then you know..."
7," Bummer...
",erinmarieperson,/user/ur113686380/,13 November 2022,"Based on the trailers, I was expecting an epic black panther. This isn't that. The runtime is too long by an hour at least. I was most disappointed by the fact that the black panther doesn't even show up until 2 hrs into the movie. Wasn't this a black panther movie?! ðŸ¤” I was expecting this cool transition to Shuri as the black panther but that was not the focus. The plot felt very manufactured. Lots of added elements that were out there and not believable. It just didn't even feel like a black panther movie they shoved so much else into it. And while the ending tribute is beautiful, the cut scene felt gratuitous."
7," Another movie that is just mid
",jay632,/user/ur4783913/,13 November 2022,"The pacing of the movie wasn't good. Some of the scenes and plot moved way too slow. The villian story moved slowed and was boring. This movie was a tribute to chadwick bosman. A lot of sadness in a couple of scenes in the movie. Parts i didn't like is they shoehorned in riri williams. Honestly, she wasn't needed. It always bothers me that instead of focusing on the movie itself, its trying to introduce another character so that she can be on disney plus, which i don't care for at all. Also the lack of strong male figures in this movie bother me, the ones that are in it are comedy goofs. The cgi and some fight scenes were cool, the underwater cgi was not."
10," Simply Amazing!!! MUST SEE!!!!!
",supermariobro05,/user/ur25274107/,13 November 2022,"Black Panther Wakanda Forever was a simply amazing picture/movie it gives you everything that a movie should from sadness and tears to laugher and joy with some amazing surprises. Which also giving us fans the type of closer we needed with the passing of Chadwick Boseman. With Chadwick's passing it changes the direction the film would've gone if he'd lived and the way Director Bryan Coogler vision was with this story line is fitting and also courageous because he got the blessing of Chadwick's wife and family to do this film the way he did, this is a must see movie. WAKANDA FOREVER!!!! RIP King T'Challa."
9," Great movie! Introduced new stuff and great acrion
",kevinwilliamshawaii,/user/ur114506833/,13 November 2022,"Amazing movie! IMDB rating is kinda low, I believe this movie deserved at least an 8.3 or more. Black panther definitely did not disappoint me, from start to finish of the movie it was amazing. The action was great, the story great, and they even introduced a lot of new stuff and characters. Great job Marvel! With all that said the acting in the movie was great too. I definitely recommend seeing this movie. The only bad thing to me was at the end they didn't add the second preview after the credits ended. Not a huge deal but that was the only bad thing about the movie I could say. I believe this movie deserves at least a 8.3 or more."
6," Tribute Worked but not the movie!
",giridharsivakoti,/user/ur77330810/,13 November 2022,"The movie addresses well what the characters are going through after T'challa's loss, and the acting is on point during those scenes.Keeping those scenes aside, the battle between Wakanda and Talhokan isn't great. Even the writing is off at times as you cannot take a side between Talhokan or Wakanda as both of them are victims in their own way. As a result, it's difficult to empathise with or cheer for one group, resulting in the disconnect.Technically, the movie hits more than it misses, be it the background score or the costumes or the art settings, everything is either decent or brilliant. We do have an interesting post credit scene that serves as a nice build-up for the next part.It could have been better than the first if the runtime had been reduced and there was more emotional connection in the story."
3," Great Villain wasted on a Bad hero.
",sor-49865,/user/ur130266465/,13 November 2022,"This movie is bad on so many angles, I cant even count how many times have to yawn in the theatre.First of all, i have to say the movie has a lot of potential. Namor is awesome, great actor, great motivation for a villain. The Sea people is unique and intimidating. War between super advanced world? Yes! A goodbye movie like what Fast and Furious done for Paul Walker? Absolutely.But in the end, the movie fell flat. Too much talking and still I can not feel the motivation for the hero.The movie displays a story about conflict between nations. But, how the media acts, how a winner of a conflict acts, how logic of war should be, all is done wrong. Albeitedly, this is fictional, but it is still hard to emerge yourself in so much false info.Lastly, the fight scene between 2 mains is EXTREMELY Lacking. The first Black Panther has the same problem but this is the whole new level.In the end, 3 stars. The only reason it is not 1 star is because of Namor."
9," A beautiful tribute to the wonderful Chadwick Boseman
",maksimwagner,/user/ur136076455/,13 November 2022,"Wow, just Wow... This movie really pulls on your emotions. It's an amazing movie and a good finale for the MCUs Phase 4. Yes, it has, like most of the movies of Phase 4, a few flaws, for example at some points nothing really happens, the 2nd Act is mostly used to build up the Finale of the movie, but it's easy to surpass this flaw, since the movie is visually stunning. Not a single shot looks bad and the underwater scenes for Talokan just make me excited for the next Avatar movie. Speaking of Talokan, this movie perfectly sets up the nation of Talokan and I can't wait to see more of it in the future. Namor, a character I already was familiar with, because I read the comics that inspired this movie, was depicted wonderfully and he really is just bad ass. He is really dangerous and powerful and you see it in his first attack on Wakanda. Now I want to talk about wakanda itself. There is a reason why this movie is called Wakanda Forever. This movie isn't about Black Panther it is about the mourning of the sudden death of him and how Wakanda copes with the loss. And you really feel it everyone is at the top of their game, Angela Bassett gives an amazing Oscar worthy performance and Letitia Wright is the core of emotions. Yes it has the tipical Marvel jokes but finally the comedy is balanced perfectly with the drama in this movie. All in all I think this movie is amazing and its for sure the best of Phase4."
," Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Rules with a $330 Million Global Launch, $180 Million Domestic Debut
",BudoSenpai,/user/ur23807550/,13 November 2022,"The sequel demolished the record for a November opening in the United States. This is a new type of Marvel Cinematic University (MCU) superhero movie that's here to stay. This was an outstanding tribute to the late great Chadwick Boseman, he would have been proud. We miss you brother!I truly enjoyed this movie and will add it to my collection; I definitely need to watch it over and over again. Everyone did a magnificent job, and the costumes were amazing as usual. Angela Bassett and Letitia Wright were awesome; we need more Black Superheroes. Looking forward to the trilogy; bring it on. Wakanda Forever!"
7," Decent idea however...
",davidingemannnimskov,/user/ur158092139/,13 November 2022,"I do actually Think that killing different people and such was good for the movie but i cant help but feel that Shuri seemed to be a very unexperienced fighter unlike Chadwick (May he rest in peace) who always mastered his abilities. I May just have High standards when it comes to Black Panther probably because he was an absolute badass in both Civil war and the first Black Panther movie. Overall: nice story with people dying, great to see ironheart, nice to see how Much Okoye wants to serve her country, also great callbacks with killmonger and the ""vengeance has comsumed Them im done letting it consume me"" but imo a lack of cool fight scenes and a truly loveable villain. Now ill Watch BP 1 for some awesomeness."

Did I enjoy myself? Yeah, for the most part. I also appreciated what this film did in terms of cultural representation on another level, and looking at lingering impact of colonization from 2 different, yet shared perspectives.Now... did the film give that same hype and feeling as the first? No, it didn't for me.Depending on how you look at this film, you could walk away with 1 of 2 feelings: 1. If you see this as a sequel, it might feel a little underwhelming, but better than what you'd expect from a sequel; or 2. If you see this as an/another origin, it might actually feel pretty good and exciting (though oddly placed due to the death of Chadwick Boseman, but good nonetheless).Personally, I think not having a ""true villain"" in a superhero story is what slows this film down a bit for me. It's like watching these 2 genuinely good middle schoolers who are never in any dramas suddenly in the middle of a circle arguing/trying/being forced to fight in the cafeteria with no personal desires to want or need to fight, but have been somehow instigated to do so by a bully standing on the side VS seeing these 2 good people band together against the bully.OTHER THOUGHTS:
Highlights: The underwater visuals, the Talokanils, the opening scene at the UN, Angela Bassett's monologue, Toussaint, the ""water at the window"" scene, that LGBTQ representation, cultural representation, thematic followthrough, and Marvel Studios opening for Chadwick Boseman.Could've Been Better: The Black Panther suit, the conflict/tension, a villain, a little more background to Riri's character (to the point that I need her to have a Disney series to fill in some gaps), and the title (I remember when Michael Jackson came out with Invincible, and there was an article or conversation on TV about how naming projects in ways that can come off arrogant or too bold can lead to distaste)."
7," The score !!!
",eoinpgeary,/user/ur89122372/,13 November 2022,"Firstly I have to mention what stood out most for me, that's the score, multiple times in the movie I got goosebumps and emotional from the music alone !The story itself as we know is one of pain and suffering but most importantly acceptance. All of the acting was top notch and it was visually great, I'm not sure was it my cinema or the movie but many shots were out of focus hurting my eyes a little.There is not loads of action but it doesn't feel like the movie needs loads, it's a character driven story and it does it quite well.Many things happen that I was truly shocked about, my stand out character's are Okoye, Shuri, Namor.The movie started FANTASTIC, I got winter solider vibes but it did slowly fade from that tone. All of the suits are a bit much, iron heart I wasn't too keen on even Okoye later on, without spoilers the style did bother me.The ending did bother me a lot, it lost many marks in my opinion for the movie, I feel like with the outcome everything could have been avoided over an hour into the movie, not impressed but I don't want that to take away from how good the start and middle are, it's a solid movie, a good sequel and I can see myself watching it again just not too soon."
8," A Good Movie, but with Errors.
",matheusgarces,/user/ur157713563/,13 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a good movie and above all a great tribute. The film surprises with great footage and a great villain. Namor is introduced in this film, he is a villain that suits the protagonist very much. His motivations are OK (nothing like Thanos' motivations in Infinity War). For our protagonist we have Shuri interpreted by Letitia Wright. Unfortunately for Chadwick Boseman's death, Letitia is put in place. By the exchange the film becomes of origin and a little confused in this matter. Shuri will never be better than King T'Challa.In conclusion, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a good movie but the confusion and lack of Chadwick make the movie worse. One of the best films of phase four."
3," A huge let-down that I wasn't expect
",baocam-47926,/user/ur158797670/,13 November 2022,"This movie is a hit in my face. I had high expectations for this movie since the first Black Panther movie is well executed and I thought they will put a lot of effort in this second part as a tribute to actor Chadwick Boseman. But man I was so wrong. This is the type of blockbuster that have huge budget but disappointing main leads and horrible direction. This feels like a teenfic movie where the characters are so one dimensional and have little to no characters development. Letitia is a potential actress but she lack acting skill to carry the whole movie. All the characters are so theatrical I thought I was watching some soap opera. This movie need some serious adjustments for script writing. Also, the suit designs are such a disgrace to the black panther movie. Why turn one of the most beautiful superhero suit into colorful alienated fishman costumes. What a joke."
4," A disappointing movie yet a good tribute
",nucleyaprime,/user/ur125973533/,13 November 2022,This movie was as stated in most reviews slow which loosely means there was nothing iconic in this movie like in endgame when cap lifted thor's hammer or in infinity war when thor arrived in wakanda but i cant be that harsh on the movie because it is what marvel was forced to do i dont think they had a choice on what they could show to make the movie better without it being disrespectful to Chadwick this movie wasnt kept in mind to make money just to set the stage for future movies and generations so that Marvel cinematic universe wont die because of plot holes about where black panther or other charecters are i believe it could have better reviews if the scenes in the ocean and sea weren't so dark as Aquaman just did the whole movie in water better with namor's charecter feeling a weak imitation and not much charecter depth other than the fact he saw some random people being enslaved got mad decided i am gonna kill everyone (i dont mean to be disrespectful to people who's ancestors were enslaved but there is no personal connection that namor had that convinced namor that all humans were bad due to one bad side of humans).
8," Surprisingly a great film in my opinion
",adamlawlor-99228,/user/ur153977627/,13 November 2022,"Yesterday I sawed Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) in cinema, and this is what I thought of it.Now my positives of the film would be that a lot characters became more real table with me such as Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira etc, because they were also shock about the death of Chadwick Boseman. I thought the effects were a whole lot better than the first one, and I did enjoy the fight scenes a little bit more. Lastly the negatives of the film for me would be that, I didn't get invested into the villain as I did with Michael B. Jordan, and I felt the soundtrack wasn't as great as the first film. So after all my positives and negatives, I would give Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) and 8.2 out of ten."

I like ryan coogler work in this movie. Bit i don't like shuri's black panther because she can't replace Chadwick Boseman's. Black panther she looks weak in front of namor . I liked all actors performance. And sound and background music is perfect and graphics and CGI is so beautiful. I recommend you to watch this movie.

Black Panther was not possible without Chodwick but Marvel made this movie the best feeling for the audience in their own way. The VFX thor love and thunder was very flawed if i liked the most in this movie but they have used the best of VFX in black panther wakanda forever. Just like Spider-Man's entry in Captain America, in Wakanda Forever, the entry of Iron Man's female version is shown as the best, so if you want to see it, it's the best. If you are watching this movie then you will not miss chodwick because they made it possible without chodwick. And the end we miss you lot chodwick goosman. Love you 3000."

The fact they had to have a new black panther I thought was terrible, like why do you have to do that what's the point and by drinking some juice to transform you is very unoriginal if I had a conversation with the director I would say make it original and unique the film was the just like another boring marvel movie with no originality. To be fair the film did keep the audience hooked the only reason why I gave this a 6 out of 10 was the villains of the story they were weird and original I've not seen the comic version but namar did look weird and interesting. They also shouldn't of killed the Queen like the scene were she's saving the girl did she stop or something because I swear they reached the top is it just me there is more I could go on about but I'm not going to bored you so that's just a summary of what I think so thank you."

The water people were better than expected from the previews but the whales? Really? This movie could have been better if they turned Shuri evil. And can someone get her a Sandwich?! Hopefully they find a new awesome actor to fil T'Challa's shoes or else I don't see the Black Panther series having a successful future.
9," Great movie
",jamesslater,/user/ur69992415/,13 November 2022,"Awesome tribute. Obviously sad not to see Chadwick Boseman. Great movie and continuing story given what has happened. Intro of Namor was fantastic, I think they did a great job explaining the back story that could develop into a stand alone movie. Namor carries himself well and they give us a taste of what could be built upon in the under water world. Interested to see where that goes and what else gets introduced from that story line. Sound track was awesome like the first movie. I would go to the theater and watch it again. Watched it in the Dolby theater at AMC which made the whole experience."
10," I REALLY wasn't sure Letitia could carry the mantel by herself...
",spikeypoet,/user/ur85468752/,13 November 2022,"I REALLY wasn't sure Letitia could carry the mantel by herself... and she didn't exactly (do it by herself -- the cast lent overarching support and assisted greatly in what must've been EXTREMELY difficult) but wow!!... she just elevated, upgraded and bolstered her acting skills, in a MAJOR way! I'm speechless!!... Now, don't get me wrong, Chadwick Boseman is in a COMPLETELY different league, and would have made this film (possibly) the best MCU outing, but Letitia still did her thing, despite not having nearly enough experience to carry such a film as the lead.I was apprehensive to watch, when I'd learned that our hero had passed away, and knew that it'd be a completely different movie without him.I was extremely doubtful that it'd work as an ensemble movie, as opposed to a one-man led film. However, I felt that it worked out fine, due to the expert vision of Ryan.The film was super long, which was my only gripe with this movie; the cinema seats were VERY uncomfortable, and I suffer with excruciating back pain, which is amped right up, when seated too long in the wrong chairs.Although the film was long, it was full of action, damned-near from start to finish.Namor (Tanoch Huerta) did a FANTASTIC job as the villain. He was very Killmonger-esque in his motivation, but he just didn't let up, AT ALL!! He was the leader of his race, but he's also a soldier and master tactician. WOW!! This is a perfect movie, regardless of the excessive runtime.Chadwick Boseman was honoured greatly here, which, when you think about it, had Chadwick not passed away, the film would have been AT LEAST 60 minutes shorter; alot of this movie is a tribute to him, explaining and dealing with his death, whilst also being a vehicle to set up a new all-powerful ""villain"", his underwater city and world-build, which explains and justifies the lengthy runtime.If the length of the movie is all that's wrong with it, I'd say that this is a perfect movie.RIP Chadwick Boseman: you will be sorely missed, brother."
10," Sensational!
",mushtaqrayhan,/user/ur150850328/,13 November 2022,"This sequel was absolutely fantastic, so well written and directed by Ryan Coogler. The performances from the cast, particularly Angela Bassett and Letitia Wright were phenomenal and Oscar worthy. Chadwick Boseman is and always will be Black Panther and the film pays an amazing tribute to who was as an individual as well as how significant his character was in the MCU and Shuri (Letitia Wright) does an excellent job of carrying on his legacy as the new protector of Wakanda. It was such an enjoyable and amazingly emotional spectacle that I honestly say that haven't cried this much since endgame, they've definitely put a lot of careful thought and shear hard work into this film and ended phase 4 in the best way possible."
4," This should have ended with Chadwick Boseman..
",kelly-rhodes1,/user/ur16331478/,13 November 2022,"The tributes to Chadwick Boseman are absolutely wonderful and very moving, and were absolutely worth the airtime. (That's what gets the 4 stars) The problem is the rest of the movie... we have a character that looked like a love child of iron man and bumble bee (transformer) which fell massively short in terms of storyline, massively lazy writing,Letitia Wright is a talented actress and all the traits that made her an awesome character, her humour etc were all lost and the character development fell very short for me, and just seemed to be a catalyst for her character rather than her character naturally developing (call me a cynic) badly miscast as the new Black Panther.Mayans storyline and development was gorgeous and so well done but felt like an aqua man/avatar rip off... so this just wasn't the place for that storyline, (this could have had its own epic movie!) and don't even start me on the female warriors new costume, a cross between Abe Sapien from Hellboy and the predator...Now don't get me wrong, it's marvel and I LOVE what they do, this felt like it was badly thought out, the writers threw everything at the wall to see what sticks and way too much stuck... that's just my 2 cents, the reviews will no doubt be 8-9 stars and that's cool, but man I wanted to love this but when you start writing a poor review in your head half way through you know you're not loving it."
5," boring, stale, uncreative
",alexander_f_istanbul,/user/ur65924615/,13 November 2022,"Aaaaand another bad movie from marvel. Are there any good ones at all i may ask? While pb1 had nice action sequences and beautiful costumes and sets, a flawless soundtrack, really great acting with captivating characters and an almost interesting story this movie now is a total bust imo. It is beyond boring and i dont understand why its almost three hrs long?? I do enjoy epic stories and long runtimes when the story of the film requieres that but this movie could be definitely shorter and more exciting. But unfortunately its dull dialogue after dull dialoge, then some cringy >sad< scenes abt death + loss and sometimes some action sequences sprinkled in but they are so generic and dont save the film. AT ALL! And while most sets and fx were spectacular in bp 1 its seems for bp 2 the budget was cut bc some sets and most fx and action sequences look cheap. The underwater world looks very nice, though, and some of the costumes stand out (the beautiful blue ppls head pieces and tenoch huertas costume and jewellery). But while bp 1 was so creative and had somewhat of a soul this film is lacking in eeevery department.I should mention that letitia wright is a true hero because she carries the whole - bad - movie on her shoulders (why isnt it mentioned anywhere that she is the main character actually) and tenoch huerta is a great villain and wonderful talent (he was great in the last purge installment also). Both wright and huerta deserve more leading roles. They truly shine in this messy film.One point of critique: why did the even make a BLACK PANTER movie when there is NO BLACK PANTER!? Its ridiculous!Its time that hollywood finally starts making good movies again instead those silly franchise films."
5," Just more Marvel Garbage
",canucksluvr,/user/ur44782241/,13 November 2022,"Another crap movie from Marvel. They either need to take a break or fire everyone and start over. The movie was too long, had too many plot holes and things that just had no business even being in the movie. So disappointing, I was really wanting this movie to be good. The worst part wad was Samus from Metroid appeared next to Zora from Zelda. It's like they aren't even trying to be creative anymore. People keep going back and watching these garbage movies so why change it? Well Marvel ain't getting another dollar out of me. The only good part of the movie was the beginning and the end. The rest press skip."
9," Emotional, beautiful, cultural game changer and a good plot
",karacutiecares,/user/ur126660418/,13 November 2022,"Right from the beginning I was in tears, and I loved how the culture is shown through out the movie from the funeral, celebrations, clothing and the language.Loved the scene with the queen standing up in the UN room showing her power and mercy. Really captivating and noble moment.The outfits! I'm obsessed! I feel like this will have a major influence on popular culture cause all of the style was amazing!There aren't a lot of big movies where African and Haitian culture are portrayed and I loved the music! Very gripping how the more intense scenes were done!Felt like I couldn't take it when the queen died too, I felt like I couldn't stop the emotions all the way up to the end!The Talokan backstory made me feel for them and it was hard to see them both fight at the end all from some hard choices and misunderstandings that lead to violence. Though they had to create that chain of events to get to the battle at the end.I guess I felt like all of the America scenes could have been left out. Just have the UN scene and the siren scene and leave the rest of the world out. Having the extras there just made the pacing become off.Overall beautiful movie and I do love stories about wars and how you could feel for each side. So I guess I'm biased on that plot. I would watch it again for sure!"
4," Disappointing
",AbdullaAlrahoomi,/user/ur32906354/,13 November 2022,"Would never watch it again.Storyline is below average.Acting was good, but the story is the main weakness.No matter how you see it, the story is weak.I 100% wouldn't mind a female « black panther » in the story but the way they did it is not fitting, her character as black panther is weak, I can't explain it but it hurts seeing the black panther like that!Loosing the fight but winning it in the end was so weird and fake!I tried to avoid being judgmental to the movie, but I couldn't. It hurts seeing the black panther story being brought to this level of meaningless story and weak connection of the key points in the story!Wouldn't rate it more than 4/10."
2," Black Panther Wakanda Forever
",T-ZER0,/user/ur73482986/,13 November 2022,"I loved the first Black Panther. Black Panther was a comic book character I was hardly familiar with, but the movie made me like him and his story a lot. Unfortunately Chadwick Bosemans passing made this movie more difficult to create, and for what it's worth, ""They did a sloppy job!""Honestly, all the amazing things were spoiled in all the trailers they released for this movie, on the YouTube channel for Marvel Entertainment they released a TV spot ever single day! Yes, we all knew Shuri was going to be the Black Panther, anyone who is shocked by this is just plain dumb. Since Chadwick was the main male lead in the previous, the film is mostly female led, and the males are mostly made dumb. M'Baku for example, his first scene in the movie is him eating a meat stick and whining like a kid. What happened to the powerful ruler of the J'Barai?Most of the time I could not decide whether to hate these characters or like them. I always liked Queen Ramonda, I love Angela Bassett, however they made her character into a whining tyrant of a ruler when she stripped Okoye of her rank. Let's also say this, the fact that they killed her in the movie makes no sense. People die in this movie for no valid reason. How did she drown when she was saving Ironheart? Speaking of Ironheart, she is freaking annoying and I dislike her).Namor I wanted to like, but I can't tell if I am supposed to like him or not. By the time the final act came, I was hoping for Rey Mysterio or John Cena to come and save the day just to make this movie watchable.This movie is so saddening and I can't believe this was made. I also can't believe my best friend, was saying that Ramondas death was justified by saying they are ""cleansing"" the MCU. Is that saying that she is a plague? I was hurt.I am definitely done with the MCU, I don't even care if anyone spoils the new movies. I'm done. This movie was so bad I went out and drank afterward. They should have recasted Chadwick or just not made this movie."
10," Everything I needed
",wonderwomanroxx-49169,/user/ur115161702/,13 November 2022,"This was a good follow up to the first Black Panther movie. Angela Bassett deserves an Oscar for her beautiful performance. Quite a few surprises that I wasn't expecting to see but I love that. This movie did everything it needed to do. This movie introducing new characters that I can't wait to see more of. I love the development of the old characters that we knew from the first movie. The movie really shows has it changed over the years, and how Wakanda will be strong forever. Had a great message, which was moving at this time. Would watch again in movie theaters. Loved this movie. Can't wait to see what's next."
6," Obvious Avatar rip-off.
",dustyjoe,/user/ur14666991/,13 November 2022,"Wakanda Forever rips off Avatar concepts and ideas shamelessly. I'll make a list:
1. Plot revolves around precious mineral. Avatar - unobtanium; Black Panther - vibranium.2. Race of blue colored beings.3. Humans want to exploit precious mineral which is found in large quantities right under where blue colored beings live. Exploiting said mineral will inevitably result in the destruction of blue guy race.4. Said blue colored beings can control the minds of large animals.5. Blue colored beings use these animals as means of transportation.6. Blue colored beings are indigenous and spiritual.7. Blue colored beings are anti-technology.The list goes on...I'm surprised James Cameron has not sued Marvel."
8," Its unexpectedly good
",trapp_33,/user/ur126888395/,13 November 2022,"I see that making this movie was a challenge after Chadwick Boseman's death, and it's a great job that they convinced me about the whole thing. First, the plot and story were significant and so good, I liked the world and also how they've linked so many things, the conflict was amazing; and I admired the new thing that was represented in an impressive way. Second, I think the character development was fantastic, with everything the characters went through and how they reacted to it, which was nice and important. My favorite characters are the two main ones: Namor and Shury; they were fascinating, and how they compared and contrasted everything was beautiful. The action was awesome and good, but the most important thing was the theme, it was incredible. The movie is worth seeing, and it was so enjoyable."

",ycgpwydjj,/user/ur153059758/,13 November 2022,"If the above title doesn't give it away this sure Will the haters gonna hate hate hate hate ... but guess what black panther wakanda forever just shakes it off . If you told me last year that we would lose one of the best actors of our generation and told me that the black panther was Gonna be played by someone else well than I might have just slapped you . WELP.... where did I begin. First off I just wanna appreciate Latitia wright and Ryan coogler if I spelled it incorrectly I'm sorry , for the amount of emotions that I felt in this movie . I mean i was crying laughing pumped up . It had it all the action wasn't the best we have seen in marvel but it was pretty damn good and if you ask me on a good day if this movie is better than black panther 1 I might say yea because this movie choose to honor boseman and honor tchalla, in a way that was both emotional and satisfying for his character and let's not even talk about the villain naymor ..... bone chilling seriously freaky asf , and In all my years of reviewing movies and Watching them I didn't cry this much and I want to thank this movie for that . Last thing I'll say is as much as I loved it and as much and I think the new black panther is great and didn't feel forced and felt natural is great, however iron heart was kinda a wild card after this movie i don't know if it's the performance or just the way they felt with it I didn't like it . And the runtime was a bit too long . Other than that Ryan Coogler was dealt a terrible hand with a terrible death of Chadwick Boseman and they managed to pull this off with Letitia Wright making a performance that is Oscar worthy and really made me think about this movie as I came home I loved it."

",alvirasalman,/user/ur142645199/,13 November 2022,"I didn't know if it would be as incredible as the first but omg- if you haven't watched it yet, drop everything and go to the cinema right now!! Every single character is so well fleshed out and the theme of grief and acceptance is done incredibly well. Every single actor (especially Letitia) did exceptional jobs and there was not one scene that was lacking. The film is so beautiful and all the emotion and the comedy just hits perfectly. The introduction of new characters was done very well and it was easily one of marvel's best movies. It was also quite dark for an mcu movie which was really interesting to watch, especially the Talokans. I would definitely watch again (and again). Boseman was missed :( but the film is a loving tribute to him and still managed to live up to the Black Panther standard."
4," Predictable every second
",josemoct99,/user/ur102280813/,13 November 2022,"Although visually it maintains its quality, the story has many forced coincidences, the reasons why the events happen are absurd and often even funny. The writers don't seem to have tried very hard, some Disney moments are noticeable and cringe, it's unnecessarily long and anyone with half a brain would know what would happen next scene, the enemies are a joke, the conflicts are resolved with the power of love and only two important things happen that would have really shown me with a 15-minute short film instead of making a whole movie that wants to give sensations that never existed. Marvel is declining."
9," Impacful emotion and epic moments
",spiralflick,/user/ur66329740/,13 November 2022,8.5 for me overall the film does a very good job at bringing out the remeberance and emotion of losing loved ones and especially great people like Chadwick and the impact of his loss was felt throughout the film but overall every aspect of the film was done very well and was definitely to my liking the only thing that annoyed me was trailing off with meaningless side characters like the fbi guy Ross and the movie was a little too long which made it loose the 1.5 stars for me but the film is great and I thoroughly enjoyed it the only mcu film that I plan on watching again when released this year the others not so much.
9," One of the best MCU films
",ymrhqtrz,/user/ur133737315/,13 November 2022,"Black Panther 2, wow!!! I went into the theater knowing that this film would touch on Chadwick Bosemans death, but I had no idea how in depth it would go. The characters mourn the death of their king, whilst also having to fight off a new threat. In the moments between how the characters process their emotions was done amazingly. The 5 stages of grief were present, and the emotion was there and it felt like you were grieving with them. Praise needs to be given to Angela, Letitia and Danai! They have amazing performances. There was a twist in the film that I will not be spoiling that caught me off guard and saw black panther raise the stakes. The pacing of the film at times was drawn out but made up for by the multiple fast paced action scenes. I honestly can't wait to see what they do with black panther 3. The film genuinely was one of the best MCU films, the acting, the plot, the cinematography, the cgi were on point. I would highly recommend this film."
6," Disturbing
",edicthai,/user/ur158734054/,13 November 2022,"Why is the sister mourned the death of brother (Black Panther) more than the mother or the girlfriend? And why there is no ethnicity representative in the Wakanda nation? If this is not an issue why when so many movies has to be forced to use multi-ethnicity actors to act as citizens of the same nation? If Batman can be played by different actors why can't Black Panther too? Thus, Hollywood needs to stop to be political correct and forced us to watch a movie where it doesn't make sense to have different ethnicity to act as brothers or sisters...Marvel movie is fast losing ground to DC which is why it is DC turn to take over the superhero market."
7," Good tribute, somewhat average movie
",wendieta,/user/ur75218339/,13 November 2022,"This is a fitting tribute to Chadwick Boseman. It's not overly done, and I feel it's respectful enough, although I'm not entirely satisfied about the cause of the character's death. I agree the character of T'challa shouldnt be replaced, despite Boseman's brother insisting otherwise. There are things I like about the movie, like how Shuri doesnt take the mantle of Black Panther too early, and how she doesnt automatically become queen opon her mother's death. I also like that she is conflicted when she first took the herb. Many to like, but there are some things that I feel make this movie feel average. First, the heart shaped herb. Shuri only succeeded in making the synthetic herb after sampling the properties of the bracelet given by Namor because the fiber is made of ""vibranium rich plant."" If I'm not mistaken, Wakanda is pretty rich in vibranium itself. Second, the MCU has always had one big problem: the villains. Other than Thanos, Loki and Kilmonger, the villains in MCU are pretty weak. Namor is no exception. Third, Shuri led her people to a massacre because she wanted revenge, and the Wakandans still feel she's fit to be the Black Panther? She doesnt even feel guilty about it afterwards. At least make her face the repercussions of her actions and choices. And fourth, Riri Williams aka Ironheart. In the comics, she stole the iron man tech, which I dont like but at least makes sense. In the movie, she made the whole thing from scrap. How the hell did she have the knowledge, materials, and technology to create it from the ground up? I get she's portrayed as a genius but she has neither Stark tech nor the fund. Maybe I just dont like the character. Overall, I give it a 7 because it's a fitting tribute to Boseman and it's still much better than recent Marvel efforts like Thor Love and Thunder and especially the Disney+ series."
7," Good Entertainment
",tayangangambar,/user/ur109112857/,13 November 2022,"I really enjoyed the drama, pace and soundtrack of this Black Panther sequel. It is well made, tight and serious, not much unnecessary humor or corny characters/scenes.Given the circumstances, they really made it work by pivoting of storyline and paying the necessary tribute without having to make too much excuse of the change.The editing was tight and the soundtrack was spot on. I would say this Marvel movie has really good acting by the cast. With a good script and a dramatic cast, this made made this movie engaging and enjoyable even though it was about 2.5 hours long.All that being said, with the start and middle of the movie being really good, I was expect more in the final act, i.e. More dramatic.Overall, it was worth it."

10," Wakanda Forever, Indeed
",11ovz11,/user/ur39615797/,13 November 2022,"An emotional, tender, and a mature Marvel movie that is also a tribute to Chadwick Boseman but, mostly to Black Panther itself.Unlike other phase 4 Marvel movies (looking at Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness and Thor: Love and Thunder), which were overhyped, unfunny, and pointless, the second coming of the Black Panther is a big leap to the right side of good cinema. While it had the usual ""Marvel humour"", the plot weaved around personal loss, despair, family bond, overcoming depression, and women empowerment. Truly unlike Marvel, the movie was subtle in emotions, and often tugged at our heartstrings reminding of what could have been, and what kind of loss we are experiencing by the untimely death of the previous Black Panther (and actor Chadwick Boseman). There were about five or six times where I genuinely shed tears.That being said, this is a superhero movie after all. So, we do have the tech-wizard Shuri along with another genius building up superhero costumes in no time. We have a great anti-hero as Namor, truly questioning whether he is right or wrong. We have our CGI fights which are very well done again (as opposed to the Avatar-like costumes the Not-Atlantic people were wearing).I know that Namor was introduced first in the comic book world, before Aquaman, and that Namor is not exactly a hero, but he did reminded me a lot of Aquaman, but in a more realistic way than the latter ever did.Most importantly, I should mention Angela Bassett's portrayal of Queen Ramonda, who, in my opinion gave an Oscar-worthy performance. The rest of the cast were impressive as well.Overall, this is a must watch movie and the best in Marvel Phase 4 after all, if not the best movie of Marvel, save it for Iron Man 1."

The no music only emotion's pat was a very thoughtful implementation.As for the movie, this is the best, most sort after storyline I've seen from Marvel.

6," Good ideas wasted
",guidocolato,/user/ur152806172/,13 November 2022,"This movie comes with some great ideas, most of the times you're watching it thinking about the next move or the next segment of the story, but the pace of the story is always interrupted by scenes that feel completely out of place.This brings to the core issue, the length of the picture is 2 hours and 43 minutes, with a messy pace and very hard to follow fight scenes, it gets boring really fast, and very predictable up until the end, where we get to see yet another incomprehensible fight scene, and a very weak ending to the story.Visually stunning at times, but relies way too much on CGI and green screen, sometimes shots feel unfinished, to the a degree it gets laughably bad.The score by Ludwig Goransson was very good, incredibly wild and truly dramatic when it needed to be.And finally, a very heartfelt tribute to Chadwick , well done and properly set up and concluded."
7," A beautiful and ambitious epic
",Ireviewstuff_exe,/user/ur151780514/,13 November 2022,"Black Panther Wakanda Forever is a fitting and touching tribute to Chadwick Boseman. You can tell that they purposely dialled down the usual MCU humour to give this movie the somber tone it needed. The memorial scenes at the beginning and ending of the movie are handled very well. They are respectful of his legacy and poignant. And although the beating heart of the first movie in Boseman isn't there, Letitia Wright still manages to pull off a rousing and impressive performance, stepping into Chadwick's shoes and taking up the mantle of The Black Panther. Another superb performance inside of this movie is Angela Basset as Queen Ramonda. With her scenes at the UN and the throne room being highlights. Tenoch Huerta is also very good as Namor. Who although is different from the comics is very interesting as a character. Another bright spot in the movie is the visuals. Coogler really nailed it here. There are many simply breathtaking shots especially in the underwater scenes and Wakandan scenes. Another strength is the side characters. Riri Williams played by Dominique Thorne is fun when on screen and it made me more excited for her Disney + show. As always, Winston Duke's M'Baku was very cool. And Martin Freeman returns again as Everett Ross and although he has a minor part to play in the movie's story, he is still enjoyable. Despite all these positives the movie definitely isn't perfect. It is overlong and perhaps too light on action (although when there is action it is done very well), the movie sometimes feels too slow-paced and it potentially could have devoted more of it's runtime to paying respect to Chadwick Boseman. Another odd thing I noticed was the designs of some of the characters and costumes. Some of them feel slightly derivative at times. Especially Namor's people, who look a lot like the people from Avatar. Which was especially funny since the cinema I watched it at played trailers for Way of the Water before the movie started. Another odd thing that I noticed was Ironheart's suit. It looks more like the Red Power Ranger suit or Samus's suit then a Iron Man style suit, with that being said though, it was nice to see some Iron Man style action again.All in all, I really liked this movie and thought it was a fitting tribute to Boseman.I'll give it an 8/10."

Maybe I'll try to watch the first part of this and then connect the idea of both movies but for now I just want to run out of the theater and watch Netflix instead.Just another superhero/alien movie that try to protect their tribe to save their species blablabla. Also what's with the almost 3 hours movie God this movie takes forever. If only I can re-pick movie I'll choose kids movie rather than sit too long for this.

Lies and more lies, it's like Groundhog day but that was a far superior movie.What has changed? I'm not sure, there was a time when I couldn't wait for the next instalment. Now I dred it. I have 3 sons who are Marvel mad, so a trip to the cinema is an expensive night out.Nearly Â£100 on a night out to a movie. So after Multiverse of Madness and Love and Thunder I was dreading this.Anyways, all I can say is this, my sons all said that they wish we went bowling instead.Another monotonous Marvel movie that will be our last in the cinema.My best advice is to wait till its on Disney plus and save your money for something else."
8," A fine way to cap off Phase IV
",ethanbresnett,/user/ur114450253/,13 November 2022,"Wakanda Forever has so many strong elements, definitely marking it out as one of the better films of Phase 4.It has a really well developed plot which takes some interesting angles and approaches to its central conflict.The treatment of Chadwick Boseman's passing is very sensitively and emotionally handled, making the film a real tear-jerker at times as you can see the actors drawing on their very real pain.The new additions to the cast are all really good and are handled well, not overwhelming you with excessive exposition or overcrowding the film at all.Dominique Thorne as Ironheart is a wonderful addition, and I look forward to future projects with her. Namor is a brilliant antagonist, one of the finest in the MCU with a terrific performance from Tenoch Huerta.I loved the comedy in this film, never trying too hard but always drawing a laugh.I do think some of the action sequences could have been developed and pushed a bit more, although saying that there were some fantastic moments.The runtime is perhaps slightly bloated, but not by much and that can be forgiven given the other accomplishments of the film.Overall Wakanda Forever is a very fine way to end Phase 4 of the MCU. On its own, it stands up as a very entertaining, emotional, and punchy film, but it also tugs at some interesting threads in the overarching Marvel story, promising good things to come."
8," Moving and such a relief
",andyfish-09563,/user/ur155179117/,13 November 2022,"I dithered about seeing this at the cinema. I have seen all 29 preceding movies there, but after the pathetic Thor movie & the general unevenness of Phase 4, I thought about breaking the habit.But I'm glad I went. I genuinely enjoyed it & appreciated the more serious tone.It gave the previously supporting characters a chance to shine - especially Shuri, who graduated from spunky sidekick - and Queen Ramonda, who was impressively majestic.And great to see more of Okoye (although her costume at the end is ghastly)Namor made a credible villain who was ruthless and aggressive for understandable reasons.And, surprisingly, I did not miss the actual Black Panther role. I enjoyed the aspect of others working together.It is too long though. A few too many conversations. Although not because I was impatient to get to the action.Also, Namor seems a little too powerful. And strolls into Wakanda twice, bypassing their supposedly super-advanced defences without any trouble at all.Also the theory that Shuri is working on to weaken Namor's troops is promptly forgotten & we have the obligatory mass hand to hand combat at the end. That was too obvious and quite tedious, lifted by some good individual combat.Why does Marvel constantly fall back onto mass fight scenes? Individual fights are far more engaging.In all, I hope this is MCU getting back on track."
9," Amazing movie, highly recommend 9/10!
",hashimboi,/user/ur158785433/,13 November 2022,"This film was amazing and the best Marvel film I've seen for a while. Namor was brilliant, and Letitia Wright was amazing as Shuri and Queen Ramonda was great. Considering the whole film had to change following Chadwick Boseman's death, it is miraculous that this film is this good. The handling of his death is good, and there is an interesting cameo. I found that Shuri's arc during this film was perfect too. A slight criticism is of a few subplots which didn't really need to be there, however I did like Ironheart and I loved Namor's backstory and all the different cultures. This is a beautiful film."
6," Wasted potential
",luftpumpenfisch,/user/ur95036081/,13 November 2022,"It's a solid movie but there was potential for it to be a great movie. Namors plan seemed to be pretty reasonable at first until he wants to destroy everything on the surface instead of being left alone. The plot in America with the FBI felt unnecessary as well, leading to a movie that's too long for it's own good. The cgi was horrible in some scenes although it looked decent in most scenes. On the other hand there was a villain that was at least partly reasonable and a interesting development of his and the protagonist. The cultural aspect of of his people was great as well painting them as not soulless generic enemies but reasonable fighters that fight for their own country and ideals as well. All in all this movie was solid but had potential to reach the first one that it didn't reach because of some decisions by the writers."
4," boring....
",kchubm1976,/user/ur33391075/,13 November 2022,"So boring i admit that i was tired from a long day but i almost fell asleep 3-4 times and propably missed like 5 minutes, still struggling to remember martin freeman s role in the movie, his american accent was also very distracting. In general basically no men in the movie, no black banther in the movie (except like the last 15 minutes), no protagonist in the movie, that plot with the extra vibanium doesnt make much sense, run of the mill villain. Also white people are evil , music was terrible, zero originality in every way especially considering the lifted iron man 1 scenes with worse cgi -somehow- and the general look felt like a fancy bourlesque show with all African American cast (and a very bad martin freeman). For me it was the worst movie i ve seen all year and it shows me that phase 4 is so lost and it feels like they dont know what to do with this product and i mean the whole MCU anymore."
3," Let's kill each other for 2 .30 hours...
",pmarinecp,/user/ur75880074/,13 November 2022,"Let's kill each other for 2 .30 hours and than suddenly let's be friends. Yeap pretty stupid ideea...but that's not all...Namor wants to kill Rori for something thats already done and it's in the hand of americans...the machine that discover vibranium...so kill Rori and the blueprints for the machine will dissappier...and the Ironheart...so cheap doned and so without character developing...from were she has money to develope that ugly suit...or maintain her ""laboboratory""...she just a student...Wakanda for-never it's a weak movie with bad plot, too much crying, stupid reasons....let's jump to phase 5, maybe maybe...."
4," A Chad Boseman memorial, Too slow
",arthas88,/user/ur23147000/,13 November 2022,"This movie was about paying respect to Chad Boseman, the screenplay could have been easily been 1 hour 10 mins, but may be the director felt Shuri's character needed more depth, unfortunately character development could have been sped up by letting Shuri grief, they just ask her to bottle up her feelings and chase down unnecessary characters. This does not feel like a cohesive Marvel movie, screenplay was slow as well.However, acting was above par, action set pieces were well done however they were far in-between, post credit scene just fulfils the emotional connect required for the memorial to come full circle.The pacing is what is killed the movie otherwise it would have been a fitting tribute."
8," W movie
",rrtreal,/user/ur157360221/,13 November 2022,"This movie was honestly good, it might not suit the name 'black panther' because the black panther arrived only in the last 30 mins and didn't have much screen time, but as wakandans and their struggle against the enemy the plot was good, the movie was a good theatrical experience with great VFX and background music, a good tribute to Chadwick boseman as well. But the movie lacked a little continuity and adding iron heart as the scientist didn't seem like the best idea. But in the end the antagonist, namor the king of talokans was really great, he was terrifying, played his role to perfection."
8," A fitting tribute/continuation
",blueboys3085,/user/ur15557161/,13 November 2022,"Was a heartfelt well done film they were obviously painted in a corner with Chadwick's untimely passing, but feel they handled it as well as they possibly could have didn't let the story get dragged down by it but still kept the story about loss and handling of death.The story itself is fairly standard comic book stuff but was done with a softer more story telling style that I appreciate is not for everyone. Found the villain both compelling and ominous exactly as they should be in these movies.The use of chi was good without being amazing but still visually appealing throughout the action sequences were strong and compelling.Do yourselves a favour and watch in cinema."
9," There was somebody cutting onions that's why I was crying
",Benslie,/user/ur69664646/,13 November 2022,"With the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman, the story for this movie needed to find a way to pass on the torch and honour him and this story does all of that to a certain extent. The story for this movie is unlike any other Marvel movie we've seen so far. There's so much raw emotion in this movie that will make everybody say either I'm not crying, you're crying or someone's cutting onions in here. But for the most part that's only the first part of this movie. The story of this movie is split into three different parts and they try to connect them seamlessly but it doesn't always work. The only parts of this movie's story that connect seamlessly are the second and third parts. I will give the movie this they tried to connect the first part into the third part and it did work. But honestly, nothing could save the second part of this movie's story from not being the slowest part of this movie. This movie is 2 hours and 41 minutes long and honestly, it didn't need to be that long. There's a lot of filler in this movie that easily could've been removed and nothing would've been missed. But at the end of the day, this movie just didn't feel like an MCU movie. There weren't that many jokes being shoved down your throat constantly or some slapstick just because. This movie just felt like a movie honouring a man who was lost way too early. This all can be traced back to one man who's Ryan Coogler, the writer and director. Ryan Coogler understood that once Chadwick Boseman had passed this movie had to honour him and his impact and did that flawlessly. Those who saw this movie either having not seen a previous Marvel movie with Black Panther in it could still understand the impact Chadwick Boseman had on those around him. (Continued in Comments)He wrote this movie so beautifully and I would love to read what the original script was. It wasn't just his writing that made this movie but also his directing of it. He brings the same passion he had for the first movie to this one as well. He knew exactly how to get some kind of emotional reaction out of the audience or how to just keep their attention throughout this movie. It's due to Ryan Coogler's wonderful story and directing that all of the acting performances in this movie feel so raw. You could easily tell that every actor in this movie wanted to make this movie as great of a movie as can be to honour Chadwick Boseman. Due to this, it's hard to tell if this is the character's grief or the actors but no matter what it brings the audience to tears as well. There are so many amazing performances in this movie that it's hard to pick a favourite but I have to say that Letitia Wright really stood out. This movie mainly follows her and her journey of accepting that her brother is dead. She brought so much to this character that you really feel for her character and what she's going through. She goes on this emotional rollercoaster that anyone who has lost a close loved one can relate to her. But Shuri wasn't the only one to go through an emotional rollercoaster but Queen Ramonda, played by Angela Bassett, also goes on one and it's amazing. Obviously, the biggest difference between Shuri and Queen Ramonda is the fact she lost her son and Angela Bassett shows that so well. She has so many emotional moments and all of them hit so hard that it leaves the audience on the verge of tears. Whenever she was on the screen she held the audience's attention with every single word she said. She shows how much Queen Ramonda cares for her family and how this loss has affected her in more ways than one. This movie also introduced the audience to two new characters in the MCU and I can't wait to see more of them. The first one we got to meet is Riri, played by Dominique Thorne, and I can't wait for her solo show. Dominique Thorne played her in such a way that she knows she's smart but doesn't brag about it. (Continued below)She's this sympathetic character who just wants to do the right thing. I also love how down-to-earth she plays Riri. She reminds us that despite being a child prodigy she is just a kid who gets excited over things no matter how small. We don't get to see much of her in this movie so I can't wait to see how she'll expand the character in her own show. The other character we meet is Namor and I really hope we get to see more of him. Namor is easily one of the best MCU villains and that's all thanks to Tenoch Huerta's performance. He plays Namor in such a way you don't know whether he's a villain or not. He's this sympathetic guy that you can kind of understand where he's coming from. Unfortunately, we don't get to fully experience why exactly he's doing this but no matter what, Tenoch Huerta does a memorable job and I can't wait to see him in more MCU movies to come. A trademark of Marvel recently has been the bad CGI and for me personally, the CGI here wasn't bad at all. The CGI looked pretty good and helped the audience really feel like they were there in this underwater civilization. This also could be due to the darkness but I want to give them some credit okay. The last thing I'll mention is the music in this movie, composed by Ludwig GÃ¶ransson. The music in this movie was incredible and really helped the scenes they were accompanying. Whether the scene was a sad one or one of tension the music matched perfectly to it. It wasn't just the musical score either but the regular music as well that helped this movie out. Through the actor's performances and the background music, the audience could easily figure out what exactly is going on and how to feel. In the end, Black Panther Wakanda Forever might not be the most perfect movie but you can feel how much emotion was put into making it. Definitely a good send-off to both phase 4 of the MCU and Chadwick Boseman."
7," Marvel is falling
",BoulosSoueileh,/user/ur63069428/,13 November 2022,"I love black panther, we all do.But a 2hours 43 minutes movie that could be an hour and half movie.The scene of the funeral was beautiful and touchy but everything after is a lot of dialogue and little action.It wasn't a bad movie, it was a long movie that anyone could easily get bored, some scenes could be trimmed or even send to waste, like the flashbacks for the antagonist early life!! So cliche marvel, all super villain come from a dark places where they were tortured and misjudged. The scene of the United nation is useless, the movie could easily start with the American army finding Vibranium under sea.And tbh seeing a woman as a black panther, yes Disney strikes again, same as for black Ariel, this will never stop soon.I have nothing against anyone but for god sake stop putting gay scene for no reason, stop using black actors where they do not fit and stop replacing men with women, man even Thor was a woman in a movie.When was the last time we watched a perfect marvel movie ? Yes it was Avenger Endgame.And wasn't better idea to leave black panther for ""Chadwick Boseman"", respect his legacy, respect everything he gave for the fans and Marvel. Black panther was and will always be Chadwick Boseman !"
5," Hit and Miss
",tvbyrpmg,/user/ur154665278/,13 November 2022,"Chadwick Bosman's loss is felt in this sequel. Beautiful worlds they've created in Wakanda and Namor's kingdom. Each civilization has a rich history. The production and costume design teams went above and beyond. Movie was a bit slow moving, belaboring certain interpersonal moments to the point of exhaustion, many emotional moments came across as cheesy or became hard to be believable. I like that it didn't overly rely on big action sequences. It was appropriate to focus on grief. Certain character's changes/arc's didn't seem to carry over into this film. It was like they were back to their old ways despite what they'd overcome previously."
9," A good follow up and even a better tribute to the amazing Late Chadwick Boseman
",turnmeonsb,/user/ur51311256/,13 November 2022,"I went in there with minimal expectations, since this year has been disappointing for MCU, to say the least. But I was surprised at the quality of the movie, the emotional depth and the overall technical aspect( VFX mainly). It has fewer cheer worthy scenes as compared to its predecessor but has overall a lasting impact. Also, Namor was a great addition and Talokan was visually pleasing( not as much as Aquaman's Atlantis, but then that movie was all about it). Although I did miss a strong lead that the great Chadwick Boseman was, but was pleased to see the overall Women power in this film and it does gives a glimpse of how things can be good even without a strong, male lead. One of the best part was *spoiler alert* N'Jadaka in the ancestral plane! Even with that little time, Michael B. Jordan owned the scene! Do give this movie a watch if you wish to wash down the unpleasant taste that the previous MCU release left in our mouths."
9," Awesome movie
",mapj-94922,/user/ur157521311/,13 November 2022,"This is a beautiful tribute to Chadwick. The opening and ending credits are very touching. No one could ever replace him, or even come close to him. And they aren't trying to. MCU is showing how Wakanda and his family try to move forward after the loss of their King. Watch it with an open mind, and you'll appreciate the film and new story line. The MCU honors their friend in the most memorable way. And those of us that loved the character and Chadwick as an actor can share in that tribute to him. Bottom line this film has everything a MCU film needs, action, drama, comedy and unfortunately for this one an emotional pull. Yet after losing Chadwick one would expect this film to be as such."
7," A Good Movie... With Quite a Few Flaws
",TRIDENT1745,/user/ur88834390/,13 November 2022,"This was a pretty good movie and wrapped up phase 4 pretty well. The idea of the Avatar style water world was executed quite well on screen, while the movie paid a good amount of respect to the original.But a few flaws did stand out.Firstly, the emphasis on the ""American scientist"" kid was really heavy, like the queen would shield her with her own body? That the princess would not leave without her, risking herself, the hier? Yes I understand this is the nature of Wakanda but this just was a tad excessive given that this girl had nothing to do with Wakanda, except for the fact that she's a political asset since she can make Vibranium detecting machines.Secondly, the runtime was a little excessive. Nearly three hours, when so many scenes could have been cut? Pretty slow pacing throughout.Thirdly, the final fight scene was a little disappointing. Complete lack of air and underwater combat. Any fighting that could be physically intense occurred on a rectangular surface, on top of the ship, not to mention that the only purpose of the ship was to serve as a rectangle of land. There wasn't even a single shot of the inside of the ship, or it cracking or leaking. It was a literal, unrealistic brick.Fourthly, there were some pretty bad scene cuts, and the movie was pretty inconsistent at times. From an incredibly emotional scene to a 10 minute drag of a conversation to a pretty unintense fight scene.Again, it was a pretty good movie overall. Would I recommend it? Yes. Would I watch it again? Probably not."
6," Not nearly as good as the first one
",said-buet10,/user/ur45612702/,13 November 2022,"Considering the quality of all the recent Marvel movies and TV shows this is really good. But considering their whole portfolio this is not great, just a typical marvel superhero movie but definitely a step towards the right direction.The movie pays tribute to the charismatic actor Chadwick Boseman in a tasteful way. That bit was emotional and fitting. But from that this was a slow paced movie with a boring storytelling. I felt this same story could've been told in a more engaging way.There were sequences after sequences which didn't have a natural transition in story. They were just added together to introduce characters or problems. The death of certain character should've had more impact. The counterattack by Wakanda was weird. Two warriors with super suit joining after the battle was fought for a while was pointless. The way only a handful of main characters were pushed to a corner after a long battle was stupid to say the least (Three of them had abilities to fly!)They tried to have dramatic revels of characters too much. It was not necessary. I did not hate the movie but I will probably not watch it again."
10," Wakanda forever, there's a movement!!!
",yorelaileen,/user/ur158750853/,13 November 2022,"Marvel truly did their numbers with this movie. Excellent movie for the whole family to enjoy, and the tribute to Chadwick Boseman. Our truly heartfelt, and he surely will be missed in the Black Panther movies and on the big screen. The movie showed that people can go through hardships and still endure.It is a movie that people will want to see more than once. If you haven't seen it yet, I truly recommend that you go see this movie. For it is a movie that will be talked about for ages. Yes it is. It is good as the first of the sequel. I'm looking forward to Black Panther three. Wakanda Forever!!!!!"
8," Excellent way to pay tribute to Chadwick Boseman
",natosoares,/user/ur78406325/,13 November 2022,"The Phase 4 MCU comes to an end with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. It's been a truly inconsistent film series. There was the best of this phase with (Shang-Chi, Spider-Man, some from Dr. Strange 2), the more or less (other parts of Dr. Strange 2, Black Widow and Eternals) and the weak (Thor 4, which is easily one of the worst MCU movies so far).If you expect Black Panther 2 to end Phase 4, you might be disappointed. But then again, there hasn't been a consistent narrative over the last couple of years of Marvel releases, so there's really nothing to conclude, overall. It's important to point out that it's just a really good movie, and that's enough to ensure it ends Phase 4 on a high, but there's a lot about Black Panther 2 that's extremely effective, and enough good stuff for me to think it's a good movie in its own right. General.I think rhythm is his greatest strength. I didn't really notice the more than two hours time go by. The opening half hour didn't flow in the best way, but there was a need for adjustment after the death of Chadwick Boseman meant that T'Challa died too. Once the movie establishes that and sets up its main plot, it's pretty smooth and, unlike many Marvel movies, saves its most emotional moments and best action scenes for its excellent final hour.It's a very moving film, and the way he respects Boseman and T'Challa is essentially well-executed, bordering on perfection. With good action scenes and a solid story, a new antagonist character emerges (Namor and the whole underworld were great) and fantastic music (one of the best Marvel soundtracks in my opinion), this was a very good MCU movie, that's right. I mean it gives us a little more hope for the franchise going forward."
9," Deeply Passionate...Darker and Serious!!
",professordj,/user/ur157124771/,13 November 2022,"Simply put this movie is filled with surprises which makes it interesting and unusual for a Marvel movie! Characters that I expected to have one angle had opposite attitudes than I expected!! VERRRY good on the introduction of Namor including his backstory, especially the actor's portrayal of the character! Excellent acting, direction, and production value! Visually stunning in terms of special effects, Wakanda forever is a true upgrade visually because it had to be. The story took the initiative in taking on cultural conflicts using Wakanda and Tolokan as metaphorical representatives of present cultures. Excellent movie."
10," I really liked it
",abdulrahmanal-47002,/user/ur151602034/,13 November 2022,"This movie was a masterpiece in my opinion, it was emotional and Chadwick bosemans death was mentioned multiple times in the movie, the soundtrack was 10/10 without even thinking about it, the way they used background music with some fabulous cgi scenes made me fall in love with this movie, the movie had good sense of humor and there were only about 3 scenes with humor they didn't overuse them, shuri's character development was amazing we can expect so much from her in future project's, cgi was amazing nothing was bad in this movie about the cgi. Now I have to talk about namor and talokan, the way they introduced talokan with amazing cgi and amazing background music made so satisfied, Namor was such a good villan he actually made me feel wakanda was in danger after what he did in the first attack, this movie was amazing in my opinion but the way they explained Chadwick boseman death at the beginning didn't make me happy, if you watched the movie it wasn't perfect because imagine his family members watching that scene knowing he is dead, it was good but wasn't that respectful, the movie is 9/10 but because of how they introduced Chadwick boseman death made the movie 8/10."
9," Absolute Banger
",shenaldilmith-66455,/user/ur158779330/,13 November 2022,"An absolute banger by Ryan Coogler. This movie is packed with emotions along with some great action sequences. Marvel Phase 4 really ended strong. It is highly recommended. Ryan Coogler has accomplished the impossible. All-around great acting by Angela Basset, Letitia Wright, and all the other supporting cast. And Namor is one of the best MCU villains. A loving and respected tribute to the Great Chadwick Boseman. Riri Williams is an instant fan favoriteThe score from Ludwig GÃ¶ransson did not miss at all. The VFX, BGM the acting was so damn good and the Mid Credit scene is one of the most touching and emotional moments in the MCU. I would have preferred if it was a 10 minutes shorter but then again I think it was necessary. Angela Basset deserves an Oscar Nomination for sure. CBM of the Year without a doubt."
8," Curveball
",sktraut,/user/ur98644452/,13 November 2022,"Not your typical Marvel movie. For much of the runtime, there isn't really even a superhero. Of course Black Panther does return, but it is deserved and built up to. The story is mostly about various characters, even nations navigating a world now aware of Wakanda and vibranium. Sure, there is a giant cgi battle at the end (Marvel couldn't end it any other way), but the conflict is more nuanced than BP1. If the villain isn't as interesting or original as Killmonger, he is more sympathetic. His motivation is the survival of his people - not unlike Shuri. The movie is well-shot and has many creative sequences done practically (Shuri at one point seems to emerge from water completely dry; all they had to do was film her entering the water and reverse the footage). This isn't an ugly 3D-animated mess: there are people behind the camera and in front of the camera too. The cherry on top is that it pays tribute to Chadwick Boseman without objectifying his death. The movie stands on its own and yet sets up a third BP movie to be excited about, with larger stakes and flesh and blood, allegorical villains. Not another cartoon monster."
10," The best movie of Phase 4 after Spider-Man: No Way Home(2021).
",Anurag-Shetty,/user/ur31646645/,13 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever continues with the story of Shuri(Letitia Wright), Nakia(Lupita Nyong'o), Okoye(Danai Gurira), Ramonda(Angela Bassett), M'Baku(Winston Duke) & the rest of Wakanda & its citizens. After the tragic loss of King T'Challa, the Wakandans must do everything to protect their home from world powers looking to capitalize on the death of their king & protector, the Black Panther.Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a mind-blowing film. Director Ryan Coogler has made sure that the movie is a beautiful & moving tribute to Chadwick Boseman, while simultaneously taking the story forward seamlessly. There are several emotional scenes that will make you tear up as we the fans & the people of Wakanda, come to terms with the huge loss of King T'Challa/Chadwick Boseman. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The visual effects are phenomenal. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. The costume design by Ruth E. Carter & the production design by Hannah Beachler are impeccable. Letitia Wright is spectacular as Shuri. Wright captures the immense pain that her character is going through, with ease & panache. Lupita Nyong'o is fantastic as Nakia. Danai Gurira is brilliant as Okoye. Winston Duke is superb as M'Baku. Angela Bassett is excellent as Ramonda. Bassett delivers an extremely emotional & powerful performance as the grieving Queen Ramonda. Tenoch Huerta is outstanding as Namor. Huerta steals the show in every scene he's in & I can't wait to see his character's next appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Martin Freeman is awesome as Everett Ross. Dominique Thorne is amazing as Riri Williams. The supporting cast is perfect. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a must watch for Marvel Cinematic Universe fans & fans of Black Panther(2018). It will surpass your high expectations. Go & witness this emotional rollercoaster ride!"
9," Long love the king
",mrashtastic89,/user/ur106007927/,13 November 2022,"Where do I even begin? Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is everything I wanted from not just an MCU movie but a tribute to the legendary Chadwick Boseman a beautiful and heartwarming tribute to one of the best castings in the MCU, King T'Challa.This film is beautiful, and it almost makes it's way into my current top 10 MCU films of all time, I saw this in a packed theater, which definitely helped, it's a visually brilliant movie to look at, just like the first one it's got amazing cinematography and one of the best MCU soundtracks of all time, while also having one of the best Phase 4 cameos ever, I won't spoil.Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett both have truly fantastic performances, and it also gave epic character development to the bad-ass women Okoye, Shuri, and Ironheart, with an incredible villain with Namor, doing a fantastic job adapting him from the comics.And it's also got one of the most emotional mid credits scenes I've seen in a long time and hard hitting underwater scenes, and this will no doubt go down in history as one of the best MCU sequels ever.I'm gonna give Black Panther: Wakanda Forever an A."
7," Could Have Been Great
",loganschainker,/user/ur124984625/,13 November 2022,"Black Panther, in my opinion, is the most overrated film of all time. It wasn't bad, and it was certainly far from great. The fact that it got nominated for best picture is a joke. For the majority of this film however, I found myself to be really liking it. The slower pace, and cinematography were aspects that I was not expecting to appreciate. Sadly there are a few issues that really bog it down for me. The first one being that there is a new Black Panther, I won't say who but I think it would've been more impactful if no one took on the mantle. The Ironheart character felt extremely underdeveloped. And the climax was very unsatisfying. Overall this film is about as Oscar worthy as it's predecessor, in that it's not Oscar worthy at all."
4," Mexicans, aquaman, the predator and avatar (?)
",rebeca-py,/user/ur24684274/,13 November 2022,"So, they just mixed a lot of movies and try delivered something new. Horrible.I actually like the effects, the costumes and music, but the plot was lacking originality and did not end. So, after almost 3 hours you left the cinema without a conclusion.Also, I did not enjoy how they introduce the ""Mexicans"" or the people of Nabor. Why they have to make them villains with no brain? To many holes in the plot there.I hope Disney do not delivered a serie of this saga, it should end with the next movie or develop a more deeper plot, which I think they can not do at this point.If you ask me, don't go to the cinema, watch it at home."
4," Jumbled mess with no lead, huge plot holes and boring dialogue in subtitles
",brianmlucas,/user/ur23097787/,13 November 2022,"Whole plot lines, scenes, and characters were totally unnecessary and dragged the run time into 2 and a half hours that seemed like 4. They could have cut at least 45 minutes. And in doing so made Letitia Wright the lead of the movie. As it is she is just one of way too many characters that don't really have anything to do until the end. But by then we really don't care because there's already been a Phantom Menace level of boring drawn out dialogue. At least Phantom Menace was in English. Half the boring dialogue is in subtitles, and half of that is...oh, you speak my language?!? Worst Marvel movie ever."
10," One of the BEST Marvel Movies! A Must See Movie!
",adriansanchezjr,/user/ur134523606/,13 November 2022,"Such an amazing emotional fantastic action packed movie! Take the family, young and old to see this one. From the moment the movie begins as well as the ending you can feel the emotional and touching tribute to the late great Chadwick Boseman. Watching the incredible cast each going through their own personal journey of dealing with the loss of their King and the Black Panther and also dealing with a new threat from the awesome beautifully depicted underwater kingdom of Talokan led by the imposing Namor the sub mariner. Watching Shuri dealing with the loss of her brother and the stages of grief was truly gut wrenching at times as you can feel her pain and anger. Angela Bassett provided an academy award performance in the strong powerful her portrayal of Queen Ramonda. All the supporting cast have their moments to shine during the movie as the runtime is the 2nd longest in the MCU after Avenger's Endgame. The new characters were a welcomed treat and I can't wait to see more of them on future Disney + series. As a Marvel fan, you will be taken on an incredibly personal journey of loss and also a loving tribute of the beloved Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of this character and all he meant to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Wakanda Forever X!"
7," A Good Movie
",shahabvaziri-96075,/user/ur123930996/,13 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever was a good movie. It had a lot of potential. The plot dug a lot of holes, but I think it made up for it with the action. The protagonist was really cool actually. I kind of liked him more than the other characters that were good. His childhood story was very interesting. I almost wish I stayed for the after-credits. The music in this movie was very good. It had members of the audience singing along. I don't remember much from the first movie, if anything at all. I actually don't think I watched the first movie all the way through. The bad guys of the film were actually very similar to Native Americans, which is unusual as usually in a film with Native Americans, the Native Americans are the good guys."
8," Action, music, development, and emotion
",Olsenc34,/user/ur70307351/,13 November 2022,"The movie dives deep into emotion. Every character you knew before and those you didn't, you connect with deeply. The emotional growth of the characters takes exceptional leaps and makes you care about them and in turn their story. The story of a war over not wanting war. Vibranium drives two opposing nations to defend it from everyone else. Namor is intimidating and mythological. A powerful ""god"" come to life willing to go to any lengths to defend his people. Tenoch Heurta is a marvel to watch and get to know. Atlantis is a mysterious beauty but somewhat dark and less colorful than expected. The rest of the movie however has some beautiful cinematography and color. We get closer to Wakanda than ever with it's people, it's way of life, it's military, and it's leadership. The action is fierce. The movements, the powers, and weaponry makes every sseauence a thrill. The music makes nearly every scene special. Its unique variety adds so much to the experience. The Compelling performances from the main characters make this an gratifying sendoff to Chadwick. A thoroughly enjoyable ride with plenty of surprises that make it worth the watch. Much better than it's predecessor."

",dawnguest,/user/ur40208912/,13 November 2022,What an awesome film. Absolutely loved it. Story line was on point and the acting was amazing. Very entertaining. Definitely a film that empowers women. Always adore the positive image of Women in the film. I am not a fan of films that are almost three hours. What was too long were the previews. After the film stated the action carried itself. Right on point. I appreciated the cinematography effects and the set design and costumes. The opening scene Aka funeral was so powerful. Beautiful to watch. There is nothing that I didn't enjoy in the film. I actually enjoyed it more than the original. See it for yourself. ðŸ˜Š A #wakandaforever.
8," Wakanda Forever??????
",kalimafoster,/user/ur158774265/,13 November 2022,"I loved the tribute to Chadwick within this movie and all of the actors we're superb! However Marvel, I'm disappointed the plot exposing Wakanda's main resource of vibranium also in other countries, and needing an Allie was very disheartening. The strength of Wakanda and it's people and leading as number one in technology and strength and overall dexterity in maintaining peace and strengthening its people as an African American super hero is awesome and should be maintained at all costs without outside Allies. It would have also been nice to see some lost footage of Chadwick that was not used in part one. Hopefully, the next movie will display those as a tribute to him."
4," I felt like I was watching a video game
",fuzzhead72,/user/ur0922889/,13 November 2022,"The first half of the movie seemed rather slow, while many parts of the second half were frenetic to the point where I suddenly felt like I was watching a Michael Bay movie about robots spinning around all over the place as eye candy. I have never watched a Marvel movie before and felt so much like I was watching a video game, instead of a movie. I found the unnecessary chase scenes in the city to be rather boring and predictable. On the plus side, while at first I was a bit confused about why Namor didn't look like he always has in the comics, I'll admit that I kind of like how they integrated a Mayan background for him and his people. With so many of them being an aquamarine color, and with the Avatar trailer having just played right before the movie, I kept feeling like part of that movie was invading this one. I found myself not feeling very invested in the outcome of the characters, which usually means that the writing suffers a bit compared to the first movie. And when the end credits started rolling, I found myself thinking ""That's it?"". Which isn't typically what I'm thinking when it has been a satisfying, enjoyable movie."
9," Loved it
",jomtcl,/user/ur17644955/,13 November 2022,This sequel has done justice for the first movie I believe the passing of Chadwick was sad and his sister taking mantle of the throne is well suited if anything it has similar plots with the vibriuim metal and a outsider taking it and the acting is great I definitely see it again the storyline has a build up around the pass of black panther tchila and a build up towards the next chapter in wakada I've waited for this sequel and was not disappointed at all a lot of action and in-depth emotions that is well felt if anything I feel marvel has done well and Chadwick would be proud by the sequel it's definitely good sequel.
10," A reminder of how great the MCU was and a beautiful tribute all in one.
",montoyaesquivela,/user/ur74256296/,13 November 2022,"Wakanda forever renewed my hopes for the future of the MCU, all while driving home how lackluster this phase has felt. Within this movie, I found the most beautiful, thoughtful, and well-weaved tribute I can recall in any form of media. The remembrance of Chadwick Boseman was felt throughout, and the grief for his character T'challa came across as more genuine and human than most emotional content in the franchise.The plot itself was, in my opinion, a vast improvement on the fare Marvel has been giving us of late. The cultures that came to life in the movie felt vibrant and in particular as someone born and raised in Mexico I felt gratified to see my culture represented in such a respectful if not truly deep way.Overall I can recommend to any fan to go and watch this movie, something I could not have said for the MCU in some time."
4," Unfortunately disappointed
",misscdrababy,/user/ur136046474/,13 November 2022,"Disjointed storyline and why no men and no love scenes or interest just a whole lot of nothing was disappointed. I speak of the men because the first instalment of black panther had a masculine energy aIongside the female warriors this one was just ALL women, I needed the balance and was disappointed with that. I liked the tribute to Chadwick Boseman though the film in general failed to capture my heart.I did find myself willing the film to end, it was way too long to which you don't normally experience when a film is authentic and genuinely good; this film just was not enough overall meh and wooden. I also found myself thinking where are we going with this and the Queen and Shuri annoyed me to which I won't divulge but if you do see this film you should/will know what I mean."

This was like nothing I ever seen, So Freaking Beautiful. The Tribute to Chadwick Boseman was beautiful! I cried numerous times during this movie. This was A GREAT MOVIE!

9," The silence speaks volumes
",chriscarlisle25,/user/ur45419304/,13 November 2022,"I must admit, I was so hesitant to go see this movie for so long, but I knew I had to go see it for Chadwick Boseman and, it surpassed all of my expectations honestly. This movie perfectly memorializes Chadwick Boseman and allows his memory to live on. It is a true testament to his character and his hard work and perseverance, and you can really see how much he affected the set, tone, and cast of this movie. It really is the silence that hits the emotions the most and just seeing his presence on the screen knowing that he isn't here physically anymore. This movie truly did him justice and I commend each and every person who worked on this movie as this is one of the few movies I have actually clapped for at the end. Speaking of the end, there is a nice little surprise for everyone! I hope that certain people understand the meaning of this movie and we'll see it as the true masterpiece it is, as it covers so many different bases and emotions. It is quite possibly the only superhero movie that truly humanizes the characters and shows The human experience of morning, grief, moving on, and overcoming suffering and a need for vengeance. It is awesome to see namor finally make his big screen appearance as well, the first mutant is finally here and I can't wait to see what his future is like in the MCU.I will say that people who are used to super showy superhero films where everybody has powers and such will be a little disappointed if you cannot sit through a movie that has great emotional depth and storytelling. This movie should be at the next Oscars.Chadwick Boseman is still greatly missed over 3 years since his untimely passing. I truly hope he is getting the rest he deserves and that we see him again someday. Thank you Ryan coogler and company for your tremendous work on this beautiful film."
5," Weak Weaker Weakest, Wakanda
",mounishyalamarthi,/user/ur134773354/,13 November 2022,"Made me fall asleep at few scenes. A mixture of emotions and drama but weak in plot and story building. Wakanda looks super weak without a king and with little princess panther, it's rubbish. Villain is super powerful, Wakanda barely survives. Really ditched this sequel, could have added a new panther. This movie is no longer a black panther or real human movie, they just made it as another super hero. Unbelievable fight scenes and a kingdom without a king made it look like a cartoon movie. Start and end was just a tribute to Chadwick. There is no point of having Angela Bassett in this movie. Everyone gave their best, it's nice to see some new faces, and technology but too slow of a movie. Hope to see some real action in next sequel."
10," Good & emotional story
",ghurd8,/user/ur58583255/,13 November 2022,"Ryan & the writers know how to tell a story. There was nothing formulaic about this except the 3 act structure which alot of movies don't seem to have time for anymore.Everyone plays their part perfectly. Nobody drags the movie down. It's way more emotional than I prefer but how could it not be. There's still some moments of humor but they are few and far in between & subtle. It flows with the story & doesn't distract from it like alot of MCU movies lately.Shuri gets the best individual story arc in one movie in the entire MCU. Didn't expect that litte twist with her. But it was an excellent way to do that scene without T'Challa & shows just how great a job Ryan Coogler does with this terrible circumstance. And how creative him & the writing team were with this movie. They could've shortened the movie by using Ramonda & cutting straight to the point about not letting your grief consume you but they gave us something different. Something a bit more exciting in my mind.The only thing I didn't like were the visuals. Most of the night scenes & all of the murky water scenes were a bit difficult to make out. It could've just been the theater I attended. I think I get why it was done (maybe tonally?) but I'd rather they just make it easier on my eyes.As an aside, I'm disappointed in how Marvel did T'Challa. I get the terrible circumstance of Chadwick's passing (43 YEARS OLD!) but the character was too important to kill off. I also felt his character took a backseat in his own movie to N'Jadaka & the Dora Milaje. They were great but his arc was mostly about them & his father. It could've been more about him like Shuri had here in Wakanda Forever. Maybe that post credit scene will offer redemption to the T'Challa character/name in the future of the MCU. Here's hoping."

9," Extremely emotional and powerful film about grief; best Marvel movie since Endgame
",parksiet,/user/ur73501762/,13 November 2022,"""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is a beautiful and poignant film about grief made by grieving people. I adored this film, not just for how well it honours and continues the legacy of the great Chadwick Boseman, but also how it truly felt like a natural progression from the first film. Ryan Coogler really had his work cut out for him with this film, and frankly was put in quite the impossible situation with the passing of Boseman. I am blown away at how skillfully he overcame these challenges and pivoted the story to a place that is obviously different from what we would all expect coming out of the first ""Black Panther"", and yet feels like a very natural and logical next step at the same time. Not only that, but this also feels like a return to form for the MCU after so long; this is the type of Marvel movie I fell in love with. Don't get me wrong, I have still liked (and in some cases, loved) most of Phase 4, but this film is easily the best Marvel has been since ""Endgame"". While my personal favourite of phase 4 still remains ""No Way Home"", this is a very close second to that. Films like ""Endgame"" and ""No Way Home"" were absolute triumphs, but Wakanda Forever is MCU's most beautiful, meaningful and soulful movie. It is on the level of the first ""Black Panther"" for me, and while it may not be as culturally significant, it only enhances my enjoyment and appreciation of that first film.This movie is an extremely moving and impactful experience. As I said, it is a film about grief and coming to terms with loss, even partially dealing with themes of faith. The movie is really about Shuri's emotional journey of coming to terms with the loss of T'Challa and I found that the focus on grief through the eyes of Shuri was portrayed beautifully. The denial, the anger, and finally the acceptance, was a powerful emotional journey that was needed not only by the characters of the film, but also the audience as well. It is a very emotional watch right from the opening scene. As soon as the film began it caught me off guard with the wave of emotions it made me feel, I definitely cried multiple times throughout this movie. And so did the rest of the audience. People always talk about the memorable theatre moments in these Marvel movies where people clap and cheer. But there were two bookends of absolute, respectful, beautiful silence during this movie that will always define my memory of seeing this for the first time. This silence was unlike anything I have ever witnessed in a theatre, and it really speaks to the powerful way that the film dealt with the loss of Chadwick and T'Challa. The tribute it pays to Chadwick is wonderful and made me feel a lot, but luckily that isn't where the emotions stop. The whole film is emotionally rich, with some tragic undertones throughout the film, so prepare yourself! I love films like this that tell a good story and really make you feel the emotion of it all, it speaks to how well the film works and connects with its audience.""Wakanda Forever"" is easily the best directed and most emotionally rich film in the MCU, possibly even the most cinematic film in the MCU. In terms of directorial voice and style, this is easily the most tactile, soulful, and well-crafted MCU movie since ""Black Panther"". From the costumes to the score, everything is stunningly well crafted, and it handles its themes and tribute to Chadwick flawlessly. One of the things I appreciated most about it was that despite the movies (and tragedies) in between, it does feel like a direct continuation of Coogler's first ""Black Panther"" movie and the characters, themes, and aesthetics he developed in it. It still feels insular. Despite all the real life complications and a plot filled with new characters and world building, it still feels cohesive. The movie feels like it was written and directed by a storyteller not a committee. There are a few issues with the script, it can be clunky at times and there are points that you can tell it was hastily re-written, albeit re-written with love. This isn't Coogler's fault, the tragedy of Chadwick's passing really complicated this movie's production, and Coogler being able to pull off the pivot he did is nothing short of a miracle. So really, a few script issues aside, this film is masterful.Story-wise I loved so many of the choices Coogler made, from the way he weaved in history and politics in relation to Wakanda and its resources on a global stage, to the handling of the Black Panther, to the introduction of Namor and Talokan. I loved the way he mirrored T'Challa's arc in ""Civil War"" for Shuri here, it felt very poetic. She has one of the best emotional character arcs in the MCU in this film! The continuation of Shuri's journey felt very natural, I loved what he did with Queen Ramonda, the return of Nakia is very gratifying, and even the return of Martin Freeman's Everett Ross gave this a strong continuity with the first film and within the MCU. The newer elements, like Riri Williams and Namor, both of which I loved, are also added in a way that feels very organic. I was afraid that much of the movie would feel like Phase 5 pandering and inserted green screen reshoots with cameos, but thank god, the whole thing feels like a singular vision. This is a Ryan Coogler movie through and through! Namor especially stole the show for me, the depiction of Namor is so excellent it hurts. The movie treats him like a mythic icon and a terrifying foe, making me really wish ""Love and Thunder"" did more of this with Gorr. I loved how Coogler established Talokan and Namor's backstory, it was richly written and even sublimely tackled the effects of colonialism we still see in the world today. The movie truly nailed Namor's introduction, his arc is clear, his motivations are clear and most importantly understandable and he has instantly become one of the best MCU villains to date.I think it's probably completely natural for ""Wakanda Forever"" to hit people differently. The movie deserves a lot of credit for executing a great cinematic experience, and what is most important is that it is sure of itself, and feels so carefully crafted to accomplish what it wants to. As much as I want to see Coogler working outside the MCU, I really hope he makes one more ""Black Panther"" movie to round out the trilogy. These two films flow like a singular vision made with passion and care. I'd love to see a conclusive third film from Coogler and his team!The technical side of this film is complete perfection, and when it comes back to it this movie is likely one of the best from a technical filmmaking standpoint in the MCU, much like the first one also was. First off, what really struck me was the incredible costume design from Ruth Carter. She did a wonderful job with the Afro-futuristic styles in the first film to establish the world of Wakanda, and brings them back in fresh but familiar ways here! For ""Wakanda Forever"" she wonderfully borrowed styles from Meso-American cultures to help create the world of Talokan. The production design by Hannah Beachler was also really well done in fleshing out these worlds, I really have to say some of the strongest features about the two ""Black Panther"" films are this artistry on display in terms of costumes, sets, hair, makeup, and everything else that really makes the world of Wakanda feel so much more tangible. The movie looks and sounds great. There's a grandeur to the imagery matched with intimacy behind the camera that makes it feel so real and raw. Coogler upped his game significantly in the visuals and it's amazing what happens when they give VFX a proper timetable, because for the most part the CGI looks great! And I loved the look of the action scenes, especially Namor's attack on Wakanda as well as the 3rd act climax, which I thought really felt like it tread some new ground for Marvel! It has big CGI action, but also some great story beats and character moments to it!What was my favourite aspect of the movie though? Of course it has to be Ludwig Goransson's score! He brought back old themes, created new ones, and once again proves he is one of the most interesting composers today! I loved the musical continuity between this and the first film, it is likely the best example of it in the MCU, and I would even say these two films have the best musical scores in the MCU save for maybe the ""Avengers"" films. The sound mix was incredible and I loved the creative ways Ludwig was able to use his music in the film; it really took my breath away! Also while on the topic of sound, I thought the way they handled subtitles was quite clever! The film has lots of languages and the fact that they use different fonts and colours to distinguish them (and some moments use the difference between languages as a dramatic beat) is something that I just find really neat and cool!Continuing my praise of this film, the acting on display is pitch perfect, and really elevates everything off of the pages of the script! Tenoch Huerta was flawless as Namor, he embodied the character perfectly and especially since this is one of his first major Hollywood films, proves he has the capability to be a great talent in the industry going forward. Letitia Wright was asked to do a lot more in this film over her role in the first, taking on the leading role, and she actually gave a brilliant performance. I was so impressed with the emotions on display, as well as her ability to get the audience to back her character! She really proved she can be a leading actress, especially impressive after being thrown into it so quickly! Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke were both fantastic also, but I just wish they had more to do, and Dominique Thorne was instantly likable as Riri Williams! The true standout of the movie for me, however, was of course Angela Bassett as Queen Ramonda. She commanded the screen in all of her scenes, showcasing waves of emotion in her powerful performance."
8," Would have been 10/10 if they had focused just on Shuri and Namor
",Grey_rainbow,/user/ur103187240/,13 November 2022,"Black Panther 2 is easily the best MCU movie this year, so don't miss it.What worked for me:
1) Shuri: Given how the recent Strange and Thor have been utterly ruined, I was quite skeptic on whether she can carry Black Panther's mantle. But she and the writers have done a terrific job. She is now the perfect Black Panther and there is no other female superhero in MCU that comes close to her right now.2) Namor, Talokan and underwater people: Like Killmonger, here too the ""villain"" is very well written. I was rooting for him more than I did for Killmonger in part-1 and was wishing for him and his people to not lose or die. The underwater people are a force to reckon with. I am eager to see them more in the next movies.3) Of course, the main story and character arcs. They were beautiful and will stay with you long after the movie ends.What didn't work:
1) The girl in iron suit: Didn't work even for a second and she was a big misfit in the whole movie.2) Martin Freeman: I never got why there is even Martin Freeman here other than to be called a colonizer (I am still not 100% with those jokes either and I am not Caucasian, if you are wondering).3) Julia Dreyfus: Her character is literally pointless in the movie and her villainy is as transparent and cheesy as that of the villains in campy superhero shows of 80s. Again, a big misfit in a world where even all the big villains aren't black, but quite grey.BTW, the things that didnt work didnt stop me from enjoying the movie. They were minor annoyances in a very engrossing story. They didn't distract me enough to think about them for even a minute.When I left the theater, after greatly disappointed with Thor and Strange movies, I felt a new hope for MCU. Hope Dinsey doesn't ruin it for the sake of their mostly horrendous shows."
3," Good movie for movie likers - Bad for me as Marvel-Fan (Disappointed)
",Draidy,/user/ur81674292/,13 November 2022,"First ever doing a review, but felt like I had too.For any movie likers, this is a good movie.But for me, as a marvel-fan, im kind of disappointed.Not including Michael B. Jordan as the new Black Panther was for me, a huge mistake. Having Shuri to replace as BP doesnt seem fitting for me at all. First of all, she hasnt showed any kind of combat skills during the franchise or what so ever. She literally gets combat skills after absorbing the heart-shaped herb.She also decides to leave her throne away in the end, and ofc Jabari is going to get it.In my opinion, reincarnation of. Killmonger would have been better. We dont necessarily have to see the whole thing during the move, and leave it as a shock when he appeares during the fight, to duell versus. Namor. Audience spoke way before that they found MBJ as best replacement for BP, but yet again, no one is listening and they decided to take the worse path.In general, movie is slow. Has some great combats and the storyline is decent. CGI has not improved.This movie should have been done way better, in reminder of Chadwick Boseman. Im truly disappointed."
10," IT'S AWESOME !!
",baharrulgerr,/user/ur153082150/,13 November 2022,"It was one of the best movie. The way they showed their respect to the Chadwick Boseman and everyone had to shut up because how silent the movie got suddenly ! I do not know what to say it was just so good. They showed women power, they showed us the power of intelligence. How hard you can try, how hard you can lose. Marvel did lots of really good movies but this one was touching differently. I really do not know what everyone was expecting but it is so funny of saying DC movies are getting better than Marvel. There was story of everyone in this movie. There was deep emotions. It was 2 hours movie but made me think about so many things for hours just by making me feel deeply about all the characters in the movie. So thank you to everyone whoever involved of making it."
7," You have two choices: you can come to Wakanda conscious, or unconscious.
",reddiemurf81,/user/ur27018907/,12 November 2022,"At the beginning of the movie we see Shuri frantically working in her lab.We hear Shuri's A. I. announce that
King T'Challa's heart rate has dropped to a dangerously low level. We see the princess (obviously upset/distraught) tell her A. I. to print a sample, saying it is probably the last chance she has to save her brother.As the sample finishes printing, Shuri turns to the door to see her mother, Queen Ramonda,, who tells her that the king (her brother) has died.The following scene shows the Wakandan funeral ceremony for the deceased King. Okoye, and the other royal guards act as the pallbearers, carrying the King's coffin thru the capital streets, followed closely by the Queen and Princess (dressed in white, Wakandan mourning clothes). The people sing, dance, cry/wail, observe the ceremony in the own fashion. M'baku and his people also stand there in honor of King T'Challa. (The whole first 5 mins or so was a huge send off to the late actor who brought the character of Black Panther to life. It was really moving and well done. Marvel was right not to recast)Then the screen goes to black,, and we see - ONE YEAR LATER,,,We cut a scene at the United Nations, where Queen Ramonda enters, escorted by her guard. The topic being discussed is how Wakanda has failed to share their resources with the rest of the world. Namely, their vibranium.Shuri has drowned herself in her tech development, and has spent her time doing anything but trying to think about her brother's death. In her words (to her mother, who tries to help her mourn/move on) - ""if I spend too much time thinking about my brother, and how he was taken from us,, I'll burn the whole world down.""As the princess and queen are speaking by the oceanside,, the suddenly realize they are not alone. A man appears from underneath the water. A man with pointed ears and feathered wings connected to his ankles. He announces that his friends call him Ku'klan,, but his enemies refer to him as Namor, and he is the King of his people. He informs the two that nations from around the world have begun searching for vibranium outside of Wakanda. That his underwater kingdom has vibranium, just like Wakanda. Namor's people have encountered scientists drilling within their kingdom, and discovered that an American scientist has developed technology to extract vibranium when it is found. Namor tells the Princess and Queen to find the American Scientist, and to bring them to him. If not, he and his army will lay waste to Wakanda.Imo, they handled the death of both the actor & character extremely well.All the Wakandan characters (Shuri, Okoye, Nakia, Ramonda, M'baku) go through quite the emotional journey in this movie dealing with the death of T'Challa and the new threat.The Namor actor plays his part extremely well also. A formidable foe to say the least.Visually, the movie is as, if not more, spectacular as the first.Overall, I enjoyed the movie,, although there are some things in the movie that aggravated me,,,"
10," A great emotional story
",ghurd8,/user/ur58583255/,12 November 2022,"Ryan & the writers know how to tell a story. There was nothing formulaic about this except the 3 act structure which alot of movies don't seem to have time for anymore.Everyone plays their part perfectly. Nobody drags the movie down. It's way more emotional than I prefer but how could it not be. There's still some moments of humor but they are few and far in between & subtle. It flows with the story & doesn't distract from it like alot of MCU movies lately.Shuri gets the best individual story arc in one movie in the entire MCU. Didn't expect that litte twist with her. But it was an excellent way to do that scene without T'Challa & shows just how great a job Ryan Coogler does with this terrible circumstance. And how creative him & the writing team were with this movie. They could've shortened the movie by using Ramonda & cutting straight to the point about not letting your grief consume you but they gave us something different. Something a bit more exciting in my mind.The only thing I didn't like was the visuals. Almost all the night scenes & anything in the water was a little difficult to make out. It may have just been the particular theater I attended. And I get the murky water scenes added ""realism"" but that's the last thing I come to the MCU for. I think I understand why it was done (maybe tonally) but I'd just rather they make it easier on my eyes.As an aside, I'm disappointed in the way T'Challa was done in the MCU. As terrible as the circumstances were with Chadwick(43years old!), the character was too important to kill off this soon. That & I felt he took a backseat in his own movie to N'Jadaka & the Dora Milaje. They were great but his arc could have been more about him like Shuri had in Wakanda Forever. Maybe that post credit scene will lead to redemption for the name T'Challa in the future of the MCU. Here's hoping."
9," Chadwick was missed, but they still delivered
",quieria,/user/ur111961177/,12 November 2022,"The imagery, the portrayal of Black people was masterful!! The costume design was phenomenal. A young, black woman as a STEM prodigy was a fantastic character to inspire young girls. Angela Bassett deserves all of her flowers. She has played a lot of iconic roles and she didn't disappoint as Queen Ramonda. She has buried her husband and son and had to lead a nation that is constantly being preyed upon by Colonizers. Namor as a villain or anti-hero was perfect. You want to hate him, but his motives were pure. He just wanted the same thing Wakandas wanted: to protect his world from Vibranium poachers. Having Shuri have visions of Killmonger was a surprise! Glad to see how she melded his vision with T'Challa's.My only complaint is that for all they did to protect Bucky, they could've tapped Sebastian Stan to come film for the funeral scene."
10," Black Panther Lives On
",essensmusic,/user/ur158770615/,12 November 2022,"I'm appalled by the emotion in this movie. The action is breath taking, and the story line is impeccable!! I couldn't stop glaring with a sense of hope and pride with my fists balled tight in many scenes in this movie! Ryan Has done again. What an amazing film director with an amazing team. I didn't think it would be as good as the first one but was I wrong. The acting in this movie moved me. Definitely the best move I've watched this year by far!!! I want to watch again already. I pride myself off being strict when it come to rating movies. Black Panther 2 did it for me. Peace love and blessings! Nothing less than 10/10 ðŸ–¤"
6," Black panther 2 was just ok
",Kingofthehill00,/user/ur68066207/,12 November 2022,"Black panther started with covering Chadwicks death. It was very respectful and the director covered it so well but the movie itself was very mediocre and boring. I feel the plot had elements which were good,I liked the idea of a new race,the villain,the introduction of Mayan gods in the MCU.the characters growth each of them,it was good.But the movie made me feel sad and bored to be honest and I will tell you why.They chose to cover Chadwicks death and later the queen dies,too much death in a single movie.They made the choice to make Shuri the black panther,which was a very poor choice in my opinion. Shuri was introduced as a tech savy genius character ,she didn't possess the charisma for a role like that. She still felt like a sidekick for the main character.i am not against woman being a black panther but whoever dons the suit must be able to have the charisma.i liked black panther because Chadwick had that with the way he delivered monologues to the way he was ,God rest his soul but choosing her was a bad choice
The movie was very long and the buildup was very slow. Even the monologue at the end ""vegeance has consumed you and I am done letting it consume me"" which was delivered by Chadwick in civil war could have been used here...such a good opportunity but wasted.Even the cgi was boring,the Ironman suit looked so ugly there.There was barely any fight scenes and the movie was just depressing all around
I get why it's getting such high praise from critics and all but this movie isn't a fun movie for the average person.The MCU is slowly going to lose their fanbase at this rate with Thor and now this.Anyway all good things must end I suppose."
9," You can't base your feelings on this movie on the absence of Chadwick Boseman
",ViciousCXY,/user/ur107044783/,12 November 2022,"I've seen a few lower ratings where the biggest reason for the rating seems to be the absence of Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther; to rate your feelings on this film based on him not physically being there is just unfair. He and everyone else involved didn't really have much of a choice for him not to be in it. So what was the other options? Never make another Black Panther film? Deep fake him for the rest of his MCU appearances?This sequel was a great tribute to Chadwick. A great sequel overall. And for me personally, I might prefer it based mostly around the villain(s).There were a lot of unfair comments based around the actor playing Namor before anyone actually got to see him portray the character. Mostly based around his looks. In my opinion, he did a great job at portraying this character; you could empathise with him and his people, whilst they also came across as very intimidating and pretty spooky at times. Also Namor is actually very easy on the eyes if I do say so myself ðŸ˜ŒRiri Williams didn't irk the way people made her out she would, obviously basing their initial opinions on the comic version of her which is fair. But she came across as pretty grounded and likeable to me.The soundtrack was fantastic and I have no complaints in terms of VFX. The actors' performances were top notch as to be expected.So generally, no complaints from me. Marvel chose a great film to end Phase 4 ðŸ‘�ðŸ�»"
10," Loved it.
",gotmay,/user/ur68340752/,12 November 2022,"Was always going to be challenging to deliver a second movie without Chadwick Boseman. However they did a fantastic job at honoring him and continuing to develop the story. The Queen was incredible and really carried the story along. Her poise and strength was fantastic , as were many of the performances. It balanced loss with humour , which is no easy thing to do. Aside from the great acting , the fight scenes and cinematography were excellent. There were even a few scenes which almost had me in tears of both joy and sadness. I am really glad they brought many of the characters back and developed them a bit more. If you liked the first , I would highly recommend this one also. Loved it."
3," Boring
",ektorble,/user/ur95008089/,12 November 2022,The movie was a bust. It's plot is just so boring and non sence that it actually makes the movie boring to watch and uninteresting. In my opinion marvel don't produce films with love anymore. They just try to make a movie that it will be profitable and make them money. Also the jokes and the humour in this movie is beyond stupid and unfunny. The acting is neither good nor bad. Some of the actors are acting really good others are just boring to watch and don't actually fit their role. The CGI was really good and fun to watch. The movie could have ended in 1:30 hours but the movie producers thought that 2 and a half about hours aren't enough for a marvel movie.
5," Talocan forever!
",RogerRoger77,/user/ur125452593/,12 November 2022,"Enough has been said by other reviewers about the film's overall weaknesses - it's overlong, meandering and drags in many places. Instead, I want to focus on a question no one else seems to be asking: what is up with these Wakandans?I was a definite fan of the first movie, but as the sequel progressed, I found myself more and more annoyed (and irritated) by the film's semi-religious Wakandaphilia. Frankly, the constant self-adulation and smug sense of exceptionalism displayed by every Wakandan character really started to grate. After a while, what I'm sure the film-makers see as a message of empowerment starts to sound a lot like fascistic aggrandizement. If this degree of messianic self-love were displayed by characters in any other (real) country, it would be dismissed as overblown nationalism.Let's not forget, as the film itself points out, Wakanda is a superpower - possibly the most powerful nation on earth, thanks to its stocks of 'vibranium' - so it's difficult to swallow the idea that they are also somehow persecuted victims. Add to this the fact that they jealously try to preserve their monopoly of this most valuable resource, and its associated technology, and its hard not to see Wakanda as just another arrogant and self-interested power.Indeed, after a while, my sympathies shifted much more to the rival Talocans, who with some justification came to see Wakanda as more of a threat than an ally. Maybe the next movie could be called Talocan Forever, and show their side of the story instead."
8," 7.8 Wakanda Forever Indeed
",beavecoon1,/user/ur44879395/,12 November 2022,This movie respects the late great Chadwick Boseman amazingly. From the opening scene it gives you gut wrenching performances from the actors that feel real pain from his loss. We lost an icon when we lost Chadwick Boseman and they did him justice.Shuri (Letita Wright) owns her role in this movie. She has raw and powerful emotions that come to us when we lose people. Namor is pretty cool. This plot suffered a bit imo from predictable twists toward the end. The action is great throughout the movie but the final fight was just okay. Overall a great movie and one of my favorites from Phase 4 of the MCU.
10," Well done!
",creativehavenfarms,/user/ur109768868/,12 November 2022,This movie did indeed pay homage to Chadwick Boseman. But it moved beyond that by giving all the characters depth and richness. The storyline was solid and there was definitely plenty of action. I didn't know what to expect as the trailer had been somewhat cryptic. I was delightfully surprised with the quality of this movie. It wraps up Phase Four quite well leaving us to wonder what's next for Black Panther and Wakanda. The movie also deals with the issue of grief in a multi layered fashion. I'm really glad I watched it and I want to see it again. It most assuredly did not disappoint in any way at all.
9," My fears that it would be inferior to the first film were groundless.
",Carycomic,/user/ur2216443/,12 November 2022,"This sequel begins with a montage of images featuring the late, great Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa. After which, we get an opening sequence that alternates between a special meeting of the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, and a Wakandan cultural outreach center in Mali, North Africa.The juxtaposition (always wanted to use that word!) between Queen Ramonda's defiant speech (to the mostly Caucasian diplomats) and the kick-butt fight (between the mercenaries and the Dora Milaje) is awesome. Showing to movie-goers like me that Wakanda does not make empty threats when it comes to defending their autonomy.Then comes the dramatic foreshadowing of the Homo mermani when a vibranium-prospecting crew (working for the CIA) get massacred. That literally had me on the edge of my seat wondering whether or not there would be even one survivor! But, I was to be slightly disappointed in that regard. Which is too bad, considering the prospecting supervisor was played by Lake Bell (who played the marine biologist on that one-season wonder NBC called ""Surface"" back in 2005)!I won't spoil the rest of the film for those who haven't seen it, yet. Well, except for three things. The return of everyone else from the first Black Panther film. The introduction of Riri ""Ironheart"" Williams (a child prodigy probably smarter than Tony Stark and Peter Parker, put together). And Namor's comic book origin (half-Scottish/half-Atlantean) getting thrown to the way side, here. Instead, we get the mutant son of a 16th-century Mayan princess whose people were magically mutated by the bioluminescent algae equivalent of Wakanda's Heart-shaped Herb!*Otherwise, Tenoch Huerta does a pretty decent job portraying the Submariner as an anti-hero. And the climactic fight scene aboard the Sea Leopard is suitably (for lack of a better term) super.I highly recommend all my fellow friends of Marvel to going to go see it . They won't be disappointed.*That is the only reason I give it nine-out-of-ten stars."
9," Beautiful and emotional
",hcarnie,/user/ur147381181/,12 November 2022,"An emotional journey, beautifully done. The exceptional cast, moved me to tears multiple times. Twice from sadness once from joy (no spoilers! Haha) The sold out theatre on opening night not only applauded but many had tears they were trying to wipe away.It is a 3 hour movie but it didn't feel that way to me, I was engaged every step of the way and eager to see the journey.Black panther movies continue to excel in the marvel universe. The way they showcase two cultures that are entirely from the comics, using cultural clothing, languages, building sets and gorgeous visuals really make you feel they are real. The strong female characters in this movie are bada$s and show the struggle to be a force for good in this world (a world that doesn't make that easy!).Well done! (Fyi: one end credit scene)"
8," The royal vengence
",rajvignesh-60140,/user/ur144838273/,12 November 2022,"Oh boy, its been one hell of a movie, a different approach from marvel, the rage emotion revenge vengence and wisdom shown in the movie is enlighted a bit more than its expected. Oh boy what a movie! First kudos to boseman, the black panther he portrayed was the best no one can do that anymore !! This movie is an absolute tribute to him. An osm story and hype throughout, churi omg she is something and every charcter played their roles to perfection the iron heart and the transformation was the highlight cant ask more than this. Every scene at edge of the seat. I expected boseman atleast for one scene but cudnt find him in, but there is a huge surprise in the pc dont miss that i dont want to spoil that. The graphics is always as like never. A really intense screenplay and story and could connect to the characters easily. Black panther will return. Please do watch in theaters."
9," Amazing. Captivating political drama
",rkechols,/user/ur113656397/,12 November 2022,"So good. They did really well given the difficult circumstances of losing Chadwick Boseman. The whole cast really stepped it up and delivered an amazing performance. Really great soundtrack paired with it, too. A redeeming movie for phase 4.Less action and more drama than the typical superhero movie, but that's what gave it so much meaning. Really focuses on character development, feelings, intentions, and family. Powerful messages about loss, grief, anger, pain, compassion, and even finding faith.Surprisingly minimal woke messaging, given its creators (though there was still some, of course)."
5," This movie is a trap
",jczerniecki,/user/ur147170031/,12 November 2022,"Chadwick Boseman died 2 years ago which meant a lot of problems for Disney. Sadly, these problems are very noticeable in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.The movie itself seems to be a good tribute with great music and costumes. I remember the first movie got a lot positive comments about the visuals except the final battle. Here bad CGI is cover by a layer of dark colors. All CGI animals are dark and bland. The result of it is miserable because Wakanda is beautiful but not in BP2, and Namor's home is awful (Atlantis in Aquaman movie is full of colors - ironically, MCU is dark, not DC).Making an overlong movie wasn't a good decision because the story doesn't bring interesting things on the table. Many scenes area unnecessary or boring. The cast seems okay with Angela Bassett as the MVP. A man starring as Namor is good as well. However I don't see him as a better villain/anti-hero than Killmonger. His motivation seems childish or like a caveman. The script doesn't allow the cast to make them full - I find 3 characters are wasted and another 2 are here just to connect Wakanda to big Marvel lore which is empty. I want to say Riri Williams aka new Iron Man is introduced very badly because her presence makes unlikeable. I know some people like her because she is so cool etc but she killed cops and nothing happens.... Ryan Coogler wrote a bad script.The third act is very simple and doesn't land as something we all gonna remember. This mini review doesn't contain spoilers so I will describe it as cheap, lazy, naive and unsatisfying climax. There is one mid-credit scene which makes me sure to forget this movie and wait for Black Panther 3."
9," A beautiful journey taking Marvel to next level.
",turabzaidi-60656,/user/ur120930668/,12 November 2022,"What a movie, it has everything from the start. The emotional side, action, characters everything. What a beautiful movie design of the underworld taking to a whole new level and challenge for avatar. This movie takes Marvel to a big edge over Dc. Dc shiuld learn from it especially Dwayne Johnson thats how you make a movie, even the villains were loveable. This is a big difference between the two worlds. T challa was honoured as it should be. Overall everyone should watch this movie. Skip Thor 4 ðŸ˜‚ and watch this instead. New Black Panther was very well done and honoured. This movie deserves a well done job."
4," Beautiful tribute but the rest was disappointing
",chanel-wade,/user/ur47874391/,12 November 2022,The tribute at the beginning to Chadwick was the best part of the movie. But unfortunately the vast majority of the movie was a let down! I really wanted to like it but let's be honest there was at most 5 minutes of the movie where we actually saw black panther in action. Its like watching spiderman and he doesn't put on his suit until 2 hrs in. I loved Shuri in the first movie but I didn't like how they presented her for most of the movie! This movie felt like a filler episode. The story was dragged out and characters involved just for the sake of it. I wanted more 1:1 action also. Disappointing and wouldn't recommend it.
6," Rating only for the tribute to Chadwick!
",aalimkhan-65443,/user/ur61607911/,12 November 2022,"Movie is slow paced and disconnected. It was hard to connect with the characters and their emotions, there were times where i felt like forwarding the movie and get over with it. There was no need of streching this movie for this long, the same story they could have completed in 120 minutes or even less. I know some might fine my review that i am exaggerating, but trust me this movie is not what it think when you watch the trailer. The plot was weak, there was no anticipation at all. Anyway, the only reason I rated 6 to this movie is just because they tried to pay the tribute to Chadwick Boseman."
5," All the characters are dumb
",dragonakascooter,/user/ur111382031/,12 November 2022,"Could be said for many Marvel movies but many character's decisions, and things happened during the movies did not make logical sense. It made me feel that Wakandans are just incompetent at basic international diplomacy. They sneak into countries and blow things up and wish they'll be nice to you?Also why are they fighting with one ship when they have a whole fleet of things? Why do they only have single sonar thing to protect the ship? Why did one of the blue girl died with an electric shock when the others were pretty much immortal? You can't just make things happen as you wish because it's a super hero movie. It really puts me off."
4," If Namor's mutant power was to bore you to death
",Xieger,/user/ur62363306/,12 November 2022,"Well it looks like Marvel butchered yet another well established character. I've read Namor and watched the early cartoon versions of him for decades. Every iteration of his portrayal were consistent throughout the years... until the MCU's version came out. Much like DC's Ocean Master, he was a haughty self absorbed egoist with a high-nobility way of speech to go along with it. This MCU version is basically as introverted, boring, and quiet as possible. When he threatened to kill a person or destroy the world, he said it with the gusto of reading the dictionary. The infamous ""Imperius Rex"" got replaced with some gibberish I will not bother to learn. Sure the action scenes were all good but that's on the CGI team, not the actor himself. The Atlanteans as a whole got nerfed to hell in this universe, much like the Black Order was in Infinity Wars. The Black Order in the comics were each world destroyers. Proxima Midnight's spear had the weight of a sun that she could lift and throw it at will. They slew armies of Thors like nothing in Battleworld. Yet Black Widow, a normal human, blocked her strikes without becoming a pile of fleshy goo during the Wakanda battle. The same kind of nerf was applied to the Atlanteans in this movie. Even average joe Atlanteans can lift 4 tons because they live in the crushing depths of the oceans. Atlantean warriors are 10 tonners, basically as strong as an elephant. Attuma is an established 60 tonner yet Okoye, yet another normal human, blocked his strikes in fights, without an Iron Woman suit. So I guess either Okoye can block the charge of 6 elephants as well, or Attuma got nerfed to hell in this movie. I'm not even going to touch on how Namor, a 200,000 tonner got beat by Shuri's version of BP. Even weakened, he's as strong as Attuma in the comics and should be able to slap Shuri silly with ease. If DC can portray their Atlanteans accurately, why can't Marvel? DC's average Atlanteans can run through walls and destroy boulders with a punch. Marvel's Atlanteans gets flung and beat by humans. On the Wakanda storyline side, it was ok. The strongest acting came from Angela Bassett. Once she was gone, the acting became Disney Kids shows level."
6," No one can replace Chadwicks acting
",amraakram,/user/ur153075306/,12 November 2022,"Shuri has done a great job but not to the level of expectation. This movie reminds Chadwick bosemen and his sacrifice to protect wakanda.But in overall they failed to show the real black panther show.As a marvel fan what you witness is not enough for you to digest.Only two to three men's are used to show significant power, should have used more male characters in the movieFelt like this movie is dedicated to women than menMarvel promoting feminism, hope marvel will understand that story is what matters than to protect the wakandaIn simple - one villain from sea try to ask help to demolish earth from shuri (black panther sister) - he attacks wakanda - war begins - war ends- movie ends."
6," A Disney movie
",oskarfdez,/user/ur14888983/,12 November 2022,"It took them long but they finally made it. Marvel has lost their punch and it's all about watering stories down. Wakanda gets destroyed but nothing really happens. One wave of a hand and everything is suddenly rebuilt, they are all friends again and living happily ever after. The jokes are a repetition of the first movie (like Okoye saying that people with iPhones are primitive). Also there are character arches that do not make sense at all, like Everett Ross or Namor himself (he wants to kill Riri but once she is at hand he doesn't however he has no problem destroying Wakanda and afterwards he bends the knee?). This movie also felt like the cast hated each other, and Suri did not show chemistry with anyone really. The credit scene felt like a way to get rid of her as black panther in the future.On the other hand there are nice nods to the late Chadwick Boseman and some of the actors (like Angela Basset or Lupita Nyong'o, I also liked Tenoch Huerta) made up in good acting for the gaps in the story.Maybe I was expecting too much but it has definitely disappointed me."
7," Flawed but loving tribute
",masonsaul,/user/ur94560739/,12 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is at its best when it focuses on being a loving tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman that honours his legacy and explores the pain of grief and how to finally move on in some heartbreaking ways.However, it's also frustratingly undermined by too many subplots that don't really go anywhere, confused plotting and a sluggish pace as well as an unnecessary need to set up and tie into other things in the ever expanding MCU. The trademark overbearing humour is restrained but definitely not enough.Letitia Wright rises to meet her uneasy task and gives an incredible lead performance, bringing so much more depth, nuance and emotion to Shuri than ever before and absolutely proving that she is more than capable of being the new lead of this franchise.Angela Bassett and Danai Gurira are both terrific with the most powerful performances of the film. Winston Duke is once again instantly loveable and always a joy to see and Lupita Nyong'o is great but massively underutilized.Tenoch Huerta struggles a little in the shadow of Michael B. Jordan's terrific Killmonger but he still makes Namor a really compelling antagonist with an intimidating presence and more than enough depth, especially for an MCU villain.Ryan Coogler's direction is pretty good overall, the film looks nice with a impressive sense of intimacy for the most part but the action scenes feel bland (apart from a standout car chase early on) and there's a definite overuse of slow motion.As usual the CG is very hit and miss throughout constantly swapping from impressive to poor. Ludwig GÃ¶ransson's score is really good, bringing back all the iconic themes and some solid new pieces and the closing song by Rihanna is extremely heart wrenching and works perfectly."
10," Absolutely loved it!
",nickmccane,/user/ur60552192/,12 November 2022,"I had concerns before seeing this movie. How would they move forward from Chadwick Boseman? How would Letitia Wright respond to being the face of the franchise, What will the storyline be, Who would be the villain, Will it hold my attention, Etc. Well let me say this, they did not disappoint. The tribute was outstanding, great storyline, the villain was awesome, it definitely held my attention, and it did not disappoint. Letitia Wright did her thing too. She makes a great Black Panther. I found myself in love with their country, clothing, and style. I was overwhelmed. Can't wait to watch it again. Wakanda Forever!"

",Xstal,/user/ur4103165/,12 November 2022,"Vibranium's been found beneath the waves, by powers who deceive and misbehave, but extraction has been cut, and their access has been shut, while Wakanda still sheds tears around a grave. A search begins to find the tool designer, the creator of the underwater miner, soon warring factions clash, warrior weapons, spear and flash, ultimatums are unleashed, from the hardliners. An invasion leads to changes at the top, a new beginning means the fighting cannot stop, it's time to ambush, trap and trick, to ensure that wings get clipped, letting water levels cede, and tides to drop.An overwhelming wallop of wonderful Wakandan wizardry, as emotions are pumped to extremes and hopes are dashed along with their dreams. Brilliant performances all round, spectacular imagery with several new doors opened for future ventures.See it in a cinema if you can."
8," A good movie that is worth watching
",chrispapavramidou-24411,/user/ur157454446/,12 November 2022,This movie is good with a lot of depth in characters. According to me the plot presents a very reasonable explanation as it represents a passage between the first movie with Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and a future movie. There is not as much action as in past avenger movies but that to me is very normal because the center of attention is the complexity of all the issues that are risen in Wakanda and in T' Chala's family after he is gone.Generally all the actors deliver a very good performance but personally I really liked Leticia Wright's and Angela Basett's performances. Very sincere and true to their roles. I felt the struggle of the characters and it was very moving to see how Shuri would come to overcome all the physical and mental obstacles and become her best self.A good movie that is worth watching.

",kylethekilt,/user/ur158764523/,12 November 2022,"Film didnt really know what it was meant to be. A whole lot of nothing happens throughout the running time. Predictable, low action and weak storyline.

1," I don't get it
",ocsalevmot,/user/ur34721453/,12 November 2022,"I've really loathed Marvel's post Endgame output and have been on the verge of abandoning their projects altogether (it's hard though...many of these characters and their storylines run deep in my bones). I wasn't a huge fan of the first Black Panther film...didn't hate it, but found it quite middling, particularly the direction of the film, which I found a bit odd as I was quite a fan of the other Coogler films I'd seen. The thing that worked for me in the first one was Bozeman himself, who played T'Challa with such charisma and force that he carried the day in spite of its other flaws (Michael B. Jordan was great too). Given these things I had half a mind to avoid this altogether, but was so moved by the emotion of the trailer and the apparent funerary and elegiacal nature of the film that I just had to watch. If nothing else, I wanted to see these artists pour their hearts into honoring their friend.That being said, I really want to be sensitive and considerate in my remarks on this issue, because my first problem with this film was with that very matter. The elegy that was this movie, just did not connect with me. I believe these artists wanted to honor him and worked hard to make something great and, it seems, that in the estimation of many, they accomplished that, but emotion is a very subjective thing and, for me, there just wasn't any (or very little at least).It's not that the film seemed insincere, rather it's that it failed aesthetically. Case in point: consider the prelude during T'Challa's funeral, during his final send off. A Wakandan ship flies above the bier and tractor beams the coffin up into its nave, flying away immediately after. What a very odd choice. Pretty much all people throughout history have done one of two things as a culmination to a funerary rite: they either bury (on land or at sea) or cremate the body. Any other choice (especially the one they landed on) is going to elicit one of two responses: 1. Laughter at the absurdity of it or 2. Confusion as to the why of it. I didn't laugh on account of the solemnity and sincerity of the moment (although it struck me as an extremely odd choice) but I was very confused and it completely took me out of the moment. I found my mind wandering to questions about where they were taking him, about why his loved ones weren't with him, as well as the whats, wherefores, and whys of Wakandan burial practices. These things interrupt what should be the central goal of the scene, which is to let the viewer mourn along with everyone else.While there were some affecting bits in the funeral scene (particularly the slow mo dancing at the terminus of the procession), the whole thing mostly felt rushed due to some clumsy and choppy editing. Also, the hue of the sequence (and the whole movie really) was so ugly. I get that it was meant to be dreary and that the light should've been a bit muted, but it looked bad...as bad as anything I've seen Marvel put out.Also, the decision to kill off Queen Ramonda seemed really ill advised. I get that you need to create a story arc whereby Shuri comes into her own in taking on the mantle of the Black Panther, but killing her mother seems like a relentless (and unnecessary) cruelty to her character, but even more important is that it set up a really unfortunate contrast with the central emotive purpose of the movie. Chadwick Bozeman died. For real. And part of what made us all feel so much about the loss of King T'Challa was the reality undergirding the fiction. To then include another fictional death, seemed so wrong. How could it possibly do anything but take you out of the narrative of the movie by making you keenly aware that it was fake...not at all real...and that Angela Basset is very much still with us today? It seemed in poor taste to me, and it was unnecessary...they could've given a different narrative device to undergird Shuri's arc.I feel genuinely bad criticizing something that clearly was and is meaningful to people...particularly people who would've been close to Bozeman and had a real relationship to him. On that account, I want to be careful and try to moderate my response and acknowledge that this was no doubt a meaningful approach for many people, including the feelings of those who matter the most, but it didn't work for me at all at a personal level.Aside from that more serious consideration...a few other observations:The good:Winston Duke: he filled the charismatic hole left by the loss of Bozeman. He was the only one who could bring any levity or humor to this film (even though many others tried) and he could bring the gravitas to bear when he needed to. I am very interested to see a story that puts him at center.Lupita Nyongo: she's wonderful, but way underutilized. We needed so much more of Nakia in this film.And...that's all I can think of. I'm sorry, but I really couldn't find much to like about this.The Bad:the length: this movie was interminably long and you really felt it. This, perhaps above all, is why I have a hard time understanding why people like this movie. The scenes and sequences that filled that run time were so boring to me. It was one of those movies in which I just wanted to leave and do something else.action: the action scenes are really poorly done: badly composed vfx with little noticeable stunt work and practical effects, very short takes and quick cuts that often left me confused as to who exactly was fighting and who wasn't. I remember one sequence where I thought M'Baku was fighting in the melee on the carrier and got knocked off, only to find him fighting in a different area onboard on the very next sequence.the script: so poorly written, with little coherence. Very rarely did scenes work to move the story forward and the motivations of the characters made little sense.for example: why did Namor have to find and kill the scientist? Why her specifically? Why not the leader of the mining operation? Why not the officer in charge of the military operation? Why not the president of the US? Why did it unquestionably have to be the 19 year old college girl that moonlights as a US contractor? And why is he so stubbornly committed to it? It seems like nothing could put him off of such a silly goal. Also, why is she called ""the scientist""? Isn't she more of an engineer? It's a little thing, but it really grated on me.Why were Shuri and Queen Ramonda so committed to protecting Riri at all costs? There's no clear reason why they should have been so committed to protecting her as opposed to any number of other innocents who lost their lives in these battles. I'm not saying that they shouldn't have protected her...only that there were lots of threats and lots of people's lives at stake and their only concern was to save the life of this college student they didn't know.Or what about the plan to kill Namor? They're going to get him on a ship that has the ability to dry out his skin and that will somehow take his power from him. Something, incidentally, not set up in any way by any action of the plot, but only ad hoc mentioned in a fifteen second bit of exposition that gives them the solution they need. But after getting him on said ship, he just takes his spear and plunges it through the motor. How did they not make a provision for this? How could they're planning have been so short sighted?Also, why at the end of the movie, does Namor tell his friend that the most powerful warriors on the surface have just become their allies, when his people had just utterly dominated them? What about Wakanda impressed him and made him think they had military value for him and his people?Also, I love Martin Freeman and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, but there was absolutely nothing that they added to this film...and every scene they were in was a nuisance.And what was that at the end? Why did M'Baku come out and challenge for the throne and then ""end scene""? What were they trying to tell us? Did this mean that Shuri has abdicated the throne? Does it mean that M'Baku is challenging her and their alliance is broken? Did she ask him to do it? Did she run off because she didn't want to be Queen? They just didn't tell us anything at all, and that seems, again, a really odd choice to make."
8," A Great Follow Up for an Impossible Task
",jeanpierrexxiii,/user/ur154297627/,12 November 2022,"Look. Chadwick is gone and that void cannot be filled. Also, the wonder of first visiting Wakanda is gone. I felt the first movie was an 8.5/10 but its impact was way beyond what I could nitpick critically. That movie reverberated for me as a member of the Black diaspora in a way that I doubt those outside of it could understand, even if they appreciated it. It dealt with things we're dealing with on a daily basis and connected us with our past/history using a fictional nation.Wakanda Forever doesn't have this, even if it's great to revisit Wakanda. It does have a bonafide newcomer in Namor (Tenoch Huerta) and Talokan. I LOVED seeing their nation and can only imagine what it meant for Latinx/indigenous representation, even if it wasn't quite immersive and setup as Wakanda. Will we get a Namor solo movie? Curious about what that story what would like but I digress. It is a very welcome and central part of this sequel.RiRi Williams/Ironheart is another good addition, though it feels a bit 'off' for some reason. Don't want to give any spoilers but her inclusion in the plot doesn't quite make sense, though I enjoyed her. Shuri (Letitia Wright) can't quite handle the weight of what she's given which I feel is partly intentional and partly her shortcomings as an actor. Other than that, everyone gives great performances.The CGI leaves much to be desired in a few instances but not bad overall. This movie doesn't need to rely on spectacle that much and at times, I feel that is lost on them a bit. But that's the machine right?? I mean, this IS a Marvel movie still. The costume design and music can probably repeat as Oscar winners depending on the competition.There are many poignant emotional moments in the movie as it deals with grief/loss and the question of where do we go from here? There are no easy answers and I don't think Ryan Coogler tries to answer them. He does his best to deal with the loss of Chadwick and deliver something worthy of a tribute and a sequel to one of the MCU's best movies.Yes, it could've been shorter by about 15-20 minutes. Yes, the plot is a bit meandering/convoluted/unresolved. No doubt, it is a flawed film but still a must-see for fans of the first and those grieving Chadwick. Like grief, it doesn't unfold perfectly but we need to get through it and move on. It will be interesting to see where the next Black Panther goes but I'm sure it will be quite some time before we revisit Wakanda.Not a disappointment but not quite up to the hype the initial trailer gave me. Like pallbearers, the cast support the weight of the huge loss of Chadwick Boseman to the best of their ability with mostly satisfactory results. 8/10."
8," An emotional, visually stunning movie
",balazsap,/user/ur118960283/,12 November 2022,"This was one of the best movies in MCU's phase 4. I think it has paid tribute to Chadwick Boseman in an correct way.The start of the movie was a little slow-paced but it presented the political problems that have been caused by Wakanda not sharing vibranium.The whole movie is like an emotional rollercoaster. There are action scenes but they don't take a big part of the movie. There were some really good 1v1 fights, but a battle was a little boring.The ending is very emotional and closes Wakanda's story well, but there could have been a more detailed ending.In short, I think it was a great, emotional movie, and I will definitely watch it again, but the ending might be strange for somebody."
9," Epic finale to a controversial phase 4
",huntergriff,/user/ur158762513/,12 November 2022,"Wakanda Forever definitely gave what my expectations hoped for. Wright delivered as Shuri, and her character development was brilliant. Namor will become a lot of people's fan favorites as he was a terrifying, intimidating, and a backstory that will leave you wanting more of him. Visuals and core fight scenes were satisfying to watch. Music is definitely great, too. Iron Heart's introduction definitely has me hopeful for her spin-off series next phase. And lastly, movie did everything right by honoring Chadwick. This was definitely an emotional roller coaster. Overall, this was an epic and emotional finale to an controversial phase 4, and it didn't disappoint."
10," IT WAS AMAZING!PERIOD!
",kajratovnaamina,/user/ur158763346/,12 November 2022,"This movie blew up literally everything. I liked everything! It's not just a fight for something, but it also makes a lot of sense. The film was the most epic of the 4 phases, which made me feel a wide range of emotions. I EVEN CRIED FROM HOW BEAUTIFUL IT WAS. I highly recommend it.Special thanks for the chic soundtracks, they helped to feel all the moments with all my heart and touched to the core.I can't quite understand the bad reviews while the movie has become a period. A minute of silence dedicated to a ONLY ONE REAL black panther broke everyone in the hall. And the scene after the credits ... I don't even have words to describe what an explosion it was, literally the whole full hall began to yell and clap, I'm still in ecstasy after watching.WAKANDA FOREVERðŸ–¤"
4," Eh...and go back to the source material.
",richardsonthered,/user/ur34297944/,12 November 2022,"Namor was just bad. And i dont get the need to make all men ""beta's"" or evil. Why can't men and women all be equally strong? And why the terrible death off screen for T'Challa? So stupid...hey lets give him the respect but kill him off offscreen? Same thing happened with so many good heroes that the agenda no longer fits with...Han Solo? Really the same...and namor is not from South America....his back story is rich in history...going back to the Egyptian and roman legends of the ancient mariner. And really colonialism?...if the aztecs and incans weren't colonialised they would still be sacrificing innocent people and ripping their hearts out. This idea that all white colonialism is the source of all evil in history.....men have been dominating each other for centuries...the virtue signalling in this terrible film was just bad. And before you call me racist just know...my problems with Namor weren't with the actor...I'm sure he's a great actor...Namor could be played by anyone...but the stupid backstory just made this bad for me...Namor has been one of my favourite anti-hero/heroes in marvel since childhood...his story was treated with disrespect...and lets not forget ironheart...Riri Williams was annoying. Oh and she's the whole reason for the story? She was dumb. And i just dont agree with the whole ""all women strong...no weaknesses...' with little to no explanation....why was she so smart again?...this is our replacement for Tony stark? Wow...marvel is done...bye bye good story...hey Disney! Do you not like money anymore? Well I'm not alone in being done with marvel and disney."
8," Perfect tribute to Chadwick
",Jonathanb-97,/user/ur158122129/,12 November 2022,The way they honoured Chadwick Boseman Black Panthers death in the movie was really good just wish they explained it more. The story and setting of the movie was great and great too explore some old parts of the first black panther movie and some new parts and also too see a new side of the world/MCU. I would have like too see some bigger parts of the MCU integrated in the movie but we really did not see that and wish they would have used some characters more like Nakia and more of Namor story. Overall solid movie just not better then the first one though 8/10. And one more thing there is only one post credit scene so you dont have to stay till end credits. Great scene and worth watching in theatre and in IMAX if possible.
10," Amazing movie, perfectly balanced.
",alnasir-24807,/user/ur94048090/,12 November 2022,"Beautiful visuals, story, acting, colors, music, cast. It's probably one of the best MCU films to date.Not having Chadwick was a huge challenge and the fimakers delt with this in the most graceful way possible. Doing justice to the actor, the character and the audience.The soundtrack itself is a journey, such a great representation of the rich cultures the story takes inspiration from.Fight sequences - as an action movie lover - there can always be more fight sequences, more one on one battles more boom ! More bang ! While the action is not the primary focus, the sequences are beautifully choregraphed."
6," Namor was great - should have been his movie
",RussHog,/user/ur41031967/,12 November 2022,"Wakanda Forever tells the story of how Wakanda got a new Black Panther in a war with the Atlantis (or whoever they were). The film's best parts are the underwater beings who attack Wakanda. Prince Namor is really cool and the actor who plays him has great screen presence. His underwater people are a lot of fun to see in action.The film's big problem is that the lead is insufferable and annoying. She doesn't have a lot of screen charisma, makes a much better sidekick than a main protagonist, and overall it's not that interesting that she ever becomes Black Panther. You never really root for her I this film.Also, this film is mostly boring acting and writing repeating information we already know and everyone being depressed all the time. It's hard to get into a movie that is two hours and forty minutes of this.Probably, it should have just been called Namor and have Wakanda be the side characters."
9," Extremely well-made film!
",blackjack90631,/user/ur11407004/,12 November 2022,"The aquatic visuals were stunning and the music was so beautifully rhythmic, at times hypnotic :) The parallels between African colonization and South American colonization were nice to see. The movie excels in taking its time to develop Shuri as T'challa's eventual replacement and I felt the character growth paid off in the end. I believed her as the new Black Panther. I can't say the same for the new MIT college student they added. A lot of her scenes seemed unearned which reminded me of my main gripe with recent Marvel films. I want backstory, growth, development etc. And lately there have beeb many characters who are BOOM Day 1 already amazing. Granted, Shuri does perform some insane unearned acrobatics, but at least they took the time to give us a good arch for her. And again, mad kudos to the audio and visual teams here. Overall, I would happily rewatch this film for the art alone."
5," Dull, long, more about visuals vs story line. Sequel bomb!
",FireStation46,/user/ur119994823/,12 November 2022,"It hurts when a sequel bombs. This movie is a MOAB dud. Story line is looking for a path to clarity and remains lost in a fog. They could cut out Â½ the movie and maybe it would be more engaging.They should have taken the high ground and just retired the original. This story line is not compelling, dialogue is not clear. Too much reliance on visual
Computer generated visuals.I was very happy when this movie ended. I an a lot of others must have shared my feelings as there was a surge of people getting out and not staying for the credits.This bomb will likely be sold online or in big box stores in time for the holidays.I suppose if you need beer coaster, the DVD set of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever will be of some use."
8," Wakanda Forever Review
",bradykitchen-33648,/user/ur125900670/,12 November 2022,"Following the death of King T'Challa, Wakanda finds themselves face to face with a unknown nation that threatens their home.Ryan Coogler, was probably dealt the absolute worst hand as a filmmaker. Having written the entire script, then having to mourn the untimely death of your lead character is probably the most painful experience as a director. That being said he did an excellent job with the film and paying his respects to Chadwick Boseman.The first thing that I'd like to touch on is the story itself specifically how they dealt with Bosemans tragic passing. Cooglers method of handling it made sense throughout and created a lot of great emotion. The emotion throughout the film was top notch and it wasn't just the emotion involving T'Challa, there were plenty of elements that allowed the cast to showcase their talent and give quality performances.The acting across the board is fantastic. Letitia Weight did an incredible job stepping up to the leading role and I can't praise her enough. Angela Basset was phenomenal in this film and gave her all in every scene. Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong's were both excellent in their respective roles.The rest of plot for the most part hit it's mark, but there was a subplot involving Martin Freeman's character that I felt didn't need to be there at all. Removing that element probably would've cut a good chunk of that 2 hours and 40 minute run time.Now the thing that I was most concerned about going into this film was Namor. The MCU has a history of poorly handling their villains so I had my doubts going in. In my opinion Namor is one of the best MCU villains to date. They actually gave him proper development and a motivation that makes sense.Although Namor was great his nation as an entirety was not as threatening. I didn't get the feeling that they were this all powerful nation that they kept describing them as. To me Namor was the threat and there were very few times where I felt that his nation had the upper hand to Wakanda.The final thing I'll touch on is Ironheart, on a surface level I like her character, obviously this isn't her film so she doesn't get that much development but at face value her character is cool. That being said if they were to take another look at the script I think they would've been able to write her out or reduce her involvement fairly easily. She has a crucial role at the beginning of the film but after that she is very much a tag along character and was only used as a comic relief. She does get some extra attention towards the end but nothing that really justified her involvement throughout. This isn't a big issue considering I did like her character, just something to note.Overall this is a great film. The emotional impact of Bosemans death and the development of our core characters is handled with grace, and the addition of Namor is extremely well done.8.5/10
A-"
6," It's fine, I guess?
",plowrie85,/user/ur51306755/,12 November 2022,"First off, it's long. There's minimal action. The action there is is disappointing. So we have a fairly boring movie. I get the intention to focus on the emotional notes in the wake of CB's death, but it just didn't hit me in my feels. My husband cried. A lot. I remain unmoved. The visuals appear very muted when compared to first movie. Bizarre inclusion of naming conventions/explanations Ã  la Solo movie. We get even more characters getting nano suits. Really? I know it's hard to come up with new ideas, but we've seen more than enough of these at this point.As I said, it's fine. I guess. Definitely didn't hate it."
10," Great Follow-up to a great first entry!
",darynmprice,/user/ur158759847/,12 November 2022,"Firstly, let me address the elephant in the room. For those saying that this is not as good as the first movie, understand that this movie isn't trying to be the first movie but rather an extension of a complex story due to real life tragedy.Obviously Chadwick Boseman's loss effected the franchise and it's future installments. Due to this fact, I appreciate how the movie tackles this head in. As many have said, it is a great homage to his legacy but as real-life teaches us, despite loss, life goes on. This is what I like most about the movie. It takes itself seriously and deals with the emotions behind loss and grief. For anyone that has ever lost a loved one, this movie may surely help navigate you through the grieving process.To be frank, I love the action scenes and overt CGI as much as the next person, but it was a breathe of fresh air to get something new from a studio that rehashes the same story over and over and over... and over again.Go into the movie with an open mind and see it as an extension as opposed to a continuation and I promise you will be please.Peace and blessings,Dee."
10," I liked
",manueldossantos-62150,/user/ur157940349/,12 November 2022,"Excellent Movie and most beautiful Tribute to Chadwick in the beginning & end of the film!!The treatment of Boseman's death is sensitive and tasteful and the movie introduces an interesting idea about the shared pain between Namor and Shuri.The dialogues were well framed, the jokes were great no more and no less.CGI even loved it, because Marvel knew how to explore the Submarine beauty and the other landscapes, the soundtrack, simply epic.The framing of some characters was also acceptable, had screen time for everyone although some fights left to be desired why in a fight involving feelings of revenge."
8," Truly an Ode to Chadwick Boseman
",courtney_london,/user/ur49072633/,12 November 2022,"Wakanda Forever truly is an ode to Chadwick Boseman. Not surprising for most, the film includes many references to King T'Challa's death and the impact it has on the Royal family, Wakanda and globally.There is a great amount of depth within the characters because so much of the film is surrounding the death of the Black Panther; this bodes well for the character development of many of the more secondary characters from the original film.The introduction of the underwater world, Talocan, was done extremely well. Not only was Talocan visually stunning, the story behind the city wasn't rushed and tied into Mesoamerica and Aztec culture similarly the introduction of Wakana in the original film. The costume and production design succeeded in what other underwater worlds were unable to do (cough Aquaman)! Shout out to Ruth E. Carter and Hannah Beachler for their outstanding work!The stand out in this movie for me is Tenoch Huerta whom plays Namor, the ruler of the underwater kingdom. In my opinion, Namor's story would have been a great stand alone film for MCU.Not quite at the same level as the original Black Panther, but Wakanda Forever delivers for fans in a major way."
10," Watch it!!!!
",melrosercgm,/user/ur147770959/,12 November 2022,"I don't get the mixed reviews. I'm not sure if we saw the same movie? Because what I saw is a great movie that is character driven, world building (the introduction of Talokan) and the backbone of it all the coping after the loss of someone.There's reviews saying Chad was being praised too much and has been the center of it all. Chad did passed away and as his character King T'Challa (black panther) also passes away with an unknown illness. Wakanda is left grieving their King and been left without a protector. That's the plotline so i dont get why other people thinks its a weak plot when its done masterfully and with great respect not only to Chadwick but with everyone involved.Letitia Wright. What an actress. Did you notice that she embodied Chadwick??? All his mannerism and gestures she incorporated it in her character. When you watched the previous films she acts differently like a baby sister who adores his brother but Shuri is weighed down by responsibility as next in line and filling the void his brother has left. Her being the next black panther for me it was a smart move. You could definitely see in her that she did her homework and brought back pieces of Chadwick in her black panther and it was amazing.Angela Basset was truly a regal Queen âœ¨The soundtrack was phenomenal it was soooo good!!!So all those who disliked this movie you all got covid and lost your sense of taste ðŸ™ƒ"
1," This movie sucked it is the women king for Black Panther Shuri emotional journey
",sboykins-72199,/user/ur156506597/,12 November 2022,"This movie sucked nobody care about Shuri emotional journey and the fact that this was an almost all female cast with all the men sidelines. This movie force you to turn off your brain with it high level of disbelief and WTF moment. There are so many things in this move that made no sense but by far the worst thing was Ironheart (Riri Williams) the ghetto super genius her dialog and attitude were so cringy. And then there Namor this is not the comic book Namor. Visually, the two share ankle wings, pointy ears, gold bracelets, and that's pretty much it not a fan of this so some will love it or hate it."
8," Solid enough to succeed
",cardsrock,/user/ur24373984/,12 November 2022,"Ryan Coogler was put in a difficult position with the passing of Chadwick Boseman, but he manages to craft a compelling, if overstuffed, sequel to the cultural phenomenon.Boseman's death is handled gracefully and the film is often quite emotional with its mourning. The film excels exploring these themes, but falters a bit with the Ironheart and CIA stuff. Much of this could have been cut to trim down on the massive runtime. Namor's story is another triumph as well. He's a sympathetic villain that will hopefully have big things to do in the future. I am a bit underwhelmed with the person chosen as the new BP, but it makes sense within the story they're telling.Regardless of any story faults, there is an element of artfulness and maturity that Coogler brings which most MCU films lack. The visuals are unmatched in the MCU and the underwater city in particular is a marvel to behold. Ludwig has crafted another Oscar worthy score and the music is great as well. There are several surprises sprinkled throughout. The action is fine, if not terribly impressive. It seems like they just made a less arresting version of the car chase from the first film.Wakanda Forever is largely successful in what it sets out to do, that being grieving over Boseman's death and setting up the future of the franchise."
2," Very disappointing
",ngozinwafor,/user/ur158758836/,12 November 2022,"This movie was a movie I was very much looking forward to watching. This was my movie of the year. I was disappointed in literally EVERY way possible. The story was not fleshed out and felt rushed. We don't know anything about Namor...his back story was RUSHED through. His kingdom was quite boring to look at. A lot of the soundtrack used in scenes were ridiculous.The action sequences were VERY minimal, boring and mediocre. Zuri automatically knowing how to fight was really stupid... When did she suddenly have training? Nakia was in the movie like for a total of seven minutes. Mbaku for like five. It didn't feel like an adventure. I wasn't thrilled. Iron hearts role was useless. Even Namors henchmen had no personality...The only thing I liked about the movie was the first 20 minutes. And I also liked the surprise at the end of the credits."
7," Thus Ends Phase Four
",dorMancyx,/user/ur125833174/,12 November 2022,"So much has been expected from Wakanda Forever, as the firstpeek into the notorious Namor alongside his Empire Atlantis (or Taloca according to modification), as the conclusion to Marvel's phase four, and as a final farewell to our forever Black Panther - Chadwick Boseman. How can any superhero movie possibly achieve all these while narrating a unique, emotive, and memorable story?In the first five minutes of the film, the Black Panther we used to know is dead, with neither a sceneshown nor a reason explained: so fast, so sudden, so unfair, and yet so powerful just like how the tragicnews struck us in reality. Though T'Challla's gone, his legacy remains in the impact of Wakanda's foreign diplomacy, which directly causes the surfacing of a second vibranium-wielding kingdom. Moreover, the trauma of king's decease pervades throughout the movie asan unspoken while defining threadthat sews all fundamental motives,further influencing the plot progression, character development, and overall theme, that is, ""how and why we should keep moving onward"".Through the near explosive performance of Angela Bassett, we see the majesty of a regal monarch, the apprehension of a childless guardian, and the anguish of a lost mother from every of Ramonda's glare, bellow, and forbearance. Nothing afflicts more ache than hearing the queenhowling about Shuri's abduction and exposing her vulnerability as ahelpless parent. However, Ramonda's unduly defensive approach to the safety of her own nation and daughter is, substantively, negligence over the problems effected by Wakanda, costing her life in hands of those equally tormented by T'Challa. Shuri, logically the most qualified successor of the throne, is mentally the least eligible inheritorof Black Panther. As seen in previous movies, Shuri is but a kid,who knows not the grief of bereavement, the duty as a protector, or the answer to vengeance - for a long while, Shuriis almost possessed by Killmonger's retaliatory identity. Despite the quick revival of conscience, the princess is, at the utmost, aware of her royal responsibilities and upholds benevolence at heart. Shuri may not be the most right Black Panther, but she is a Black Panther.Personally, I'm not too invested in Riri Williams, especially due to Ironheart's so-called title as the second Iron Man - Marvel alreadyhas a young, talented, red-suited hero whose name is not to be recalled and is also very much the replacement for Tony. Additionally,with all due respect, Ironheart's armor looks like the talking toy robot I got for Christmas 11 years ago. Bearing much suspense, Namor, one of the most iconic Marvel comic characters, makes his much-anticipated entrance in the film. Without a doubt, the depiction of Taloca is ravishing: exotic environmental designs, opaque underwater sceneries, andaesthetically fascinating costumesall mark the unparalleled charismaof this novel civilization. Though the unquestionable antagonist of the story, all of Namor's decisions and actions are perfectly reasoned, as if to challenge the scale of justice and ethics. In my opinion, if the Kukulkan can be portrayed with a bit more guile and hypocrisy, the character would have more depth and dynamic just like in the comics.Another thing to be complimentedis the score composed by the amazing Ludwig GÃ¶ransson, utilizing a repetition of yelps to demonstrate the stealth of intruders and the sidling of conflict. One mesmerizing employment of music is the Talocan sonic weapon, which comprises the soft yet piercing humming that blends in unnoticeably with the background,as when the audience recognizes its effect, the attack has already sent the passengers offboard. However, I'd still like to have the original Black Panther theme - the full-of-African-vibe drum beats - used in later Black Panther movies.Thus ends phase four of Marvel: arguably a not-so-satisfying period mostly eliciting the inheritance of Avengers. There is perceptible foreshadowing of future content sprinkled throughout this journey, including De Fonte's maneuvering behind several major incidents, and Werewolf by Night'a presentation of a mystical realm. Overall, hopefully phase five could connect some if not all of the countless storylines and pave a thrilling road to Avengers 5 and 6."
9," Great tribute! I super enjoyed it
",stanislas-54865,/user/ur158670191/,12 November 2022,"Seen 'Wakanda Forever' twice already! Yes i find it so so good.. the movie builds up well offering a great emotional action story buildup with lots of interesting twists.The background music is awesome, synchronizing super well with the action sequences and very nice impactful character appearances.This Black Panther' movie with the introduction of these characters sure offers lots of great potential ahead to develop the future marvel stories.The dialogues and subtle comedy were also very cool. Great job done by the actors.. In this way the movie displayed well the challenges and evolutions of the main characters personalities.The main villain's style is very intriguingly nice and
I would really like to see more of him in the future Marvel movies.I found this movie super enjoyable and a great tribute to Chadwick Bozeman, with a 9/10 score."
6," Good for the most part
",jprice-38253,/user/ur131232088/,12 November 2022,"No doubt the movie pays excellent and emotional tribute to Chadwick Boseman. Ryan Coogler brings us back to Wakanda with its characters, elaborate set design, eye popping costume designs, African culture, African hymns and much more. This time, our characters face an unknown foe that are apparently a water-like Mayan tribe and a threat to Wakanda. The movie also takes place in several different locations as well.I really wish I could say this sequel was absolutely amazing. But unfortunately for me, the first hour and 30 minutes or so was boring, confusing and seemed to drag. I wasn't feeling anything for the characters, it didn't seem to know what direction it was going and all I was watching was a bunch of action, (which was cool by the way). I thought it took too long until it finally got somewhere. The main villain was ok I guess. Basically an Aquaman knock-off. The last hour or so was really good though!While the this sequel is obviously not as good as the first one, it doesn't deserve to be bashed down below a 5 at all. At that point, people are just being disrespectful about it, saying because Chadwick Boseman wasn't it or because ""it focused too much on him and his death."" or because people are just looking for the attention. Then it's like what in the world did you expect to be seeing??Wakanda Forever is still worth the watch. It shows the clear message of still staying strong over the loss of leaders...."
8," Best since the last spider man.
",jamesmcconnon,/user/ur22615961/,12 November 2022,"Possibly even the best since End Game. Really felt that Marvel had been going off the boil lately. Dr Strange was a mess, Thor Love and Thunder was underwhelming and the Eternals erased all the goths from Camden.But this one was very good, really packed am emotional punch, especially Letitia Wright as Shurri, grieving for her brother. That woman really deserves to become a big star. She had some serious acting chops.It's not perfect, it's a bit overlong, Riri feels shoehorned in, and Namor's second in command could do with a bit more fleshing out, especially since what little we saw of her was interesting. But overall, really enjoyed it."
9," Did well for its purpose: honoring chadwick boseman
",bryantchastainoutlookcom,/user/ur157340038/,12 November 2022,"Let me just say that this film was great. It had action, emotion, and strong character growth. However, my only complaint is it's a little bit too long. With a run time of 2 hours and 41 minutes it is probably better to wait until it hits Disney plus sometime in January or February. I saw this opening night and I enjoyed it. However, I also had the feeling ""when is this thing going to be over?"" There were many unnecessary scenes and with the extended runtime I expected tMarvel to do more with certain characters. In the first Black Panther, Agent Ross (Martin Freeman) had a purpose in the film. In the new one, he is simply there to give information and is given a few unnecessary scenes.As for the villian, Namor is a pretty standard villain. As usual, the plot gives time for an origin story and at least some development. However, when you are watching the movie for the first 2 hours you are just wondering when black panther is going to show up. The writers decide to wait about the whole movie to put someone into the suit. (I'm trying to make this spoiler free so I won't say who).This movie is not top 10 Marvel. It struggles with plot consistency and a blander villain than the first. Marvel did keep their promise about this film having heart and good action. They honored Chadwick Boseman and did their job. This movie tugs at your heartstrings. It is the best fully Marvel produced movie since endgame. (I'm saying fully produced because NWH was Sony produced as well)"
7," A Memorial Service for Chadwick Boseman
",bsus1412,/user/ur28834643/,12 November 2022,"This film functioned more as a memorial service for moving on from the death of Chadwick Boseman, so while the world building was interesting and the costumes/character designs as spectacular as ever, much was lost in the focus of Shuri as T'Challa's successor. She was shoehorned into her role as the main character not because she deserved it through her own virtues but because the comics demanded it. On the other hand, the supporting cast was absolutely perfect!This plot would have been perfect for the Inhumans show, but not as an MCU film. Heck, there was no little recognition of any other part of the MCU besides one small guest appearance. Without even a post-credits scene and a mid-credit scene that could have just as easily been slipped into the main movie, the entirety of the film felt like a waste of potential.If you enjoyed the Black Panther, you will enjoy this film. BUT, this a movie made to be seen only once and be put aside, rather than as something to be purchased for rewatching."
9," A triumph considering the circumstances
",terrence-46906,/user/ur85545740/,12 November 2022,"I like this movie a lot, but you do feel Chadwick's absence in it. I was one to say recast T'challa, but the MCU train has to keep moving, and it would have felt too soon after Chadwick's death to recast. Everyone was great in this movie, it has great acting, especially from Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett. The story was great, although I felt like Ross and Julia Louis Dreyfus was forced in to the script, it was like Marvel saying ""Hey, remember this is an MCU movie"" and they didn't do that in the first movie. I think Namor's speech getting his people ready for war, was a over-the-top cliche. It would have been better delivered, holding the dead of one of his people and telling one of his main warriors to prepare them for war. The final battle felt a little weak once Shuri took Namor away, and the fight between Namor and Shuri was okay. The cinematography was pretty good, but not as good as the first one. Besides these things, the movie was great, and well especially under the circumstances."
2," so so
",bjornwilck,/user/ur29013338/,12 November 2022,Nothing new to the genre of Marvel movies. I am actually starting the get fed up on them by now. But sure it had its highs and made me smile more the once. As pure entertaining for 2 hours it worked. But it didnt give me any longings for the next one and I think it will end like the first one in 6months I will have forgotten that I saw the movie. Still not sure if I have the seen the first one even if my friends told me I had done it.The cgi was good for the most time and it gave us some fighting scenes that was new for atleast me. I think it havent been done in that way earlier. Running downwards on a boat fighting bad guys +1 on that!
9," The depth of this movie and what it tackles in terms of grief, pride, strength and collaboration is tremendous.
",kevin_robbins,/user/ur131783850/,12 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) is a movie we saw as a family in theaters last night. The storyline follows the tragic death of Black Panther, the king of Wakanda, and the grief that is left on his people and the strength of his family to continue to lead with pride. Meanwhile, the world wants the source of Wakanda's power, vibranium. It becomes apparent another source of vibranium is available under water and the world rushes to obtain it, but the Earth doesn't know a civilization is under the Earth to protect it...a civilization stronger than Wakanda and its people. That civilization blames Wakanda for the Earth knowing about vibranium and demands Wakanda help take the world over or fall under its foot with everyone else.This movie is directed by Ryan Coogler (Creed) and stars Letitia Wright (Letitia Wright), Lupita Nyong'o (Us), Danai Gurira (The Walking Dead), Angela Bassett (Strange Days), Winston Duke (Modern Family), Tenoch Huerta (The Forever Purge) and Martin Freeman (The Hobbit).The depth of this movie and what it tackles in terms of grief, pride, strength and collaboration is tremendous. The depiction of the Wakanda people and how they deal with grief and their pride is perfectly depicted. The villain is absolutely out of this world as is how his backstory is told. Their methods and approaches both to life and violence were entertaining. The cast delivers tremendous performances top to bottom, especially Angela Bassett and Tenoch Huerta. The CGI and special effects were again out of this world as were the action scenes. The ultimate outcome of every character, sub plot and storyline was perfect, as was the after credit scenes.Overall, the storyline and direction of this movie is very unique for the super hero genre and an absolutely must see. I would score this movie an 8.5-9/10 and strongly recommend it."
10," A powerful and unique, but not your everyday superstar movie
",juie-31692,/user/ur73134955/,12 November 2022,"Spoiler alert] Watched Wakanda Forever on the day of the release and it was all worth it.This is not your everyday superhero vs villain movie. The message it gives is: ""there is not point in a long war, and it is worth forgiving your enemies and building alliances"". Something in the current era, our humanity can learn for.The movie starts with how the world powers want to control vibranium and continues on the story line introducing two nations and their ideologies towards protecting vibranium. I saw it very similar to nuclear arms race and how the current nations with 1000s of nuclear weapons don't want the rest of the world have it.Namour's character just like Black Panther's comes from background of oppression and personal loss. What they both do to come to terms with this loss sets their path. This is where the dialogues between Shuri and N'Jadaka play an important role. And this follows with philosophical dialogues with M'Baku, and Queen Ramona.Details like use of fire in the ancestral, the colour of Shuri's black panther suit, an Namor's wings, add those aesthetic touches to the beautiful storyline."

",kobeochieng-64247,/user/ur113807515/,12 November 2022,"When the death of Chadwick Boseman was announced I was worried if a black panther sequel would work without him. My worries were put to rest when I finally watched this movie. The heart wrenching plot, action sequences, and world building all worked together perfectly. The addition of namor was the best decision the mcu has made in a long time. I'm glad to see where all the characters go after this. Sometimes some of the story lines feel forced or like it was strictly put there just for the mcu but it doesn't effect the overall story. The cgi looked like some of the best of phase 4. And the credit scene wow."

I love every single music because they help a lot in most of the scene, mostly how they take us to the new world and yet i never even heard of this place or culture m, that's how much the music help! And the action is maybe need more realistic? I don't have a better explanation for it, but i love it overall it was worth my 3 hour of sitting in the cinema, could it be better? Yea but is it bad?

",fidawork,/user/ur147295491/,12 November 2022,"I have to say i really enjoyed this movie. Not that it is an excuse, in my opinion it could be way way worse. How they continued the story without Chadwick, How they added cool new characters (DC (aquaman) take notes ;)), Set and story design was great. Sure, some things could have been different. For example the story around the ""proffesor"" feels random without depth. But overall i enjoyed it. For a movie this long it was not queite boring as well. The story was building up untill the second half of the movie, where i just was a bit curious of how they would connect the dots. Again, it was an enjoyable movie. Liked it more than the last marvel project with Thor. Rest in peace Chadwick."
9," A Fitting Tribute
",brentsbulletinboard,/user/ur156441404/,12 November 2022,"At the risk of overstatement, it's hard not to be blown away by writer-director Ryan Coogler's ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever."" This is a vast improvement over its predecessor offering (2018), if not the best picture to ever come out of the Marvel Universe. It's the kind of film that shows comic book movies can indeed go beyond action sequences and endless explosions to offer viewers something more meaningful and substantial, a result capable of silencing critics like filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who blanketly contend that these releases are without artistic merit. What's more, this second outing in the franchise has undoubtedly saved it from oblivion after losing its lead character in the wake of its initial outing with the untimely death of protagonist Chadwick Boseman. In addition to telling a compelling story, this film provides a credible bridge to the future while fittingly serving as a respectful tribute to its fallen star, one that honors the actor in a way that the movie industry unfortunately never did. Its tactful, reverential treatment of this issue is sure to evoke an emotional response, if not a few tears, in a truly loving but not maudlin way. Beyond that, the narrative and character development in this installment are also a significant cut above the original, telling a more engaging story with deftly nuanced themes that make its predecessor look comparatively simple. It also features fine performances by its ensemble cast, particularly Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and, most notably, Angela Bassett in a genuinely Oscar-worthy portrayal. But what's most impressive is the film's handling of its principal themes, delving into concepts that action-adventure offerings rarely, if ever, do, and certainly not as capably addressed as here (making pictures like ""The Woman King"" appear somewhat amateurish by comparison). To be sure, there are a few elements that might have been handled better (the picture is a little too long, it underutilizes the talents of Winston Duke, and there are a few too many James Cameron-esque graphic and cinematic attributes reminiscent of ""Avatar"" (2009) and ""The Abyss"" (1989)), but these are minor shortcomings in comparison to everything else the picture has to offer. Of course, it's impossible to talk about this release without noting that it probably wouldn't have the same onscreen impact were it not for the tragic offscreen story that has sadly accompanied it, though the filmmakers truly deserve praise for their sensitive handling of this matter without giving in to cheap exploitation or sensationalism, results that may very well have occurred in lesser-skilled hands. It's truly comforting to see that the ""Black Panther"" franchise has managed to weather this storm and to do so as well as it has. Wakanda Forever indeed."
7," Amazing, Perfect tribute to T'Challa.
",Ketch_Rajath-10656,/user/ur120857981/,12 November 2022,"Wakanda Forever is a perfect tribute to late actor Chadwick Boseman and also perfect sequel to Black Panther. Ryan Coogler did an amazing job despite the absence of the lead character T'Challa from the previous film. He also did great in showcasing Wakandan culture.There are some really great visuals but some places it was a let down.The movie has its drawbacks but all can be overseen with its engaging screenplay and amazing actions. Many new characters were properly introduced in a way by keeping its proper back story.The background score is one of the highlights of this movie, Ludwig G繹ransson gave an amazing score. All the cast were simply outstanding."

",vireyes001,/user/ur57122805/,12 November 2022,"This is gotta be by far the worst marvel movie.Mcu has been lowering quality with every new project but this one took it to a whole other level.They tried to make an emotive mature drama but never succeeded, movie lacks a linear development of events, lots scenes makes no sense whatsoever and dialogues looks written by 47 people that never gather together to discuss what they were doing.Cgi is she-hulk quality in some scenes, specially in the suits of the heroes, that's embarrassing.Namor's acting is painful to watch.If you wanna feature an emotion on screen there's no reason to yell it out, if the script is good enough.And the last thing. I will never understand how the BLACK PANTHER movie shows maybe 3 minutes of the actual character on screen, honestly WTF."
2," Really failed my expectations
",koaychayan,/user/ur154958056/,12 November 2022,"Alright, this will be controversial but yeah, I've officially given up on Marvel, no really! You can disagree with me as much as you want, call it irrelevant or whatever. I had high expectations for this but it disappointed me. This movie really sucks because more than halfway, it really boring and it didn't really scream ""black panther"" to me. The characters didn't make much sense and the plot was really lacking the thrills. For me, this movie felt like something was missing here. But I think there is one improvement which was the cgi effect. It had multiple acceptance which was a tribute to Chadwick Boseman, the new characters and the cinematography."
3," Forced feminism fest
",harryfoulger-12156,/user/ur102149516/,12 November 2022,"The film was okay at best. There was like 5 men in the whole film none of which were powerful because god forbid a man is half useful in the MCU anymore, aside from that corny villain, namor, who of course had to be the villain and surrender to the women....literally says ""I yield"" or something similar. Just all feels so forced when there are much more inventive story lines that could have been explored, I was personally rooting for shuri to go into the ancestral plane and find a way to pull T'challa out, which, due to Chadwicks unfortunate passing, she would fail to do and accidentally bring kill monger out instead who would have his hero arc... but anyway they didn't go for any of those story lines or any of the potentially good ones, instead shuri becomes the black panther without having to fight for it like all the predecessors because let's face it she would get beaten to a pulp.Bottom line is while shuri is a fantastic character, smarter than almost everyone and just great to watch. She should never have become the black panther. Doesn't suit her and she's simply not build for it. Metaphorically and physically. And all in all there was no men in this film that where even remotely strong compared to everyone else and it was just so forced, I'm all for a strong female character but not literally everyone in the movie and at the expense of the movies quality!"

The music was incredible and cinematography beautiful. I loved that they included the Mayan culture.This is definitely the best marvel movie in a long time for me, I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in awhile.

She done her maximum effort in the movie but not still good enough for chad.She just like a kid in the movie not strong physique to handle the Pather suit.Tenoch- Namor. The villan in movie but he is super strong at first getting weaken at last
The plot divied for both shuri and namor be stronger at first shuri is weaker after second half the movie she is stronger after drinking scarced liquid. Actually in thers she is not strong as villan in the movie.The mutual understanding between them in the last few minutes the movie end.Compare to the old panther movie this one is slow burning not good.I hope the next Black Pather movie had better then this oneT chala death and ending the same scene but i loved it's I think we miss the great actor in the movie feel sad for the loss while watching the movie.Action sequences are good and strong to hold the audiance crowd.Iron man like suit built on the movie is not good.

I was worried that Letitia Wright may not be able to carry the film by herself but ohhhh wow did she manage. Standout performance! The whole cast and crew came together to create a beautiful, emotional and exciting tribute to Chadwick! Tenoch Huerta does an incredible job at bringing Namor to the big screen, I cannot wait to see how his character develops and I'm glad to see that this doesn't look to be the last of his character in the MCU. Some really big moments set up throughout the film to bring things forward with another drop of the M word, the mid credits scene and a strong film to bring characters like Ironheart, Namor, Okoye, MBaku into the future of the MCU. Very happy with how this film worked out! Bring on phase 5!"

",eternitypm,/user/ur19808602/,12 November 2022,"What on earth has happened to Marvel these days, the list of dull and boring movies they are churning out is increasing yearly and is finally impacting whether or not I'll bother to go and see them anymore.I have to agree with alot of comments already written here, the pacing is slow, the fight scenes are severly lacking and unfortunately the movie is massively lacking its leader Mr Boseman, I'm sorry to say the rest of the cast can't fill the hole his sad passing has left.So with the poor Love & Thunder, the unexciting Eternals and the pointless Black Widow movie unfortunately filling Marvels current catalogue of dross what can they do to rectify the situation. Well, personally, I think they are stretching their Universe way to thin but then again what do I know as they wouldn't make this many movies if they weren't bringing in the money. So, unfortunately, the future for marvel and its fans looks to be more of the same .I'd love to be able to recommend this movie but I truly can't, your better off rewatching Black Panther and Chadwick Boseman in the original and celebrating when marvel movies were great!"

",Mugeez_5,/user/ur118382424/,12 November 2022,"An 8/10 rating for me, despite the slow-pacing and halting of momentum! Ryan Coogler and others did a very good job by Including the actual death of Chadwick Boseman former BLACK PANTHER in the sequel and re-writing the entire story.Disregarding the fact that you could sense the missing piece, for me that's a plus! Coming up with a newer version of the story in such a limited time. And it is at my strongest conviction that Nakia's son Prince T'Challa is going to be the next Panther, with this being said, I can almost say the writer did extremely well, by getting that last missing piece of the puzzle."

7," Wakanda Forever is a Ryan Coogler tribute movie to Chadwick Boseman rather than a Black Panther movie.
",bobtahar,/user/ur37083300/,12 November 2022,I've always been in recast T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) camp. After watching Wakanda Forever... well... I'm still with recast T'Challa camp.Shuri is great but she is no Black Panther in MCU... the movie eventhough good and entertaining... somehow felt empty... it needs a T'Challa figure. I'm pretty sure there are a lot of amazing Black actors that can step in the shoes of Chadwick Boseman.Namor is awesome... his character arc is very interesting and intriguing... I still don't know which side his in at the end.. he could be either the villain or the hero... I like to see more of him in MCU. Can't wait also for Iron Heart Disney+ show... great introduction to Riri Williams.Angela Bassett is a master class... this is her movie... she should get at least an Oscar nomination for this role.Overall... I feel Wakanda Forever is a Ryan Coogler tribute movie to Chadwick Boseman rather than a Black Panther movie. Still an entertaining movie... a way better movie than Thor Love and Thunder... but a tad too long though... it could shave out around 15 to 20 minutes.Recommended 7/0.... a lot of peoples claimed this is a very emotional movie... I think if you are a big fan of Chadwick Boseman... you'll get that feeling... I'm not a big fan so the emotions didn't hit me that hard.
3," Boring, don't watch.
",jackharpwr,/user/ur153362833/,12 November 2022,"It was boring the story was slow, the role of a leader simply didn't suit SHURI and this movie was only a BLACK PANTHER movie in the last 30-40 minutes, it should've been called, ""Queen Ramonda"". Namor was a nice yet wasted character his costume design was childish especially the jewellery he was wearing. There was no fight between the protagonist and the antagonist with both at their primes and at their full potential. Riri Williams (IRON HEART) is a disgrace to Tony Stark (IRON MAN). Even though it was such a long film they just ended it hastily. They should've simply recasted Michael B. Jordan as BLACK PANTHER or should've used Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa through deepfake technology. The only good things were some of the dialogues, the music's, and the water grenades. I don't have a problem with Black people. I have many Black friends but there are so many physically amazing and good looking Black people, MARVEL should've simply recasted T'Challa and kept a male leading character and the movie would've been way better. Or atleast Okoye should've been BLACK PANTHER since she has experience and battle IQ. I wasted 165 minutes of my life last night. The funniest part is that the director Ryan Coogler said that this film was gonna be like AVENGERS : ENDGAME, once in a lifetime movie ��不��不��不��不��不��不. He'd must've been wasted before the interview and the critics say that it was better than BLACK ADAM ��不��不��不��不��不��不. It actually is better than BLACK ADAM if you wanna be bored to death while watching a movie."

7," Despite the fallen king, Ryan Coogler manages to put down a worthy sequel.
",movieman6-413-929510,/user/ur34790048/,12 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is the sequel of the first Black Panther movie from 2018. This sequel is again directed and written in part by Ryan Coogler, who also directed the first part.In the film, the people of Wakanda honor their lost King T'Challa after his tragic death. This leaves Wakanda without their title of warrior Black Panther, making them appear weaker in the eyes of enemy forces. These try to make use of the vibranium, the precious raw material for which the country has become known.Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) and Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright) must now join forces with the Dora Milaje led by General Okoye (Danai Gurira) to protect their land. Wakanda is now under attack by a new unknown enemy, who come from the secret underwater world Talokan and are led by Namor (Tenoch Huerta).With this film, Ryan Coogler has made a worthy sequel, but has had a hard time with this. After the tragic death of actor Chadwick Boseman, who played T'Challa and the Black Panther in the first film, they have had to adapt the entire film and the ideas they had for it. Thus, the film conveys well what it can be like to lose a beloved colleague and friend. They also show how hard this can make life because of the enormous emptiness that can arise.With the first Black Panther film, Ryan Coogler successfully introduced a whole new world of fiction into the Marvel film world, reflecting different elements of African cultures. With this film he shows more how African cultures deal with something like the death of a beloved leader. In addition to this culture, in this sequel he now also introduces the underwater world of Talokan. This world reflects some of the Mexican Mayan culture. Unfortunately, this world doesn't come out as clearly as the world of Wakanda in the first film, but as a viewer you understand how most things work here. This world is somewhat reminiscent of the underwater world from the Aquaman film from 2018, but luckily it manages to create a world of its own.Talokan is located in the depths of the ocean and for a more realistic effect Ryan Coogler has also darkened this world much like the real deep environments of the ocean. The film is sometimes a bit too dark so you can't always follow exactly what is happening. The visual effects look good, but sometimes you can still see how they put things with CGI like explosions or the underwater world with a green screen in the film. Also, some characters come across more like they're from an anime or live-action kids TV show like Power Rangers.The acting is well portrayed in the film. Most of the actors who play characters from Wakanda convey well how hard the loss of their king and true friend Chadwick Boseman is. They provide realistic emotional moments. This is especially evident in Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett. Furthermore, Tenoch Huerta also knows how to introduce the character of Namor in the Marvel film world. It is special to see this character for the first time in a live-action film, because this was one of the first original heroes from the Marvel comic book world."
4," Conflicting Feelings
",fatfil-414-451797,/user/ur34818624/,12 November 2022,"First up, I have to confess, I wasn't the biggest fan of the first Black Panther Movie. Chadwick as a brilliant fit for the part, he was T'Challa, and made the movie for me. But I really don't think they did enough with the character.So that being said, his absence was obtusely noticeable in this movie, I had a hard time relating to, or even liking the remaining characters. Winston Duke as M'Baku, and Martin Freeman as Ross were the only two that I really cared about.Marvel movies have always been known for the humour they manage to include, and excel at that fine balance between drama and comedy, with the possible exception of Thor Love & Thunder, which at times felt like it was played purely for laughs. But's that a whole other review.Frankly this mostly bored me. There were only 3 or 4 action scenes, with a lot of, mostly depressing dialogue in between. The shadow of Chadwick Boseman hung heavy over this. There were constant references to him throughout, and don't get me wrong, there should absolute have been a tribute in the movie, but at times it threatened to take over the story.Having been raised on Marvel Comics in the '70s and '80s, I also struggled with portrayal of Namor. In the comics he was depicted with almost oriental features, skinny, but built, and regal. In the movie he had more Indian / South American appearance, and just lacked that air of nobility. But that is probably nit picking from a comic book fan. Putting that aside, if you were not aware of Namor before seeing this, Tenoch Huerta made a good job as the villain.My daughter said, as we were walking out the cinema, ""That just didn't feel like a Marvel movie."" And I think that pretty much sums it up."
7," Convoluted plot
",juliethood,/user/ur5232299/,12 November 2022,"It's a long film that dedicates a very large chunk of time to mourning the loss of Chadwick Boseman's character T'Challa. It tries very hard to have meaningful character development, but gets stuck in a rut of mourning even though time has passed. It's the overarching theme of the film, which is understandable considering who he was, but it appears to be more for the audiences benefit of mourning Chadwick, rather than the characters loss of thier king/brother/son.When it does get going there is far too much time spent focused on the processes behind all the technology that is being developed or built. Tech seems to be thier solution for everything. For us lesser mortals it can get boring if you don't understand it.In all it ends up with a convoluted plot with a telegraphed script. However, the new bad guy and his historic background was really good. He had a depth an perseption that could be empathised with. Which in some ways mirrors the introduction and backstory of Killmonger in the first film.All in all, great special effects and action sequences. Nice new villain character but not enough development for a scientist character that didn't add much to the story, she was just there as a plot device. Good progression for other core characters, especially M'Baku who I loved. Not as good as the first film, because none of the other characters make up for the loss of Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa. I gave it a solid 7/10 and would watch it again."
7," They should have recasted T'Challa
",ayyanahmadk,/user/ur147243014/,12 November 2022,This movie has failed to live up to the first movie. The wakanda in this movie is bland and has no depth unlike the first movie. The villian (Namor) needed more screen time and depth to his character than he had. The way they killed off T'Challa was really disappointing. They should have recasted the character even if it was for a few scenes and then kill him off. Other than that the movie felt slow in some scenes. There is also a plot I just think should not be in this movie. The action in this movie is great. And so is the jokes because they don't feel forced. But there are characters that should have seen more screen time. So I think this is a 7 out of 10.
8," A very good and mature MARVEL movie
",VasilisKalaitzis13,/user/ur122474707/,12 November 2022,To start with I appreciate that they don't try to create another dumb film which is made for 10 year olds and even 10 year olds find it stupid. For example Thor Love and Thunder or the She Hulk TV Series. The movie from the first moment till the post credit scene makes you feel the absence of T'Chala and either you liked him as Black Panther or not it makes you understand how important he was and how vulnerable wakanda is without him.CGIs: Many times cgis where fine or even very good but.... The moments that Namor rises from the ocean is tragic. More over I didn't like the car crash at that bridge in the first part of the movie.Performance: Most of the actors were quite good but Huerta (although I like him as an actor) wasn't so good. He didn't act badly but he wasn't as good as he should be.Now the lenght: In my opinion is quite big and it should be at least 10 to 20 minutes less. There are some very time consuming scenes that could be avoided or at least be smaller. However I prefer slow paced movie which has a scenario that makes sense and it is constantly building it than a fast paced movie which cuts important scenes and tries to build a scenario fast.I also loved that the film was based on traditions of either African or Mexican cultures. For example Talocan which is a place like paradise for the Aztecs or the symbols in Talocan's rooms which are Mayan script.Soundtrack: A unique soundtrack whose transitions where as smooth as they should be and it kept my eyes (and ears) concentrated at the boring parts of the movie.Last but propably not least: The fight at the end of the film takes place in the ocean. This is a mistake for many reasons. First of all making a battle in the ocean limits the ideas of how it could be evovlved. And going to Talocan makes the battle more difficult as the ocean belongs to the Talocan people and they belong there unlike wakandians. They could just wait for Namor to come again in Wakanda and face him there. And if they wanted to surprise him they should mention it at least once before they launch their attack.The end in my opinion was fine because Namor was a likeable character although he had some dark plans. The reason is that he and his people suffered in the past so he just wants revenge from the surface people. So when Shuri reasons him there is no reason to hate him or consider him as evil.In conclussion I believe that Wakanda Forever is a quite decent film and propably the best MARVEL project in phase 4 although it has some problems. From me is a 7.5/10.
7," Fitting tribute
",garynbuckley1-790-474406,/user/ur23533065/,12 November 2022,"As a marvel fan, was intrigued how they would handle Chadwick passing. Delicate and with much love. Everyone was invested in making this film a poignant and respectful legacy to the man himself. Genuine emotions on set must have been difficult, but it showed the true feelings of the cast and it showed in their performance. Some scenes were so real emotionally, that they put their hearts on the line. Truly fitting tribute and you felt Chadwick could have been overseeing it all. Marvel scores a winner, without too much action. End credits scene was out of character for marvel, but again true to The Real Black Panther."
9," One word - Beautiful!!!!!!
",niharika-29248,/user/ur102689418/,12 November 2022,"Idc what everyone else is gonna criticise the movie for, but when Marvel hits hard, it delivers.This movie was such a rollercoaster. Right from the very first frame, the movie carried itself all the way till the very end. And it ended phase 4, phase of dealing with grief.The Marvel intro scene featuring Chadwick Boseman was everything, no music no fanfare, just silence. This movie is definitely a tribute to the legend himself.The character arc of Shuri in this movie is so well written that it left me speechless towards the end. She goes from deep grief by throwing herself into research and technological development to love and empathy when Namor shows her his world, the n to grief again and this time channels it into anger before realising she doesn't want her people to pay for the vengeance she feels. I mean to show something like this in a 2hr 40 mins movie is extremely difficult but Coogler did it and it worked so well and is the central theme of the movie.The best part of this movie is how well they handled the civil conflict between two highly developed nations, each fighting for their own cause and in this due process we meet our Namor, and the writers did him justice and didn't underdo his character and yes he is the ferocious king and God who would go to any extents to protect his people. Tenoch Huerta did a marvelous job with the role and every time he refers to another of his people as ""My child"", my heart melted.And yes Miss RiRi Williams. First when Marvel announced Ironheart would be a part of this movie, i doubted to what extent her role would be in the movie. But the way they fit her into the most intricating plot and added her background story so well that yes I fell in love with her character. And it's a no wonder theatre went all crazy everytime she was in frame.Honestly this movie could even beat the Captain America Civil War, as this civil war felt more resonating and scarier.In a few words, What a movie to end this year with."
6," I thought Avatar: The way of water was coming out later...
",Shaaranya,/user/ur54606384/,12 November 2022,The movie is a little too long. The runtime should've been cut by 30 minutes. The first half is okay but the second half is too slow.The story around wakanda was weak. It's basically just people dying and others getting strength from it....which is basically every drama movie ever made. The movie lacks a strong storyline for the protagonists.Namor was great. His whole story about his past and his empire was very interesting. Felt refreshing to see a strong new bad guy from the comics enter the MCU. I lowkey wanted him to win :PBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever is a one-time watch but Marvel will really have to run their creative brains to find the success thet they're used to for Phase 4.
10," Best movie of all time
",bluedgaming,/user/ur157911030/,12 November 2022,This movie is best movie of all time and of MCU also. This movie contains all kind of emotions.that should be in a movie. The background song was insane i was getting goosebumps every time. The first half was kind of emotional but at the same time funny and full of action .The most important thing is that don't go on the reviews if you like the movie that is the best for you if you will see the reviews of every movie then you will not be able to see any movie cause there is always something missing in a movie and people are addicted to downgrade the movie.At last i wanna say that don't wait until this movie comes on T. V go watch it now its a masterpeice.
10," If you are a fan of Chadwick Boseman, you will definitely love the respect and justice given to the character
",hellishere-sjk,/user/ur23325059/,12 November 2022,"I believe recasting a character portrayed by someone as successfully as done by Chadwick Boseman is a difficult task. What is also difficult is to give a tribute and telling a story at the same time.What Marvel succeeded with this movie was to tell a story. A story hard and gripping that leaves the audience spellbound. Unlike previous Black Panther movie which was one man show (I totally loved the first movie) the creators decided to put some focus on other characters as well. The queen, Nakia, Shuri, Okoye, Mbaku were well represented. There character were given enough time in the screen for audience to empathize with them. The movie also put a lot of focus on Black Panther being a symbol but not a person and how heavy is the mantle of Black Panther.Recent Marvel releases like Thor4 and Dr. Strange 2 failed to tell a story and to develop a character. Recent TV Series has been nothing less than shambolic. This is a saviour for Marvel which was able tell a story and build characters. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever has one of the strongest performance by the cast that I have seen in Marvel. Every characters were given good story and every actor performed it beautifully.I would highly recommend people to watch it. This is one of those movies were a Hero goes through a arc that it deserves."
10," BEST FILM THAT THEY COULD MAKE!
",Arhhaan,/user/ur112333793/,12 November 2022,"Quick Review!Black Panther:
Wakanda Forever
Probably the most emotional Marvel movie to date and it did it so well.The main strength of this movie was the way they handled
Chadwick Boseman's passing and the amazing amount of respect they gave him and his character.There are no weak links in the cast, but I have to give a special shoutout to Angela Basset and Letitia Wright's Shuri. Letitia is quite the beating heart of this film.Dominique Thorne as
Riri Williams did a fabulous job.Tenoch huerta as
Namor,
loved his performance throughout the film.Ryan Coogler again showed he is one of the best director.Also the Casting team did a tremendous job."
8," Rest in Peace, Chadwick Boseman
",nizarsalim,/user/ur139489183/,12 November 2022,"In Black Panther Wakanda Forever, what deserves praise is the performaces of the cast, soundtrack, direction, cinematography, CGI, emotional weight, (SPOILER) Shuri becoming Black Panther, ending, in which (SPOILER) T'challa's son appears, and most importantly, the tribute to Boseman. May he rest in peace.But regarding the flaws, the movie, from my point of view, has some flaws that cannot be easily ignored, first, the 161 minutes runtime, which was, from my perspective, a little bit long and boring, second, the action scenes, which could have been better and more exciting, and third, and story, which I expected it to be better and deeper.But despite of these flaws, I can't say that I didn't like Black Panther. I liked it, and I am excited to see (again, SPOILER) Shuri's Black Panther future in the MCU. When it comes to the score, I give Black Panther Wakanda Forever 8 out of 10."
1," WOW Marvel FUMBLED TERRIBLY on this one!
",jwhxsgjz,/user/ur156659781/,12 November 2022,"This movie was very disappointing in many ways. For starters marvel changed the entire black panther comic script all so that they could introduce a female version. I hate to say this but Shuri, black panthers sister in this case did a terrible job as the new black panther. It really felt like they tried so hard to milk wakanda and black panther in this film. THEY LITERALLY SHOWED the new BLACK PANTHER IN THE SUIT FOR ONLY 20 MINUTES OF THE ENTIRE MOVIE DURATION OF 2 HOURS AND 41 MINUTES. I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND this film. The villain which isn't really a villain Namor hard carried this entire film without him this movie would've been even worst! Also worst marvel superhero ending/ end credits. It's literally shuri crying and then they pull the worst child support card. They went so OFF SCRIPT TO MAKE THIS ""TRIBUTE BLACK PANTHER"" film that to many who actually read the comics know how bad marvel fumbled on this one. I'm usually a big marvel fan but the had so much filler on this movie and for how bad they went off script to please a certain audience is truly sad and an L on behalf of marvel."
1," Movie was released to make money not actual sense
",awaisdar-50440,/user/ur132301916/,12 November 2022,"I have seen many horrible movies, and this one makes the list for sure. Started out more of a memorial of Chadwick, added in some horrible fight scenes, a plot that had so many holes like what was the purpose of the fight with the villian and also how can the villian be so easily defeated by turning on the heat ? And how does the black panther survive a stabbing from a spear with stronger vibranium than wakandas? The ending made no sense, they become allies. I think marvel just wanted to sell tickets to compete against DC this year and figured why not do a half way job. Marvel needs to develop better stories than focus on action."
7," Thus Ends Phase Four
",dorMancyx,/user/ur125833174/,12 November 2022,"So much has been expected from Wakanda Forever, as the first peek into the notorious Namor alongside his Empire Atlantis (or Taloca according to modification), as the conclusion to Marvel's phase four, and as a final farewell to our forever Black Panther - Chadwick Boseman. How can any superhero movie possibly achieve all these while narrating a unique, emotive, and memorable story?In the first five minutes of the film, the Black Panther we used to know is dead, with neither a scene shown nor a reason explained: so fast, so sudden, so unfair, and yet so powerful just like how the tragic news struck us in reality. Though T'Challla's gone, his legacy remains in the impact of Wakanda's foreign diplomacy, which directly causes the surfacing of a second vibranium-wielding kingdom. Moreover, the trauma of king's decease pervades throughout the movie as an unspoken while defining thread that sews all fundamental motives, further influencing the plot progression, character development, and overall theme, that is, ""how and why we should keep moving onward"".Through the near explosive performance of Angela Bassett, we see the majesty of a regal monarch, the apprehension of a childless guardian, and the anguish of a lost mother from every of Ramonda's glare, bellow, and forbearance. Nothing afflicts more ache than hearing the queen howling about Shuri's abduction and exposing her vulnerability as a helpless parent. However, Ramonda's unduly defensive approach to the safety of her own nation and daughter is, substantively, negligence over the problems effected by Wakanda, costing her life in hands of those equally tormented by T'Challa. Shuri, logically the most qualified successor of the throne, is mentally the least eligible inheritor of Black Panther. As seen in previous movies, Shuri is but a kid, who knows not the grief of bereavement, the duty as a protector, or the answer to vengeance - for a long while, Shuri is almost possessed by Killmonger's retaliatory identity. Despite the quick revival of conscience, the princess is, at the utmost, aware of her royal responsibilities and upholds benevolence at heart. Shuri may not be the most right Black Panther, but she is a Black Panther.Personally, I'm not too invested in Riri Williams, especially due to Ironheart's so-called title as the second Iron Man - Marvel already has a young, talented, red-suited hero whose name is not to be recalled and is also very much the replacement for Tony. Additionally, with all due respect, Ironheart's armor looks like the talking toy robot I got for Christmas 11 years ago. Bearing much suspense, Namor, one of the most iconic Marvel comic characters, makes his much-anticipated entrance in the film. Without a doubt, the depiction of Taloca is ravishing: exotic environmental designs, opaque underwater sceneries, and aesthetically fascinating costumes all mark the unparalleled charisma of this novel civilization. Though the unquestionable antagonist of the story, all of Namor's decisions and actions are perfectly reasoned, as if to challenge the scale of justice and ethics. In my opinion, if the Kukulkan can be portrayed with a bit more guile and hypocrisy, the character would have more depth and dynamic just like in the comics.Another thing to be complimented is the score composed by the amazing Ludwig GÃ¶ransson, utilizing a repetition of yelps to demonstrate the stealth of intruders and the sidling of conflict. One mesmerizing employment of music is the Talocan sonic weapon, which comprises the soft yet piercing humming that blends in unnoticeably with the background, as when the audience recognizes its effect, the attack has already sent the passengers offboard. However, I'd still like to have the original Black Panther theme - the full-of-African-vibe drum beats - used in later Black Panther movies.Thus ends phase four of Marvel: arguably a not-so-satisfying period mostly eliciting the inheritance of Avengers. There is perceptible foreshadowing of future content sprinkled throughout this journey, including De Fonte's maneuvering behind several major incidents, and Werewolf by Night's presentation of a mystical realm. Overall, hopefully phase five could connect some if not all of the countless storylines and pave a thrilling road to Avengers 5 and 6."
8," A Lovely Tribute
",ahmed-abou-hussein,/user/ur32792371/,12 November 2022,"I think the movie dealt smartly and respectfully with the death of Chadwick Boseman. The first half of the movie is an intelligent and artistic display that makes you forget that it's a marvel movie. Ryan Coogler is probably the best director out there to touch the crowd's emotions without being exploitive.Angela Bassett gave a phenomenal performance. Her performance as a mother who is aching for the loss of her son and yet maintain the dignity and pride to lead a broken hearted nation and face a greedy colonial world was nothing short of imperious. Black Panther's villains are always very well developed as characters. Tenoch Huerta didn't disappoint. I was intrigued to see if he'd struggle succeeding MBJ's Killmonger but he doesn't. His performance conveyed an amazing emotional side and yet it had this menacing aspect to it. Danai Gurira is a giant in this movie. She just has this amazing spectrum where she can make you laugh or emotional without losing the dignified embodiment of the Wakandan general. Winston Duke is a fine actor and I loved his performance in this movie. The character also developed and matured. He shows you that while keeping it's sense of humour and flair.However, there was something missing in this movie and I am not sure if it's because of the circumstances or because Marvel is focusing too much on its ""formula"" which has been harming the franchise lately.Without going into too much details, the movie had a chance to show a very different type of Black Panther but it refrained from it. I think there was a golden opportunity for that with Letitia being different and having her own troubled character rather than a purist one. Letitia Wright has been an amazing Shuri. She nailed her role in this movie and delivered an amazing grieved sister who's trying to move on and doesn't know how to. However, I think transcending to the Black Panther role didn't feel like a natural fit. I think this is because in all previous movies her role focused more on the science aspect rather than the field aspect of Wakandan operations. I might be biased but I think Lupita Nyong'o's energy and kick ass character would have been more suitable. Lupita's charisma and the way her character has been displayed from day one as someone who's portrayed as an equal and a hero makes it an easier transition. I know that Chadwick Boseman and MBJ made it very difficult for anyone to wear that suit but I think Lupita would have been the perfect successor. I know that in the comics Shuri becomes the panther but there had already been deviations from the comics, so why not?The other missed opportunity was the last fighting scene. Without spoiling the movie, you don't expect that the two most advanced nations would have such a limited budget combat to be honest.Finally, the movie is great! It's Marvel's best in a long time. The performances are powerful. The music is amazing. The worlds imagined would make you wish they existed for real. The movie must be watched in a theatre experience. Loved it!"
10," Going to say it... Better than the first one!
",garethwooduk,/user/ur76271796/,12 November 2022,"Sequels are always hard to live up to the hype of a successful first movie and with the exception of its leading character & much loved and missed cast member 'Chadwick Boseman' sadly passing away.But in Wakanda Forever they've brilliant incorporated his loss showing lots of genuine affection and raw emotion within its story.This is art imitating life and how do they carry on with the loss of their much loved King T'Challa 'Black Panther'No spoilers but a big part of the movie there is no Black Panther even with other threats outside their realm.The story at its core is brilliant, compassionate, action through out and with its is brilliant cast at large, loved it!"
7," A Worthy Sequel (Even With Its Flaws)
",iplagerquist96,/user/ur26244251/,12 November 2022,"There is a lot about the movie to love. Every minute spent on the core characters are phenomenal. Shuri and Ramonda are the two standouts that deliver consistent and top tier quality acting scene after scene. Namor is a solid antagonist that I want to see more of in the future. The way the story in the movie follows the real world reaction to the death of Chandwick Bozeman is well executed.Having the characters caught off guard like us is a great way for the audience to immediately connect with character's experience. Their are some things that don't work though. Iron Heart should have been introduced in another movie or at the very least had a quick introduction in Wakanda Forever and then had time to develop in a different movie (similar to the MCU Spider-Man). Their are some odd choices with pacing which can sometimes take away from certain characters decisions.Overall I like this movie and at the same time love parts of it as well. Is it as good as the first? Probably not, but it's still a good and worthy sequel."
9," Hell of a smart and gorgeous follow-up
",fraser-simons,/user/ur37365377/,12 November 2022,"This new phase is killing it. I'm sure die hard fans are annoyed but this is way more interesting than I expected, just like The Eternals. For one: showing the complexity of colonization with two uncolonized nations and having people trying to get at their resources is compelling enough. Then, we also have the grief plot tying in really well via the critical thinking between nation states being fallible with the spectre of colonization over them, driving the fear. The resolution and accountability involved was perfect too.On top of that you have another gorgeous production, fantastic acting, and wonderful colour palette. There's not that many fantastic Marvel movies. Most of them are fun, but a bit dumb. This is intelligent and and fun, a rare thing in super hero flicks. Or is this new phase ending pandering and going for a much more interesting direction? Hope so!The only thing I actually didn't like was the comedy relief with Freeman and Elaine from Seinfeld. Coulda deleted that right out of there and it'd have been even better."
10," Emotional, Powerful, and Mindblowing.
",Lynx5567-21248,/user/ur70660583/,12 November 2022,"This is simply a 10/10. From the way they opened the movie with the heartbreaking T'Challa's death to closing it out with T'Challa's child in the end. I have never cried before once in my life from watching a movie until this movie. The Michael B. Jordan scene was completely unexpected, and I love how a ton of scenes were filmed in Cambridge, which is near where I am from.The attack on Wakanda was definitely something, and the way they portrayed Ramonda's death at the end of the scene was completely disturbing. Furthermore, there were some comedic scenes involved but only to a point, which is what should happen, especially in such a dark film like this.Overall, this is the best movie of the year, and it undoubtedly had a lot to convey towards the audience. It is something that people relate to as they lose a loved one from any natural causes and then it teaches them how to cope and it motivates them to pursue whatever they want in the end."
8," Wakanda Forever
",ColinTheGorilla,/user/ur150398104/,12 November 2022,Starting off with this movie I didn't have that much expectations and didn't think it could be super good. But I truly did enjoy this movie and loved a ton of the new characters introduced throughout like Namor and Riri Williams. There are some flaws with this film though like I think they stretched this movies length time out a long time. I also believe that the storyline was quite predictable at times. But I did enjoy this movie other than a few flaws with it. I think this movie isn't going to be for everyone but for me I truly did enjoy this film and I recommend it to anyone who watched to have a good time.
8," Better than the first!
",advancedshrubbr,/user/ur153665794/,12 November 2022,"Before I start I think it's good to give context for my thoughts on the first Black Panther film. I fall in the minority that likes the film but thinks it is mega overrated. I like the general direction and tone of the film but it has too many small problems that keep me from loving it as much as everyone else.With that said, I honestly loved this film. The visuals are haunting and epic, the score triumphant, and h the performance perfect. This sequel has a lot on its shoulders. It's a tribute to Chadwick Bosemen, on top of being a celebration of the character that he brought to life, while being a sequel to the film that brought him to life. And on all levels it's working phenomenally.Before I start gushing I had a few minor problems that keep me from giving it a perfect score. I think some of the story beats needed some more time to breathe, especially at the end of the final battle. The US politics feels like stuff marvel shoved in for a cameo and excuse for why Bilbo is in the movie. Riri Williams is also fun, but doesn't add to the story in a particularly major way. She functions most as a Macguffin that the Wakandans need to keep safe, but other than that she doesn't add to Shuri's arc beyond Riri also losing family members.The editing is also hit or miss. For the most part it's good but some shots needed to last a little longer for the impact they want. Some CGI shots were also a little iffy, but for the most part this is the most consistently great MCU movie for cgi.Now for the great stuff. The acting in this film is so damn good. There isn't a single actor not putting in their all for these roles. Even M'Baku who takes more of a back seat for comedy relief has some really good scenes with Shuri.Angela Basset is phenomenal in every scene she is in. Her performance is guttural and emotional beyond belief. There is not a scene she is in where you wonder what emotion she is going for. Tenoch Huerta is also a wonderful antagonist. Every word out of his mouth is dripping with emotion.The standout of the movie for me was Letitia Wright as Shuri. I was cautiously optimistic regarding her role in the movie, especially with the twitter controversy regarding Letitia's views on vaccines. However, she kills every scene she is in. Her performance is one of the best in recent marvel history.Visually the movie is easily the best looking Marvel movie. At this point, it's easy to point out the Marvel formula when it comes to visual design and cinematography. Many bland, grey shots with little interesting camera movement. The more recent tries at breaking this formula, notably Multiverse of Madness and Eternals, have ultimately doubled back and returned to the safe gray color palette for multiple, if not all, scenes.This film breaks every marvel cinematography rule. The lighting is dramatic and distinct, the camerawork excellently framed, and the direction phenomenal. Ryan Coogler and the d.p. Autumn Durald Arkapaw knocked it out of the park.I also want to give a special shoutout to the sound design. It would be incredibly easy to just go with the most generic sound effects, especially with the Atlantans. However, the sound design whenever a scene goes underwater is gorgeous. The artists behind every sound effect deserve all the awards.Another notable aspect was how toned down the Marvel brand of humor was. I found most of the humor in this one far better written and inserted than most Marvel movies. It also has the fewest overall amount of jokes in a Marvel movie that I've seen. Eternals comes close, but every joke in that movie felt like a Feigi mandated insert than a genuine natural attempt at humor.Overall I really love this movie. Even though I don't love the first, I can see clear signs of improvement here. If you can go see it in the theaters. It is definitely worth a watch."
2," Wakanda Forever and Ever and Ever Weep Weep Cry Cry and Ever
",mrjolly-97034,/user/ur147111417/,12 November 2022,"Love seeing the actors and the characters that they played. They were great. The script had long drawn-out conversation that didn't add to the story line. Story timing was off in a few places where one thing was built in two months but another more highly developed thing was built in three days. No developing scenes for some new characters that seemed thrown into the story. Some of the green screen shots reminded me of the superhero movies from the 80's. At one point I felt that I was watching a foreign film because of all the sub-titles, which didn't allow me to actually watch the film. My girl and I have agreed to stop watching Marvel movies in the theaters until they pull themselves out of their nosedive by finding better writers and directors."
6," Marvel still can't find the way
",gvotteler,/user/ur147785957/,12 November 2022,"Simple resume :
2.5 hours of tribute that is important but not that long, a bad villain with a story that doesn't work reminds a little of aquaman, a black panther that doesn't stand out, marvel still has a long way to go to return to a line of stories at the level of the previous phases, which catch the viewers, there are good interpretations but there are also things that remain empty and with the duration of the film, better ideas would have been developed. Besides, if you stay for the post-credits, you're going to waste your time... a scene that doesn't say much and another that doesn't exist.It was great for marvel to make good movies, and it's not for heroes because this choice of thor4 is a fiasco."
6," Not the same feeling.. Sadly
",opefas,/user/ur43513903/,12 November 2022,Saw Wakanda forever and definitely didn't have the same elation and excitement i had coming out of the Original Black Panther movie. Yes there were some nice fights as well as the lovely visuals of Wakanda and Namors city but story wise it just wasnt as gripping. Found myself checking my watch and wondering when it would end. Angela Basset was awesome. Didnt see the need for Iron heart in this movie but o well they had to introduce a new character similar to what they did in Dr strange MoM with Ms America.Tribute to Chadwick was lovely and choice of songs for the soundtracks were also awesome but the story could have been so much better. There were some plot holes that didn't make sense else i may have given it a 7 stead of a 6. Really hope Marvel hasnt lost the magic. Overall its an okay watch but I'm not certain if i wanna go back and see it again. Rather watch the first one again.
2," A Wasted Opportunity
",El_hangman,/user/ur3288578/,12 November 2022,"Being a wannabe writer I thought how fun it would be to write an Invaders script. Namor has been a staple in Marvel, and a hugely important character. Bill Everett created the character in 1939. He's fought with Captain America and the first Human Torch in WWII.This reimagination is absolutely awful! Why bother even calling him Namor? Why not just make a new character at this point as nothing, from the back story, the meaning of the name, even where he is from, is different. He doesn't even act like he does in the comics.Way to completely disrespect a character that's been around for over 80 years. For shame, Marvel.Now lets look at the rest of the story. I love movies, especially Marvel movies. I nearly fell asleep twice during this movie. Besides the end, there is very little action. It's long and drawn out, very boring.Chadwick Bosemen is a great actor and will be missed, but they really should have just recast him. Made for a terribly predictable story line and character developments. Like, really bad, in so many places.Very disappointed in Marvel for this one."
10," Grief and Pain
",roboneill1991,/user/ur46279355/,12 November 2022,"I urge you to reflect on this movie before reviewing and rating and after you do that, do it some more. Never has a movie shown grief like this so true and so real. Powerful after powerful performance.. from the strength of Angela Bassett's Ramonda and Letitia Wrights Shuri to Lupita Nyong'o's Nakia's softness the range of mourning pain and loss washes over this film and pays tribute to the legacy of Chadwick Boseman. One of the best villans in recent Marvel history rounds out this film to make it not just another chapter in the MCU but a standout film about grief, family, love, loss and history that should be seen world over. Ignore any negative reviews and run to see this as soon as you can. From the 1st scene until the very end you'll know why this isn't to be missed."
3," A crying shame
",lockdown11,/user/ur42782990/,12 November 2022,"This sequel is a crying shame. They did Chadwick Boseman dirty by killing Black Panther off screen by a covid-like disease. Instead of going out like a KING they had no representation of the man whatsoever. Anyone that is calling this a great tribute or legacy is a fool. There's none of that here!Every single powerful male figure like in the previous film is reduced to a buffoon or completely emasculated, especially Namor whose origin was completely changed for some unknown reason.This is a complete travesty to young black males and young boys of color. So much praise was heaped upon the role model that Black Panther was and they threw all that away in the blink of an eye. Good luck bringing your kid to the movie only to watch their hero die unceremoniously off screen in the first 10 minutes. Everyone involved in creating this should be ashamed of themselves for ruining the legacy of Black Panther and the powerful statement that the first movie was.That said, it was simply a bad movie with awful character choices throughout. The Queen could have avoided the invasion completely by working with Namor when he came to her for help. Shuri attempted to save the life of an enemy but was unnecessarily stopped which was seen as an act of war. She's also incapable of carrying a movie on her own so not sure why they're trying to force her on us.Ironheart and her ridiculous armor was a joke but everybody knew that already going into it.2022 and the best they could do is generic Power Rangers. Her show will probably be as awful as the rest of the phase 4 shows. Okoye's armor was goofy as well.Disney just stop and go back to what made Marvel great because this is just trash. No wonder Disney stock is tanking. First they destroy Star Wars and now they're doing a wonderful job of destroying Marvel."
10," Truly a cinematic masterpiece
",jaydabuaphanhuskiescute,/user/ur147184027/,12 November 2022,"I absolutely loved the movie! You can tell it was most definitely NOT rushed. The cgi and the visuals were amazing.I loved the characters and their line delivery.The plot and storyline was amazing, and the movie really captures that and perfectly explains it!I love how it can be serious and funny without having too much of both.Some parts may start getting boring, and they know this so they start putting action, and I love it! They acknowledge when their movie starts getting boring, and turn it into exciting! And that was only one part/scene, the rest of the movie was totally NOT boring at all."
7," Descent character work**** Terms and conditions apply.
",ashishpeddada,/user/ur77592541/,12 November 2022,"So let's first get the bad things out of the way. The scientist. I am all for female empowerment. But when you say a 19 year old built an iron man suit with literally no money. She built 4 quantum computers just to get into her 2048 bit encrypted computer. And she built her first machine when she was freakin 3 years old ! These lines didn't have to be there but are, for exposition. It just makes it really hard to like such people ! I get it that's how Tony stark was ! But not every smart person needs to be like Tony Stark ! My goodness! His ego was literally the worst part of him. But he got better! The scientist just didn't. She was basically a tool to move the plot forward and the film needed a strong and ideal female ideal character to pander to the feminists I guess. So there she was ! With that out of the way.Chadwick Boseman's passing was handled in the most gracious way possible. The movie is about processing the loss of a loved one. And it was very evident throughout. It's about a family that has to take up the role of a dead person but they are still unwilling to process they are gone. And each of the casts acting was the very best. Ramonda's ""Have I not given everything"" line was delivered with so much perfection that it had a huge impact despite seeing it in trailers. Shuri has had all the makings of a true superhero that is born with tragedy and it's what helps her empathize in the end. The exchange between Umbaku and Shuri was powerful too. You talk about my mother's dreams like she were here. But she isn't. Okeye was both a comedic relief and a powerful character at the same time.The villain had some good qualities in the beginning I thought where I assumed he would be complicated and all. But in the end he turns into I will destroy the world typical MCU villain so ! Doesn't matter. We spent 20 minutes on the guy's back story. Didn't need that much just to become just an other villain. In fact if he had seen foreigners come and take their lands it's all the more reason for you to not do the same thing with Wakanda. That's just hypocrisy.So all in all ! Very weird movie ! It's a very weird mix of extremely good character work and extremely bad character work. But I thank god Shuri didn't end up like the scientist. Which based on their track record I was just expecting! Ahem She hulk , Captain Marvel."
7," Good and necessary
",PedroPires90,/user/ur26163020/,12 November 2022,"Given the circumstances, it was difficult to do better. WF really had to explore emptiness, loss, grief, and feelings in depth. It does this quite well with several emotionally moving moments and excellent dialogue throughout the film. In doing so we knew this would have to affect somewhere and it happened plotwise that doesn't go as deep and is not as coherent as desirable, although I liked Namor as much as the new culture represented. Talking about acting, Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, and Lupita Nyong'o are all standouts.In the technical fields, it's even a better film than the 1st. Personally, I loved the score (harmonic elements of the two cultures that perfectly complement each other). The visual effects are better, the sound great, and the production design, hairstyling, and make-up are at a similar level (not impressed by the aquatic world though).In addition to some interesting dark elements, final praise for the use of subtle humor that, once again, contrasts with the typical cheesy humor - pausing for audience laughs - that the MCU uses so much in other films. Not as good as the first, but a necessary film that manages to ensure the continuity of the franchise on a positive note."
8," 7.8 Wakanda Forever Indeed
",beavecoon1,/user/ur44879395/,12 November 2022,"Wow, incredible start to the movie. They respected the great late Chadwick Boseman well in this movie. The acting of his loss in the movie hit very hard because you know those actors were feeling real pain. We lost an icon in Chadwick Boseman and they did not try to beat around the bush but honored his life.Shuri (Letitia Wright) in this movie takes over. She owns the role and has raw and powerful emotion. The overall plot was overshadowed by the respect being shown and I believe it suffered a tad bit. It was rather predictable a lot of the time which is why it's not higher for me. The action was great throughout but did not love how the final fight scene ended. This movie is a much watch imo!!"
9," It's Surprisingly good!!!
",bsukhsvasti,/user/ur157242944/,12 November 2022,"I wonder how it's gonna be after Chadwick Boseman passed. I think they did a good job on story line, emotional but not depressed. I like the visual efxfect especially under water scene. It makes Aquaman look like a Sunday morning cartoon. Angela Bassett kickass big time. I don't like the way it ended a bit too corny but I respect the writer's view point. A bit strange that there's no cameo from Marvel Universe at all, there should be someone come to help Wakanda when needed coz they were in the war against Thanos. Another thing that I like about the story line is it make America look like a selfish prick. I think this film is the 1st one who do that hahaha!!!"
1," Movie sucked
",ac-14660,/user/ur114947345/,12 November 2022,"Movie sucked. It was too long I was disappointed with the movie it was the worst marvel movie of 2022. They should not have had a girl panther in there only showed her for 10 minutes and they should've brought back Michael B Jordan as a panther in the movie was too depressing and Disney did not do a good job with Chadwick Boseman's tribute and if you want to do some thing, do something better than going to see this movie, don't waste your time with it and the bad guys it kind of reminded you of avatar a little bit and the good guys are out numbered that's what was more upsetting about it. The trailer was better then actually movie."
9," Emotional Epic and marvelous
",iamrein,/user/ur150459984/,12 November 2022,"A very well wrap. All the cast members were at their best.At first I lose hope since phase four hasn't been going great. But I thought let's give it a try. After all it's a tribute film. And yes, Black Panther 2 didn't disappoint. Watching a film without our Chadwick yet we feel his presence in the entire film. I love how the film is respectfully done. I am very much looking forward to how it will go as so many stories unfold later on in the MCU. I love Wakanda and I can't wait for what's to come next and I hope each future films are wrapped with excitement, intense and loving. Till then, let's have some hope. WAKANDA FOREVER!"
5," There is a Chadwick Boseman-shaped hole in the heart of Wakanda.
",cricketbat,/user/ur6201371/,12 November 2022,"There is a Chadwick Boseman-shaped hole in the heart of Wakanda. While this film offers a lovely tribute to King T'Challa and the man who played him, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever feels like it's missing something (which is kind of funny, because the runtime is far too long). Even Shuri (Letitia Wright), who was one of my favorite parts of the first Black Panther movie, becomes a dull, brooding character in this sequel. Watching this was an almost joyless experience, despite the forced humor. Phase Four of the MCU has been a bit of mess, so I was hoping it would end strong. Unfortunately, it didn't."

",ernestobladins,/user/ur47239420/,12 November 2022,"Pros of the movie: Dora Milage are badass, i love Okoye, Namor (The villian), Soundtrack is great like in the first movie, the actress playing the queen was so good, Mbaku always cool, and the movie takes itself seriously which is breath of fresh air after thor 4, and she hulk...Cons: IronHeart´s suit is ridiculous, i hope thye improve it. The length of this movie is a bit too long, felt like i was watching the extended version, rather than the theatrical version, and some of the shots in talokan were kinda dark, could have been more lit.The actress playing the new black panther has a nice compelling arc and makes me root for her as a hero woth being called a hero because of her choice, and not just acll her a hero because she has veen given superpowers."
7," What a Cast
",firedncr83,/user/ur19382830/,12 November 2022,"As someone still reeling from Chadwick Boseman's untimely death, I was hesitant to see this movie. In that regard, this movie was such a beautiful tribute to such a beautiful soul that it was hard to have enough tissues on hand. Ryan Coogler truly made an ever-lasting and truly heartfelt memorial for Boseman in this film that was respectful, endearing, and genuine. This cannot be overstated.The plot itself was a bit inconsistent. First, it's nearly impossible to make an underwater movie look good. Even the backing of the MCU couldn't achieve this, but honestly, it's because it's not possible. Every single live action movie set underwater looks like trash. It's one of the reasons it's so rarely done. This movie was no exception. The strange scenes of underwater grottos achieved the same exact effect of every other movie with a similar setting- it was, undeniably, silly and cinematically cringey. The holes in the consistency of the plot are glaring and it often moves at a bit of a glacial pace.All of that being said, the cast of this movie cannot be praised enough. The performances were nothing short of breathtaking from a cast that is mostly black, female, and commanding. To say it was refreshing to watch is the understatement of the century. These women delivered such nuanced performances that anything less than an Oscar for each would be a slap in the face.As is par for the MCU, the cinematography was devine and the graphics unparalleled (save the underwater scenes). What has really stuck with me is the acting. It was so well done that the plot holes and inconsistencies were merely background noise.I cannot laud this cast enough. And, while I am sure I cannot imagine what filming without Boseman must have been like, I feel certain his legacy will thrive because these women persevered to give us the closure we all still needed."
5," Missed the mark
",rmarli17,/user/ur46134292/,12 November 2022,"It did a great job of honoring the late Chadwick Boseman however I'd say that was the only good parts. The reason behind Namors motives don't make sense. Typical/predictable storyline and what upset me the most is during a time when the movie should be about unity and solidarity they decide to call the one useful white guy a ""colonizer."" Who did he colonize? How do you know he's a colonizer? Or are you just calling him that because of the color of his skin? If Chadwick were alive he wouldn't have put up with that. Probably won't see another marvel movie in theaters again. I've read the comics but I realize these no longer follow the comics but I no longer feel connected to these characters."
6," Disappointing but not bad
",palco-53821,/user/ur78867567/,12 November 2022,"If you think of Black Panther in his context, being a movie and universe which represented a cultural phenomenon, this sequel is disappointing. Bad fights, not impressive visually, not even one outstanding character and performance, and a bad bad argumented conflict and ending. Nonetheless, if you think of it as just a movie outside that context, which is hard to do due to the performance and memories of Chadwick Boseman, it's an okay, acceptable movie. It also felt like the film lacked identity, but to be honest, this was just such a big challenge for Ryan Coogler, and i dont think he necessarily handed it all badly."
9," A Royal Tribute
",Smellman426,/user/ur82055986/,12 November 2022,"I was wary at first when it was announced that 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' was continuing on after the passing of Chadwick Boseman. However, I believe that the movie was a solid tribute, and great movie overall. In my opinion, what also helped, is that (thankfully), the movie took a much more serious tone than the last few entries in the MCU, allowing for more deeper storytelling with less focus on humor. The new characters introduced are some nice additions too. My only real grievance is that the movie is a bit too long, but I never felt it got to the point where I kept checking the time over and over. Marvel took their time with this movie, and it paid off."
7," Moderately entertaining
",steveinadelaide,/user/ur25255776/,12 November 2022,"BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER is less than the sum of its parts. Despite a strong cast and some impressive action sequences, the film feels disjointed and fails to live up to the potential of its source material.The plot picks up shortly after the death of King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), with Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett), Shuri (Letitia Wright), M'Baku (Winston Duke), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and the Dora Milaje fighting to protect Wakanda from intervening world powers. As the Wakandans strive to embrace their next chapter, the heroes must band together with the help of War Dog Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) and Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) to forge a new path for the kingdom.While there are some well-choreographed action sequences, lots of diversity in the cast, and the different worlds are spectacular, they are not enough to make up for the film's other shortcomings. The plot is disjointed and predictable, and the film fails to explore the rich world of Wakanda instead opting for fast-paced action that feels empty.The movie includes a couple of respectful references to Chadwick Boseman who died after the filming of the previous movie. None of them feels gratuitous or out of place.BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER is a missed opportunity that fails to live up to the potential of its source material.WAKANDA FOREVER is moderately entertaining but disappoints. Fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe may want to check it out, but everyone else can skip it."

",rotten-potatoes,/user/ur92159142/,12 November 2022,"I liked this movie, but I believe for the wrong reason.The bad is, it's very female driven, which is not a bad thing but I mean with the well known characters absence it just left a large void that was not met. It was a pretty sad movie at times, not in a dark way but in a very grieving manner. And finally I was not sold on a new character. The new character was a total swing and miss and literally added nothing to the film.The good is, namor namor namor. Deserve own movie in my opinion. That aspect of the movie literally made the film. Lastly shuri (letitia Wright) did an excellent job. She is a fine actress.But in conclusion I don't think the featured character is usually allowed to steal the show, I personally think that's an indictment of this film. I definitely suggest seeing it for yourself and coming to own conclusion however."
10," Nothing short of spectacular.
",topherdrewpg,/user/ur90998310/,12 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/10I'll preface this by stating that I do NOT understand the mixed reviews. There is not one element of this that I would've done differently.This 2-hour-and-41-minute epic had me hooked from start to finish. No other Marvel property in my opinion, particularly in Phase 4, can match this level of quality, and that's in no small part due to Ryan Coogler, Angela Bassett, Letitia Wright, and the incredibly talented (not to mention gorgeous) newcomer Tenoch Huerta.The talent on display in *every single element* of this film is going to be tough to match, even from next month's Avatar: The Way of Water.Speaking of Avatar 2, they now have some SERIOUS competition in EVERY Oscar category next year, thanks to this film. I could honestly see this sweeping every category and making a strong play for Best Picture.The acting: Fantastic. Angela Bassett is magnificent. Letitia Wright is wonderful. Tenoch Huerta brings a depth to his Namor that is rare in any film, much less a Marvel one.I believe he is perhaps an even better incarnation of the already-deep Killmonger from the first film. It's hard not to see the world from his perspective at least once.The technical craft: Spectacular. I haven't wanted to visit a new world so badly (the underwater world of Talokan) since the first Black Panther sent me to Wakanda and the first Avatar sent me to Pandora. It. Is. Breathtaking.The score: Unparalleled. Ludwig Goransson has outdone himself with this. It's even better than the first film. It's my favorite score for a movie in years.The writing and direction: Masterful. Ryan Coogler deserves recognition for elevating this DRAMATICALLY above anything else offered up in Marvel's mixed-bag Phase 4. Coogler manages to make an above-par Marvel epic that has meaningful things to say about loss, grief, sisterhood, motherhood, friendship, and moving on, while also ending on a POWERFUL and prescient note about how nations should treat each other in this post-modern world we all inhabit.What else is there to say? I loved every minute of it."
7," Best you can do with the circumstances
",chavezanthony115,/user/ur31000926/,12 November 2022,"I didn't like the first one, but liked certain characters. With the passing of Chadwick Boseman a huge hurdle had to be overcome. Unfortunately all the older characters charcter development was bad because of this situation and the director/writer not knowing what to do with them. Namor steals the show and is by far the saving grace of the movie, without his performance the movie could have been the worst in MCU history, not at any fault of the director or writer since they were put in a very tough position. Should have made a Namor movie instead to be frank. Without the passing of Chadwick Boseman i think this movie could have been something special."

",matthewgkeehan,/user/ur53534129/,12 November 2022,"So Namor hates ""colonisers"" for their greed and violence, yet doesn't seem to acknowledge his people's bloodthirst for human sacrifice.

Great music. Lush visuals.Hated IronHeart. Quite the contrast between sophisticated black Wakandan culture and thug Brooklyn street hood childishness.

6," Better than expect
",jjakum-96413,/user/ur71469810/,12 November 2022,"This was probably the best non-Spider-Man product the MCU has put out since Endgame. There was a solid tribute to Chadwick Boseman. Letitia Wright did a really good job stepping into the lead. I was fully expecting to hate Namor but I walked away pleasantly surprised by the portrayal.The complaints I have are that it was about 45 minutes longer than it needed to be. I found myself getting bored at points. I also could have done without Riri. Her character seemed unnecessary and Tony stark will always be Iron Man. Also, some of the CGI was absolutely terrible. Some of the underwater scenes looked like a PS 2 game.Overall, I liked it. Not sure if I would need to see it again though."
5," I loved the ending, otherwise so many mixed feelings
",Mike_Noga,/user/ur7625363/,12 November 2022,"This is the most divisive Marvel movie I've ever watched. Some good parts, a lot that just fizzle and too many ideas not handled well.I started out biased against this movie because I didn't like that they did not recast T'Challa. I've been a Panther fan since the 70s and there are tons of great Panther stories left to be told.But when it comes to the movie we did get, I have to say that the movie started out treating T'Challa very shabbily. He dies an off screen death from a mysterious illness that is never mentioned again. He deserved to at least die in battle, defending Wakanda.They spent way too much time on Riri Williams. She wasn't really necessary to the plot, and her character didn't add much to the scenes she was in. The movie is over 2 and a half hours long and if they had trimmed her scenes the movie would have been a little tighter and flowed better.The CGI was erratic. It was good in some scenes and shabby in others. Come on Disney, spend the money.That's another thing. The movie was too long with too many scenes that slowed things down without contributing anything. This watered down the movie's emotional impact.Some of the Wakandan burial rituals were odd. They just didn't seem to fit into what we know about Wakandan culture so far. It was kind of jarring actually.Finally, this was really Shuri's story. The movie should have focused more on that and less on the global implications of a second vibranium supply.On the other hand, some of the CGI was pretty good, and I didn't hate the Namor stuff as much as I thought I would. And when Shuri took the synthetic heart shaped herb in order to become the BP, I was surprised at which ancestor she ended up speaking too. At first I didn't like it but after thinking about it, it did make sense.The development of Shuri as a character was probably the best part of the movie and I wish we could have gone deeper into that. But the parts we got, especially that ending, were well worth sitting through the half-hearted fight scenes.On a little bit of an offbeat note, now I can't stop daydreaming about meeting Namora on the beach somewhere and showing her that the surface world isn't all THAT bad."
7," Parts of it sing, others fail to impress
",salramirezjr,/user/ur127571739/,12 November 2022,"Overall, a very fun watch. The impact on Wakanda revealing itself to the world has is powerful. Every single performer gives in to the darkness of the film's situation, and there is masterful direction throughout. Namor is incredible. As the story unfolds from his perspective, the time spent on Talokan itself isn't enough for to connect with, especially not when time is spent on other characters I had very little interest in (Ironheart I'm looking at you). As usual in an MCU film, the third act devolves into a CGI fest, with a smaller scale than one might hope when the most powerful nations on Earth are coming head to head."

The action was so amazing and kept you gripped to your seat. The mothers death was a major shock that I didn't anticipate I'm not sure whether it should've happened but it made the movie progress.

It is both sad and beautiful seeing a family deal with such a loss and how a nation faces loosing a king! This expands upon the MCU and Wakandas abilities. This is by far the best phase 5 film of them all! It will rate one of the highest for marvel in this phase while making an impactful statement on the nations around the world. The visuals while patchy in some areas are more than made up for it later on with stunning settings and beautiful visuals of Wakanda and other places. I very much look forward to what they do next and how they bring it forward.

",mixedsoul,/user/ur4459306/,11 November 2022,This film was much more than I could have hoped for in light of Chadwick Bozeman's passing. The feeling of grief is present throughout and it's a clear the cast worked truly hard on their character representations thru the filmThe story was a little jumbled at times in relation to Namor and his people however the origin story was actually better than I could have hoped.The main point I took away from this continuation was that there does not have to be one set way to see these stories told. Ryan Coogler proved again that he has what it takes to tell compelling stories in the face of wild expectation.
9," Wow!! Incredible film
",cparousis-30615,/user/ur113772605/,11 November 2022,"Just incredible!! The film is 2+ hours but feels like it's a 55 minute film. Acting: B+/A-. The Queen hams it up a bit too much but the rest of the cast was great. Action: A+. Lots of action. It felt more like a Marvel film than the original. Story: B+/A-. It was kinda Aquaman-ish/Avatar-ish, but it was well told and well done. Not too much, over the top Chadwick fawning. But just enough. And it was welcomed and appropriate. And done with love. It has replay value. A+ in this department. You can watch this movie over and over again and your enjoyment will be the same as the first viewing. I'm counting the days until it hits Disney+. Great job!!"
8," Imperious Rex
",stevendbeard,/user/ur2929860/,11 November 2022,"I saw Black Panther:Wakanda Forever, starring Letitia Wright-Death on the Nile_2022, Ready Player One; Lupita Nyong'o-The 355, Us; Danai Gurira-The Walking Dead_tv, My Soul to Take; Dominique Thorne-Judas and the Black Messiah, If Beale Street Could Talk and Tenoch Huerta-The Forever Purge, The 33.This is a nice tribute to Chadwick Boseman-the former Black Panther/actor who passed away-as well as being an action filled super hero movie that is a sequel to the 2018 blockbuster. It starts with the opening Marvel logo filled with nothing but pictures of Chadwick as the Black Panther in complete silence-scenes with him are shown later in the movie. The funeral is next and then it jumps a year later where everyone is coping with his death. Letitia/Shuri is taking it hardest because she couldn't save her brother. Lupita/Nakia has moved to Haiti and didn't attend the funeral-you learn why later. Danai/Okoye is still general of the security squad. Dominique/Riri is a young Tony Stark; she is a whiz with tech-even building her own suit of armor-and she also builds a machine that can detect vibranium. Tenoch/Namor shows up and wants to kill Riri, as well as all other surface dwellers, to protect his underwater kingdom of Talocan-they didn't want to use the name Atlantis because of DC's Aquaman-which is an Aztec looking civilization. Yes, Attuma and Namora pop up, Imperious Rex! Tenoch offers Wakanda a choice to either be his ally against the surface world or be his enemy and you can guess what they decide. Lots of fantastic looking fights and there is another funeral. There is a scene just as the end credits start but nothing at the very end, except The Black Panther Will Return.It's rated PG-13 for violence, action and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 41 minutes.I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu_Ray."
9," Very emotion film.
",Finnley_s,/user/ur156746528/,11 November 2022,"This is one of faze fours best movies.Everyones acting In this film was perfect, the whole movie keeps an emotional tone throughout the entirety of it, and it was genuinely sad, I have never seen actors convey emotion as well as this cast did,
especially Letitia Wright, when she cried it was hard to watch.Chadwick Boseman, was such an incredible and beautiful person and this film honers his legacy and continues it respectfully, they did it in a way that really did work.In my personal opinion black panther will never be the same without Chadwick, that is not diminishing this movie in anyway Chadwick in my opinion, just cannot be matched.What I love about this film is that marvel really pushed the boundaries with violence a bit more whilst still keeping a good age rating.The ending of this film was a triumph for marvel it was quite a sad but incredible ending and very different from what fans are used to with marvel and personally I loved it.I would one hundred percent watch this movie when you get the opportunity I loved this movie and everything it stood for.Rest in peace our king Chadwick Boseman."
8," MARVEL Is Back!
",SHU_Movies,/user/ur86310970/,11 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is one of the slowest paced MCU movies to date. But, that said, it's worth it. As a movie, it had so many jobs to do, and I think it did all of them really well. The story is good, the writing is good, the cinematography is gorgeous, the VFX are mixed but mostly pretty decent, the acting is incredible all across the board, the soundtrack (both the score and actual music) is brilliant, and on the whole, it's one of my favourite things we've gotten out of Phase 4.There's honestly not a whole lot that I feel I can talk about regarding the film without saying anything that could potentially spoil something for anyone, so I'm going to keep this one short...To summarise, though, it's a solid MARVEL movie that brings me back to when MCU movies were frequently of high quality. It's been about a year since I last left the cinema having watched a MARVEL movie where I had this happy feeling inside. It's almost a nostalgic feeling... And it's good to have it backRest in power, King."
7," Unsurprisingly not as good without Chadwick.
",danjackson-29089,/user/ur153975775/,11 November 2022,"Well it was a long wait and I can't say I was overly surprised it didn't live up to the anticipation....the biggest aspect that stood out for me was how much it just seemed to drag on, my eyes were wandering around the cinema, checking my watch a few times while the film ticked its ""true to the African history"" boxes which yeah I get is important but always seemed like you wlare waiting for something to happen. The action takes a while and then it only comes in dribs and drabs albeit the CGI is fantastic and the cast again even without Chadwick are perfectly casted. Felt the enemy was a little ""meh"" and there was no real villain involved so the payoff was never there either in victory! Overall it was OK, decent, worth watching... but again what seems to be the trend with recent MCU movies is the CGI making up for the super basic scripts. I don't hold much hope for the new Avengers line up at all..... hope I'm wrong."
8," Has a title card ever bought on tears before?
",olliemarch-72638,/user/ur157494326/,11 November 2022,"A touching tribute of a film to the late Chadwick Boseman. The film handled his death in a respectful way and the mantle has been passed on in a way that makes sense to the story.The music was superb and as expected judging from the trailer. The visuals were much better than the original film, not just one big CGI mess.But...in the places this film was one of the more boring MCU films I've seen in a while. It has a large run time and alot of it feels like it could have been cut which was a shame as it did have a really engaging story with the antagonist having some fair opinions.This film in my opinion does hold the prize for the most goofy costume we've ever seen in an MCU film (though it may be comic book accurate, or just took me out a little bit).Though the post credit scene did end the film on a really beautiful note.RIP King, Wakanda forever."
7," A good and worthy sequel!
",ItsRobinTV,/user/ur154814932/,11 November 2022,"I have to say I didn't know what I should expect from this movie, especially in this era of the MCU where the film quality varies a lot, but thank god it was a good movie...It has some great acting and some really really wonderful, epic and cinematic shots and also some really great music. You can really feel some scenes like you're in them. The cinematography was also really good but of course the movie has it's weaknesses...For example some characters seam unnecessary, don't do much to the plot and are not so good written and every scene with them just doesn't feels right, but at the end it's a good movie.So if you're a fan of the first movie you will probably love this movie so go watch this movie but even if you're not a fan of the first movie you should probably also go watch this movie because you will still find it good.For me it's a 7/10 but really really close to the 8/10."
10," Spectacular IMAX 3D experience I even cried a little
",UniqueParticle,/user/ur34836174/,11 November 2022,"Just as great as original, plenty of emotions worthy of nominations and perfect amount of humor as usual for Marvel films! Kinda difficult to see everything in 3D but sill worth it. All the characters were great throughout especially Shuri and M'Baku. The action was very satisfying, cinematography/ amazing atmosphere was glorious throughout, acting was phenomenal; Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is one of the best Marvel movies out there! A perfect honoring of Chadwick Boseman in every aspect, I'm sure his family are happy with what Ryan Coogler has done. I loved this quite a bit I hope others do too."

9," Powerful Spirit!
",BerinNilsu,/user/ur108475215/,11 November 2022,"The movie has such a powerful spirit and I felt in every minute of it. Got emotional and couldn't stop myself to mourn too. It was beautiful to keep Chadwick Boseman's memory alive.Shuri's development was amazingly done. But she's been thought A LOT!!I was just so sorry for her.. :(Namor's story was brilliant and i loved every scene of him. Powerful character and powerful personality.Talokan scenes were fascinating. Watching Namor to giving Shuri a tour of his home just made me feel different things and I loved it!!! Also giving his mother's bracelet to her, Cmon he has a pure heart even if he wants to kill Riri just for his homeland's safety. IDC i loved him already. He is a good leader...Can't wait to see Tenoch Huerta's Namor comeback story and watching him all along.A.k.a THE FIRST MUTANT!!After credit scene wasn't a shock to me. I have seen that coming. Junior T'Challa :)"
10," The 2nd Black Panther is the best superhero movie ever made
",Rocky2220,/user/ur85644621/,11 November 2022,"This movie takes the Black Panther franchise to new heights! Angela Bassett, Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira, Tenoch Huerta, and Winston Dukes give A-list performances that bring the movie script to life. Ryan Coogler's directorial and writing skills are second to none. Namor is a complex character whose motivations make real-world sense. This movie will make you laugh, cry and shout for joy. The action scenes were intense and well done. The movie's running time is no problem because you are constantly entertained. Marvel movies have become stale, however Black Panther stands out because of the real-life issues that it addresses. The Black Panther was so good I am going to see it again."
8," Emotional, Mature Film With A Lot To Say
",JayDeeezy,/user/ur134485651/,11 November 2022,"This film was special. We knew it was going to be emotional, but it ended up having a lot more to say than I anticipated. Themes of loss, grief, legacy, are also intertwined with a story our world's history of invasion and war over the balance of power and resources. It was definitely a long film for a reason but there was a purpose to every scene. Overall this ended up being one of (if not the) heaviest and most emotional films of the MCU.Starting with the cinematography - this film was absolutely beautiful. Wakanda is as vibrant as ever and Talokan was an awesome addition as a setting. The costume design, environments, colors, character designs of the Talokan's were just stunning and some of the battle sequences were amazing to look at.The plot was very good. Expectedly, I was crying 60 seconds into the film. A tragedy sends all of our characters into mourning but the relentless looming threats forces them to hold their heads up and choose their future. Shuri is ironically and poetically thrust into a very similar heroes journey focused on revenge that her brother originally walked during Civil War. In the meantime, Namor and his people are portrayed as a sympathetic people - victims of prior invasion. The common ground they share with Wakanda is very intentional and very interesting as a plot point. Even with different cultures and ideologies, the similarities between human beings are ever present and we are all vulnerable to conflict, hatred, and greed.The performances were incredibly strong - likely because the actors were in a sense living a similar story, which is awful, but it shows and they make you feel it. Angela Bassett is just stunning and powerful as Queen Mother. Leticia Wright just makes you feel every second of her grief. And Danai Gurira absolutely shines here - I've never felt so much for Okoye. Dominique Thorne was awesome as Riri and I'm very excited to see more of Ironheart.All in all, this was a special and beautiful film. It does get a bit long and serious in the middle for a superhero movie so people may find that hard to sit with, especially upon rewatch. But I think Ryan Coogler used that time to tell an important, heart wrenching story filled with grief but also hope and shined a light of respect and legacy upon the crew's late friend, Chadwick Boseman."
7," The kind of movie you watch, think ""yeah that was good"" and then never watch again
",matthewscrugham,/user/ur134307679/,11 November 2022,"This movie was worth my time. It was entertaining, had good acting, and a decent villain. The only problem was that there was nothing special about it. We've seen the same plot done better in half a dozen other Marvel movies.Also, while the cast puts up great performances, this movie simply can't live up to the first one with the absence of Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan. Don't expect this movie to surpass the first one.This movie is more slow and drawn out than most marvel movies, having a very long runtime and not as much action as a typical Marvel movie. That gives it more time for character development but it's less exciting. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing is up for debate.Overall, it's a good movie but nothing more."
8," Well.....that was unexpected.....
",samuelmills-81017,/user/ur135468281/,11 November 2022,I somehow enjoyed it more than I expected the villans against the hero's was insane I would give it a 8.9 I love the fights but the 2 hour and 43 mins is to long It kinda got boring at the 2 hour mark and it's quite dark for a 12 it will scare alot of kids the water side with people walking off edges and getting stabbed to death off screen and namor threating the hero's he will bury there queen and kill everyone in there is very dark for kids to hear and seeing his past should be a 15+ just for that so I would recommend kids over 14+ would handle it kids under 10 won't and shuri being stabbed was graphic for the age rating so this was my rating and opinion hope everyone likes the film.
7," There's A Lot to Like, and A Lot to Dislike
",PyroSikTh,/user/ur5261700/,11 November 2022,"Just like with the first movie, there's a lot about Wakanda Forever that I really, really liked. There's some amazing worldbuilding and powerhouse performances here, the story is enthralling, and the antagonist is about as perfect as you can get in the way he was developed and the role he served. The score by Ludwig Goransson was once again on-point, the realisation of Talokan was fantastic, and every reverence to Chadwick Boseman was respectful and heartbreaking in equal measure. This is a movie that really cared about the legacy of its late star, and was aware of the love and admiration he had earned. But unfortunately, also like the first movie, there was a bunch about Wakanda Forever that I wasn't as much of a fun of. It was too long, filled with too much faff, it was so badly lit certain scenes were almost unwatchable, and they put their bets on the wrong leading actor going ahead. And yet I'm eager to see the effect this movie has on the wider MCU going forward. It did lay the groundwork for a lot of upcoming projects, even if it was to the film's overall detriment. And if you ignore all of that the core elements of the film are essential viewing for any Marvel fan. Wakanda Forever somehow managed to simultaneously be one of the MCU's highest peaks, as well as one of its lowest ditches. And for that I fall on an entertaining 7/10 that remains an improvement on the first film. Huerta and Bassett may be enough on their own to earn an 8 though. I guess time and rewatches may tell.QyrosMovies."
9," Tender, human, tragic and Beautiful
",harry-34518,/user/ur104275634/,11 November 2022,"The biggest compliment I can give this film is just how human it feels, you can feel the grief and sadness pouring through every shot. But perhaps the best part of this movie is the grief isn't used to make it good the story is compelling, Namor is a great villain and Shuris arc in the course of this movie was amazing and some of marvels best character arc. Seeing wakanda vs Tolkan (sorry if misspelled) was thrilling and both sides had really good points and arguments. The performances across the board were perfect and riri made a great addition to the movie. I do have some issues with the movie however the action at points can be a bit generic and in the third act there's a montage used to try and get the characters ready for the final battle and feels a bit lazy. But aside from that this has to be one of the better marvel movies and worthy successor to the original black panther."
10," WOW, SPEECHLESS!! Please don't compare with part 1.
",chitreshgupta,/user/ur23623188/,11 November 2022,"Just wow & speechless, this movie has everything. Proper blend of emotions, empathy, loss & grieving. Performance of everyone is remarkably good. Story arc of Namor, Shuri & Riri Williams ks just perfect. They actually work on the character development. Proper tribute to Sir Chadwick Boseman. You can feel his presence though-out the movie. Action & vfx are also very good and its perfectly blends in. Ryan Coogler did the fantastic job. We can't compare with the part 1, that was about the legacy of T'Challa & part 2 is tribute to him. Hats off to Ryan to pull this off.This was entirely a 10/10 movie for me. No regrets at all watching it. Just go watch it, you won't be disappointed."
8," One of the best MCU movies
",Jithindurden,/user/ur46647047/,11 November 2022,"The first Black Panther was very different for a Marvel movie. It felt fresh and was one of the best solo movies of MCU. But even with everything great in it, there were some aspects of it that were designed clearly to be on the safe side of the primary target audience of the MCU. With Wakanda Forever, they surpassed the first part in my opinion and became one of the best movies in MCU. Still, by the end of it, even this doesn't stray too far from a point which is not just for the target audience but also probably for the production company itself.Wakanda Forever is excellent in all aspects of it portraying the imperialistic nature of not just the past but the present superpowers and how that primarily drives the violence ensuing in places where they don't even have to approach directly. At the same time, the film is a fitting tribute to Chadwick Boseman and his character. There were a few pleasant surprises in there too which I was very glad to see. By the beginning of the third act, I was convinced this is probably THE best MCU film depending on how they chose to end it. But even though the third act wasn't bad per se, it showed how the makers are still in the trappings of the studio system where the blame is passed around through individual failings and an invisible system rather than the enablers and the idealogues of the system. This is still one of the best MCU films and I love how the MCUness relatively limited in this film."
9," The music makes so much more sense in context
",yourfriendmissminutes,/user/ur66405227/,11 November 2022,"Wonderful stories with a fullness of dignity and respect for the cultures represented. Talokan is beautiful. Wakanda city and its people are impressive as always. Not a cheap film with tropes. Explores the depths of a mother's love for her child (and her willingness to protect innocents) as well as a ruler's responsibility for her people. Shuri's arc of mourning was well-crafted. The silent tribute to Chadwick in the end echoed the silent Marvel intro tribute. Overall, you can tell a lot of care and attention to detail was pured into this film. Great film, dare I say it's one of the best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
6," They shouldn't have made another movie
",stephanie_wal-04572,/user/ur96808133/,11 November 2022,"Where to start at this rushed and thrown together movie? The tribute to Chadwick was heartbreaking. I teared up a few times but the tribute was overkill! From the beginning, middle, and end the writers wanted us to stay focused on Chadwick. The mentions of the characters Iron Man and the Hulk was unwarranted and unnecessary especially since they weren't their to help. I was very ANNOYED with that the student scientist who was in the knock off Iron Man suit because it took Tony Stark more than a few times to get the hang of his suit and it only took her 5 minutes or less!?!?? Really? How come Aquaman and the Atlantians didn't know anything about these people who lived among them?? The storyline seemed rushed and it didn't make sense. They should've never made this movie."
8," Respectful Homage
",jace_the_film_guy,/user/ur79005849/,11 November 2022,"Within 30 seconds of the film starting, tears were flowing. Losing a powerful and beloved character in T'Challa is gut-wrenching. ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is a tribute to him and the filmmakers approach his death with reverence and respect. In T'Challa's absence, the rest of the characters step up to the plate. His younger sister, Shuri, grapples with grief, doubt, and disbelief in a profound way. His mother, Ramonda, wears her heart on her sleeve and the acting performance by Angela Bassett is one of the best in the MCU.Not only are the returning characters excellent, but the new personalities are equally captivating. The film's antagonist, Namor, is a top-tier foe and he brings the story to a deeper level. His conversations, especially with Shuri, are some of the best moments in the film. Their scenes together are dialogue heavy, but everything said is necessary and thoughtful.Though the music is superb, this film is not afraid of silence. There are multiple, near-silent moments that allow the audience to absorb the story. This technique is not used often in modern filmmaking, and I absolutely loved it.Ryan Coogler, the writer/director of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"", had a tall task ahead of him when Boseman passed. With the saga's protector gone, where would the narrative go? This lack of surety is felt throughout the movie. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; it just makes for an uneasy and emotional 2 Â½ hour journey.There are a few scenes that took place in the United States that drag a bit and did not have much impact on the plot. I found myself less invested whenever the story left Wakanda or Talokan (Namor's home). The scenes involving the CIA and other American characters did not fit the overall narrative and were only there to set up future MCU projects. This movie does not reach the same level as its predecessor, but they did an admirable job.When the credits rolled (after a stunning mid-credit scene) I wanted to ask the projectionist to run it back again. This is only the second movie this year (the first being ""Top Gun: Maverick"") that I wanted to re-watch immediately following my viewing.Unlike other films in Phase 4 of the MCU, this movie did not rely on jokes or over-the-top action sequences. Instead, ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" paid respectful homage to one of the most beloved characters in modern cinema. Without a doubt, there is a hole left where T'Challa used to be, however, Coogler and his team handled his absence with class.Best Character: Namor
Best Scene: Visiting Talokan
Best Quote: ""Have I not given everything?"" - Ramonda
Best Piece of Score: ""T'Challa"""
5," The confidence rate is quite middling for this one.
",chand-suhas,/user/ur23656818/,11 November 2022,"What Wakanda Forever gets right is the way it pays tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman. The way the writers go about tackling this loss is indeed commendable & the actors too in those scenes make it quite memorable as the lines feels connected to the actor than the character he played. Post the demise of their King, the Wakanda is in the mourning state but they are aware of the dangers ahead with respect to greedy nations planning to get their hands on the Vibranium. As they struggle to come into terms with the loss as well as protecting their country, they are unaware of the magnitude of the danger that lies ahead. Enter Namor (for his enemies), King of Talokan. He is someone Wakanda is just not ready to face.Unlike the first movie, the cultural aspects are limited in this one. I for one wanted more intro to Talokan & it's people, culturally to connect with them. Anyways the writers opted for the easy route with a flashback to establish Namor's character. There was too much to unburden when it came to the key Wakandan characters balancing between handling the loss of their King & expanding the story.Once the reveal of the antagonist happens, the story moved unconvincingly. It tried to play to the gallery while attempting to portray a serious plot. Somehow, it didn't deliver on both ends. The action at best was average especially that prolonged sea battle sequence with few underwhelming vfx shots. Wakanda Forever definitely started strongly with that first act effectively showcasing how Ramonda & Shuri are handling their grief. As tame the introduction of Riri was, the following action scene worked well. But thereafter, the movie lost it's direction.With the charm of the first part missing, Wakanda Forever doesn't really hit the same high as it's predecessor. Through mourning for T'challa, the actors get to mourn for the actor and so do we. When it is not resorting to pointless exposition, it definitely had it's moments and indeed there was a better Black Panther movie which got subdued due to the immense pressure of handling the unavoidable circumstances and the need to match the blockbuster expectations."
9," A worthy sequel and tribute
",ta-98251,/user/ur147286305/,11 November 2022,"So Ryan Coogler had already finished writing the Black Panther 2 script before Boseman passed after which he had to rewrite the film without Boseman and T'Challa as the lead in the wildest of circumstances.Safe to say he did as good a job as possible...Not only with coming up with a new script but with having the film fully incorporate the death of T'Challa into the plot by exploring death, loss, grief and both the emotional and political fall out from death.The film throws you straight into the emotional journey with the opening scene even before the Marvel Film Studio logo comes on screen.From there on out it's a enjoyable drama filled, action packed journey lasting 2 hours and 40 mins. I didn't feel the time to be honest.The performances in this were also very strong. Angela Basset, Danai Gurira, Lupita Nyong'o and Letita Wright all had to give emotional heavy performances that had you wondering whether they were acting or just being real... Whilst there was limited comedy (rightly so) it was funny and memorable whenever it came :).I really enjoyed the villains too. The civilisation were interesting (albeit a bit Avatar - The Way of the Water like - That isn't being released until next month) and their leader (Namor) is a strong impressive presence in the film.The music was fire - Both the soundtrack with Tems, Rihanna, Stormzy, Burna Boy etc and the original score by Ludwig Gorannson who is one of my favourite composers. The CGI was on point too. It has generally been hit and miss during phase 4 but there were only a couple of moment i questioned which is very impressive given the nature of the villain's powers.A worthy follow up to the original Black Panther and a fitting tribute to Chadwick Boseman throughout.P.s The man next to me definitely in tears by the end of the film ðŸ˜¢"
9," FINALLY
",siteoner,/user/ur7644351/,11 November 2022,"They did it! They finally did it!For the first time since Endgame, Feige and company have released a movie that's actually GOOD! I was starting to lose faith in the MCU as a film property (the shows are mostly great, and I still think comic characters and their stories work better as episodic TV than movies, but I digress), but I now have renewed faith. This flick had to pull double duty as a functional narrative and a tribute to its previous star and actually, somehow, succeeds at both.Though I'm starting to question if it's gonna be a theme of the Black Panther movies that the ""villain"" is right about the world."
6," I Yield
",dannylee-78082,/user/ur62070774/,11 November 2022,"First of all, RIP to Chadwick Boseman. They really did do a good tribute to him in this movie through various devices. Performances when reflecting his death felt real and convincing, probably because there was little ""acting"" involved. Losing a franchise star is really a tough blow. While I felt Boseman's absence, I don't think not all of the movie's downfalls are linked to his absence.Biggest head-scratching moments were for me was poor writing mainly from some of the tactical choices. The whole conflict stems from the existence of Riri (soon to be Ironheart), who built a Vibranium detector for a school project. Apparently, she's the only one in the world who can do that. Aside from that ridiculous premise, I thought Ironheart's introduction to the MCU was not bad (I still think the suit is ugly). She was likable enough and I think she has potential. I do worry about the overlap between her and Shuri because while they do have good chemistry, they are such similar characters. Anyways, this detector triggers a cascade of events where Shuri and Riri are taken to Talokan. First of all, getting rid of Riri will not do anything because the technology is no longer in her hands alone. Also, Wakandans have very little reason to protect her other than the fact she's a great scientist. I was also baffled that key hostages like Shuri and Riri could escape Taloka with the help of one person DURING an ongoing negotiation. A rookie foreign affairs mistake. It was not even a hostage situation. It was closer to an aggressive invitation. This was literally the cause of the all-out war and I thought it was just poorly written how they started that conflict. And at that point, the entire war felt so meaningless and stakeless because it wasn't clear why they were fighting. It still isn't clear why Talokans wanted to go to war with Wakanda. So whatever came after that became difficult to love. Ramonda's death was also quite preventable in my opinion. The queen with no protection and left to drown. Like why does Riri matter so much to Ramonda that she sacrificed herself to save her? It almost felt like an artificial plot device to pump up Ironheart's value as a a character. And Shuri does not blame Riri once or show any animosity toward her even though she was an indirect cause of her mother's death? Seemed a little strange unless she didn't know what happened.There were positive things too. I thought Taloka's story was interesting and was well introduced. Loved Namor as a character and his action scenes were powerful enough. The performances were solid across the board, especially Ramonda and Namor shined. I thought some of the battle sequences were interesting despite being imperfect (really bad CG moments here and there). Overall, it was rather inconsistent with really cool spear fighting scenes and just generic scenes. The whales really did surprise me. I thought the locations were well chosen. I really like their portrayal of Wakanda and Taloka in general so that's a plus. I enjoyed how they incorporated the idea of the oppressed (the Mayans) versus oppressor like they did in Black Panther 1. But again, this should only unite Taloka and Wakanda together rather than fight against each other.I'd also like to comment on Shuri. She has now become the official franchise star with the death of Ramonda and T'challa. My overall impression that while she has the potential to be the franchise but it's a tough transition. She's been known as the geek scientist sister but now she's the black panther and the sole protector of Wakanda. That's a big jump for both the audience and the character. That type of transition, fueled mostly by grief and revenge, should usually take multiple movies or a series to hash out but that was not an option for the production team. So while I still am not used to the transition, I think they were handled as well as they could be. Her characterization was complex and meaningful enough. A far better experience than the most recent MCU movie.In the end, phase 4 has been a let-down for most fans with a notable exception. I was disappointed that this movie was not able to be part of that exception."
8," Mostly great but with some poor elements thrown in
",tremault-08547,/user/ur135262659/,11 November 2022,"I really enjoyed Shuri's story, the film was incredibly emotional and powerful and had me in tears a few times. Most of the scenes were incredibly done and blew me away but the finale was a bit of a jumble with too many elements going on at once. I feel the finale could actually have been much easier to follow if it weren't for the one character who seems to not really belong in this movie. Yes, Riri. Now, I don't mind her as a mcguffin in theory, but her character is so poorly presented, undeveloped and almost a mary-sue. She's just amazing and that's it. She can invent anything and make an amazing power suit without breaking a sweat and there seem to be no missteps or character development. She wants a suit, she makes a suit. She wants a vibranium detector, she makes a vibranium detector. She doesn't work as a character in her own rite, she is just there to be the thing that the characters are fighting over. I would be wiling to accept if that is all she was, but they are trying to make her more than that and she just sticks out like a sore thumb."
5," While most of the cast is fine, it's another Phase 4 lost cause.
",mhorg2018,/user/ur22761455/,11 November 2022,"This is an unworthy sequel to the original. While most of the cast is fine-I'll get to Namor later, the story drags way too much. Shuri is the star of this one, and Riri is a welcome addition to the MCU, but the story... whoever decided to make Atlanteans and Namor descended from Mesoamericans, did a poor job. Namor's mother wasn't human. As for the fear of using Atlantis, why? So what if DC used it as well? Why hasn't Marvel comics stopped losing it? And the actor playing Namor wasn't that convincing. He should have hit the gym a little more, and lost that goatee. The only time Namor had a beard was in the excellent Maestro series. They needed to put more thought into the origins of he and his people. Also was anyone surprised that the wristband fibers would enable Shuri to become the new Black Panther? I wasn't since it was telegraphed a mile away. I'm glad that Nakia and Winston Duke's characters survived. I was disappointed that there was no mid-credits scene, but perhaps there wasn't a reason yet. All in all, like all of phase 4, this was disappointing. It needed far better pacing. I will say Julia-Louis Drefuss plays a great villainous role. Kine of like Elaine Benes on crack. So, if I never see this again-like all of phase 4, I won't care. Marvel for all the money it makes thanks to the drones who think everything they do is great, has hit a bump in the road. Maybe they'll start falling on their faces. Who knows?"
9," 9.5/10
",vessalalizadeh,/user/ur118772758/,11 November 2022,"The best MCU movie since Spider-Man No Way Home. This film has emotion, heart, and epicness. Around T'Challa's death, the characters are showing their emotions excellently well. This movie will be in my top films of the year. This, just like the first film, shows absolutely respect to the black people of the world. The movie shows a culture that black people have and it does it in a extraordinary way. THIS is how you make a film for people that have different diverse personalities and respect them.This film is great, it IS great. It has super action. It has a great script. Peak character development, awesome soundtrack, amazing climax and a relatable ending. This is all for the legendary actor who played T'Challa, Black Panther."
10," Feels Like the Olden Days of the MCU
",sajidifti,/user/ur122590906/,11 November 2022,"Bring tissue paper.Not perfect but man it feels like the old MCU. It was a cinematic experience. Emotional and uplifting.The whole movie is a tribute to Chadwick Boseman. It is really not the time to recast Black Panther. They made the best out of the situation and the story. The story does not have many surprises. Even though the story is predictable and general knowledge for some, it feels like a labor of love. Ryan Coogler made this movie with care, empathy and patience. I liked the character developments in the movie. Nowadays, I don't expect that much depth in an MCU movie but Black Panther: Wakanda Forever did not disappoint me.The CGI/VFX was bland in some places. Overall, it was very good. The ending and the mid-credit scene left options for future. They can shape the next movie however they see fit."
5," So disappointed
",philgillen,/user/ur70459124/,11 November 2022,"I don't go into MCU movies with any huge expectations, if anything I'm quite able to suspend my disbelief and enjoy wach movie on its own merits - but I have to say I'm so disappointed with this. The pacing is all over the place, the character beats are not earned at all, and the story is tepid at best, This could have been coherent and a solid 7/10 movie had there been some more ruthless editing - but unfortunately it makes little to no sense as it is.I really don't mean to impede anyone's enjoyment of it, but this feels like such a missed opportunity to tell an interesting, if not particularly groundbreaking, story.The most surprising thing is that Boseman's death isn't even at the root of the problem with the storytelling. It's simply poorly executed.Although this doesn't usually reduce my enjoyment of films, it's worth noting as well that the cgi was verging on terrible. Marvel, please rethink your post production because this is needlessly detracting from the story."
9," A Fantastic, Emotional, and Mature Marvel Film
",kjproulx,/user/ur23240045/,11 November 2022,"Black Panther was a very welcome addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe back in 2018 and I was really looking forward to seeing the progression of that character. Obviously, with the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman, that just wasn't possible anymore. I figured they would recast the character and continue forward, but they made the tough decision to write the death of the character into the film as well. For that reason, I was worried and relieved all at the same time. It seemed like an impossible task to make a sequel to such a beloved film, but not have the core character there the entire time. Well, after seeing Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, I can confidently say that they handled it as well as they possibly could have. I thought this film was emotional and fantastic, and here's why.Picking up six years after the events of Black Panther (in accordance to the events of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame), this film focuses heavily on the loss of T'Challa and how the country can move forward without their leader. With the emergence of Namor and the underwater city of Talokan threatening all of Wakanda, the remaining characters must band together and protect their country. Shuri (Letitia Wright) is easily the one with the most screentime here and the burden of carrying this franchise is on her shoulders the whole time. This must have been a daunting task, but she pulled it off. Her character, along with her mother, portrayed incredibly well once again by Angela Basset, are the beating hearts of this film. The emotional aspect of this film got me on a few occasions.Some people may complain about the fact that the death of Chadwick Boseman is basically the jumping-off point for this story to even happen, but I found that it was very tastefully done. With the addition of other characters that will have a future in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this film was filled to the brim with story. Where I might have my only complaint though, is the fact that this feels like a big budget prelude to what will come next. It's a fantastically made film by director Ryan Coogler and I loved watching every minute of this one, but I have to admit that it did feel like more of a long eulogy for the passing of Boseman.With all of that said though, I'm only complaining about that because I'm reviewing it and criticizing it. That complaint isn't something I will regularly say about this film. They take the time to make a great film on top of that, so it really worked for me overall. I can't wait to see where certain storylines continue later and the fact that I'm excited about that, all while this film is satisfying on its own, is nothing short of great. I wept, I was entertained, and I was engaged in the story at hand, so what else could I really have asked for from this film? Also, the final scene that takes place during the credits is easily one of my favourite post-credit scenes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was very well handled. Now playing in theatres, I absolutely recommend checking out Black Panther: Wakanda Forever."
5," Not bad, but not awesome
",CKaz74,/user/ur138954010/,11 November 2022,"Great tribute to Chadwick. Angela is great and beautiful. Shuri is good. Ironheart is rendered like a 90s CGI power ranger and just a miss although the actress is definitely talented.The CGI physics and renders are not on par. It's like this was a early 2000 CGI movie. Dark in the beginning and then I guess Wakanda is now a theme park by the ocean 1/2 way through with some Avatar invaders?Namor is not Namor....and anyone that reads comics would know this. Victoria Alonso's explanation of his name is b.s. ...this is a rights ownership issue. A huge dud...sorry folks. Just cringe acting and writing.... maybe get an actor that doesn't have dad bod to play a super hero?Also, where are the male role models? Michael B. Jordan was overlooked.Long movie that left me really missing the magic that has been lost in Marvel."
6," Overblown and Oversaturated Airplane Movie
",Revuer223,/user/ur76469186/,11 November 2022,"At this point, Marvel is getting too saturated for its own good. The movie's beginning and the end is good, but the middle is too slow and crammed with corporate-mandated plot requirements, so much so that the writers didn't know what to do.I really feel that this is the product of unrealistic corporate deadlines, leading to incohesive and plot-hole ridden story, subpar CGI, and morally problematic characters that we are supposed to think are heroes. I don't think Marvel is really taking the time to quality check.To start, the villain is not really likeable or unlikeable. The villain just sort of exists. At least the first Black Panther movie had a villain that was likeable, carried by the performance of Michael B. Jordan. Another point of weakness is how Ironheart was crammed into the plot as required by Disney. As they tried to cram her in, plot points began to crack (which will not be mentioned here due to spoilers). The story is not cohesive. The third, and perhaps the biggest, point of weakness is the action scenes.Action scenes, you would think, would be the centerpieces of superhero movies, right? But Marvel's sweat-shop CGI studios seem to lack the motivation or at least the time to render quality products, not to mention how the choreography is sub-par as well. At the end, Black Panther 2's action scenes are forgettable.It is mildly entertaining enough to be an airplane or a steam-at-home movie, but this is by no means a great movie."
10," A beautiful masterpiece
",zainshenwari,/user/ur64729831/,11 November 2022,"I don't know how to put in words how impressed I was by this movie. First of all, i had 2 concerns before even watching the movie. One I was really annoyed about them not replacing Chadwick Boseman, because I felt that the Black Panther character story should still be told and then secondly I was concerned about the underwater scene in marvels Aquaman version would feel like a rip off.. but after watching this movie, oh my God!, what a beautiful craftsmanship of symbolism and beautiful storytelling bringing cultures together, literally and figuratively. After watching the underwater scenes with Namor, I forgot that Aquaman even ever existed. And as far as Chadwick Boseman's is concerned, I think what they did was the most beautiful way of honoring him and you just have to see it with an open mind because I think what they did was amazing. I'm actually quite surprised why this movie has a 7.4 whatever, this movie was absolutely amazing!"
3," Too lengthy with less action sequences
",nakap,/user/ur73569135/,11 November 2022,"Three star for effort, cast and Chadwick Boseman .. baaki sab thik hi hai. But Namor got beaten by a Female Black Panther didn't go well by me. He's a great big and Huge character that I admired as a kids comparing with AQUAMAN. Huge minus 4 star for that. And minus 3 star for not SO good action sequences, lazy writing and too darn long lengthy film.The only thing that was good is when the end credits were rolling out and we get to see the post credit scenes. I almost left the movie midway.. There was even a time where I dozed off for 2 seconds. Not worth watching for theatre experience. Let it come out in OTT platform and then watch it at your home."

",raja-mishra7,/user/ur22366511/,11 November 2022,"For most of us, the Black Panther will not be the same. Chadwick was a perfect fit for the Panther. Now that he is gone, they had to do something to move the story forward and the story tellers have done their jobs, the actors almost did their jobs, the director did the job well too, but the x-factor was missing.After a long time- Marvel has approached an MCU movie in a stand alone manner. This was all about Panther's Wakanda and the.world of Nemor- it didn't have much interventions from the MCU, no star cameo, no unnecessary superhero entrances.But somehow, the journey of the characters didn't feel very satisfying. May be we missed T'Challa."

",JohnDeSando,/user/ur1391596/,11 November 2022,"""This place is amazing. The air is pristine, and the water... My mother told me stories about a place like this, a protected land with people who never have to leave, who never have to change who they were. What reason do you have to reveal your secret to the world?"" Namor (Tenoch Huerta)Aztec-like Namor rules the prosperous underwater kingdom, Talokan, but is impressed by the thriving African nation, Wakanda, both nations having their secret wealth tied to a powerful ore, vibranium. As in the case of gold in other African nations, they need to protect their wealth. Yet, Wakanda has lost a wealth far greater, their deceased King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman).Writer/director Ryan Coogler (with co-writer Jake Robert Cole), nurses the melancholy of regret to make another blockbuster addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that deals with mortality seriously, not casually, as the usual case. With Namor's Latin resemblance, Wakanda Forever also gently extends the Universe.In Wakanda Forever. As he did in Black Panther, Coogler crafts a memorable mythology with sterling actors, gorgeous sets, and colorful costumes. This sequel thrives, despite the tragic loss of Boseman, because it depicts an essentially good people (think the USA) peaceful until roused to national fervor protecting their natural resources and their pride.In the background lies the African history of exploitation and colonial slavery. Wakanda could have been real if not for those barbarians. The best exemplar of the proud fictional nation is its matriarch, Ramonda (Angela Basset), who would rift a loyal general and friend for a battle screwup.The real future of Wakanda is Shuri (Letitia Wright, the late King's sister), whose braininess and boldness promise the ""Forever"" of the title. Because she is modern and openminded, she can dance the diplomacy dance nimbly, especially with the confounding complications of the underwater kingdom. Wakanda Forever's universal tough love promises we will have many more confrontations with countries and personal ambitions. Kiss the dominating explosions of your typical superhero adventure goodbye in favor of dialogue that explodes with meaning.""Only the most broken people can be great leaders."" Namor."

I had to tel my self to wait & not leave the theatre in the hope that something nice & exciting would come up, but I was obviously let down in the end.I was totally let down on the entry of the new Black Panther & apart from this every scene was so predictable & obvious.

Usually marvel movies have a crappy story, crappy writing, but this one was deep. The most recent Spider-Man was the best marvel movie, but this one was right up there with it.

10," BEST MCU FILM TO DATE
",notkingsoup,/user/ur155005830/,11 November 2022,"I went into the theater looking for every reason to not like this movie. I was ready for a subpar sequel to a film I think is ridiculously overhyped. What I did not expect was a Cinematic Masterpiece.From start to finish Wakanda Forever gives you everything you could ask for in its 2 hour & 41 minute runtime. Action scenes will have you on the edge of your seat. The Climax will have you emotional. This movie did a great job on making it feel like the viewer is apart of whatever is happening.Cinematography is 10/10. Wakanda is always beautiful on screen but additional locations especially the one hosting the antagonist stole the show for me.Letitia Wright led the way with her recurring role and made every scene count. Flawless performance from her & the supporting cast consisting of Lupita Nyong'o, Angela Bassett, Danai Gurira & more. The way they took real life issues and portrayed them in the film really made the story hit close to home although it's being held in a fantasy universe. Tenoch Huerta's role as Namor could be the #2 MCU villain so far with Thanos still claiming the #1 spot. You were able to reason with his decisions and fully understand his point of view rather than the traditional ""Over the top"" villains that just act based on their strength level.The plot was perfect. With the passing of Chadwick Boseman (RIP) This movie was able to exist with no flaws even with his absence. I could honestly say the movie may not have been as great if he were in it. And that's because he wouldn't have fit. They handled his passing in the movie in a way that set the tone & passed the torch to the rest of the cast to finish what they originally started.Overall...Best movie I've seen all year. #1 MCU movie so far. Could arguably be in the top 10 movies of all time."
8," A little too long, but a pleasant surprise
",Prisszm,/user/ur16221399/,11 November 2022,"I came into this movie with low expectations given the passing of Chadwick, and the general weakness MCU has been putting out since Endgame. I was pleasantly surprised with the output. The movie still had your touches of classic MCU cliches and humors, but they were much more tame than in recent years past. From the start, this movie begins with a very serious and emotional tone and holds onto it through the end, only giving way for a few slight comedic relief moments. I loved that this movie was able to not add a new main lead and instead relied on stronger performances of the previous cast, who delivered outstanding follow-up products.Namor was one of the better villains the MCU has put out, as Namor's depiction was somewhat similar to Thanos - someone with a passion to fulfill their mission, with some questionable character reasoning that adds to the plot dilemma. Credit to the effort Tenoch Huerta put in for this role and his portrayal of secretive living.To no surprise, the MacGuffin of this MCU film is the mantle of the Black Panther. I thought Coogler and team did an amazing job of telling this story with the absence of this figure, and allowing the characters to explore the majority of the movie to fill the void. The classic ""MCU moments"" definitely start creeping in the last 45 minutes of the film, when things started to become MCU-predictable, but I did feel Coogler was allowed a majority of the creative freedom he desired for the first ~2 hours of the film - and it paid off.Finally a job very well done by Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and especially Letitia Wright - who helmeted the lead role beautifully in the departure of her character's brother. Was unsure of how Wright would be in the lead role, but she left no doubts she is a star.From a critique standpoint, this movie easily could have cut off several minutes of ""fat"" from the final product. My least favorite moment of the movie was easily led by one returning character who did not fit in with the rest of the movie's theme. It didn't feel like the moment fit, but as always with the MCU- there's probably a reason for it.Overall well worth the watch, and I am looking forward to viewing again on D+ to give a closer look to more details."

",kashmiradissanayaka,/user/ur153038837/,11 November 2022,"The film was very beautiful. First of all, Chadwick Bosman was given a lot of respect in the movie. Action scenes are so great. Like the Thor LAT, it didn't mess with the gong jokes (but it's not that there weren't any jokes. The old Marvel vibe was there). Filmography was used beautifully throughout the movie. There were some emotional moments in between. Shuri's entrance as Black Panther had a good vibe. The most special thing to say is that this music album is amazing. There are some very beautiful soundtracks.(Personally, I like the song that plays when Namor and Shuri are taken to Talocan)

Unfortunately the absence of a strong on screen presence was obvious... there was an empty space where Chadwick should have been and at times i got a little bored. To be fair, it's likely no version would have been as good as the first but i do feel as though the characters were underdeveloped and the story itself feels far removed from the Wakanda story line i would have expected.

At times I felt like I was watching a weaker Aquaman/Avatar in places. I guess the music is okay and there are some okay shots here and there, but in the end it was way too long for what it was and even Chadwick's farewell seemed a bit rushed if you ask me.

They're showing what's Wakanda doing after their lost, and how are they communicating with other countries of world, which are wanting to get their own piece of vibranium. And after this first part of the movie, there appears Nemor. And I wanna say that he is really a great villain, one of my favorite Marvel villains now (okay, but his wings on his feet looks really weird). I liked the water army, with their warrior whales, water bombs and other. And I liked how Riri Williams appears in the plot, I thought she will be just a side character for fanservice and as a teaser of the Iron Heart series, but no. She was really an important character for the plot. Also I liked that the Marvel logo in the beginnig starts with Chadwick Boseman's scenes. And ends with it. Rest in piece legend...
So now I wanna talk about things I didn't liked in the movie. For the first - The world under the ocean. They showed it only visually, and it was beautiful. But they didn't show how works it, they didn't show how live there the people of there, what are they doing, where are they studying or work. I don't know, it was really good movie, but it was kinda... boring? I don't know, there were a lot of great action scenes, but sometimes i really wanted to sleep. Well, i recomend this movie, especially if you aren't marvel fans, but you want cotinue follow this universe. This had his own interesting plot, but there weren't an intrigue, had his interesting new places and locations, fantastic visual, and few nice fanservice scenes. This was good movie, but without Chadwick and Michael B Jordan (there was his mini cameo but it was too short) as main characters it wasn't so good, so I think 2 hours and 40 minutes too much for this. But i like it. I will rewatch it with subtitles, but I don't think that Im gonna rewatching this every year. 7/10."

",KassyL,/user/ur54616854/,11 November 2022,"The tone and feel of Ryan Coogler's Marvel Character THE BLACK PANTHER is a direct reflection of the movement of African Peoples around the world. It's different. This difference is highly embraced by the fans of this series as the world of Wakanda is the stuff that Black folk's dreams are made of. It's what we feel we truly are inside. It's our unique Sci Fi Fantasy and Ryan never disappoints. WAKANDA FOREVER makes us feel the loss of Chadwick Boseman at the same time filling the audience and fans up with rich images, exciting plot twists and blended culture to ease the pain. Letitia Wright gives a stellar performance! The introduction of another powerful ancient world is icing on the cake! Bravo!"
," Bad editing ruined it; the stellar score and wardrobe couldn't save it
",SureCommaNot,/user/ur27127577/,11 November 2022,"This film and its prequel both had exceptional visual design, particularly in the diverse wardrobe styles displayed, and throught-provoking instrumentation in the score. The score was particularly captivating this time around. But none of this could save the film from its pacing, clarity and consistency issues.Even if we forget the outright errors (where the audio didn't match the visuals), the film just had a lot of awkward silence, like the actors were expecting quick cuts and were just waiting for direction. There were hundreds of places I would have cut a second here, two seconds there, enough not only to bring some energy into the pacing, but also to buy more time to understand Namor's people. Little time is spent really getting to empathize with them. Even Namor's story lacked clarity and fleshing out.More than 90 minutes in, the story finally started to get interesting, with noteworthily well-done action sequences. But even then, it was painfully obvious that some sequences where done by entirely different teams, with completely inconsistent tonality. So it was hard to enjoy the good parts, with how different they were from the rest.I admit I had high hopes for the final film of Phase 4, but this just didn't deliver."
8," Empty
",cthirlby,/user/ur136469273/,11 November 2022,"Obviously this movie is a huge thing. Chadwick is a legend and will always be seen as the black panther. This movie was just so filler and boring with a pace that's way too slow for a 2 hour+ film. It's not a bad film it's just a long slog of a movie. Nothing big happens in the movie at all apart from the mantle passing of black panther, it's very empty. Compared to the first black panther it's a completely different tone and pace to it which wouldn't be a bad thing if the story was engaging. Shuri becoming the new black panther I expected due to comic knowledge and I'm happy with that and I thought her story was decent along with showing her dark side especially in her fight with Namor. All the performances were great and I liked Riri Williams as an addition to the MCU, whilst some of her scenes were stale and the suit looked like trash I'll stay open minded for her show. Namor was okay, he was cool to watch. Namor and his people let the story down as it was built up to be this huge war but ultimately led to nothing but boring and ugly fight scenes between everyone and this was in the whole movie too! Namor was interesting just a poorly written character mostly which was unfortunate. The post credit scenes were underwhelming and they did a fast and furious by naming a child after the character/person that died which was fine I guess but unnecessary. The comedy was great though even though it lacked which is what made it rewarding when it happened. The scenes honouring Chadwick were fantastic though leaving me to tear up with how connected I was along with the world to this person and character. Those scenes were special. Also the film ended the same as it started with empty threats of war between the two groups leaving no hype for the future and the overwhelming feeling of being unrewarding. Overall Black Panther Wakanda Forever pays a beautiful and emotional tribute to Chadwick but lacks heavily in a well written or engaging story."

It is one of the best MCU movies right next to No Way Home or Shang Chi but it has something more important than the atmosphere itself .. It is natural .. each character in the film plays his part as much as possible .. knowing that it is a tribute to Chadwick < 3The movie itself did not seem to be as long as everyone was saying .. you know, it has some moments that make it silly for some people .. in my opinion there was one moment in the film itself that could have been shown in a different way ..The plot itself .. interestingly led .. there are no big plot twists .. the main goal was to show the loss of the main character, how to handle it .. and I do not go deeper because spoilers;)CGI .. has a problem with himself at certain points .. and you can see that they are trying to cover some of the shortcomings, creating a blur of the area .. besides .. a really beautiful movie !!!Music ..

",TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,/user/ur2093818/,11 November 2022,"What happens when the world becomes aware of a country that is extremely powerful and wealthy?Everyone watching and working on this, we all miss Chadwick Boseman. This is not about replacing him. About maintaining a stride despite his tragic death. It is about honoring the legacy of him, and his performance as T'Challa. We find the fictional people who were closest to him torn apart by mourning. Each grieving in their own way. It is handled in a mature, intelligent way.As has been the case recently, the MCU continues to use sequels to not only follow up on the story and characters set up earlier in the series and overall franchise, but also introduce new ones. Your mileage may vary, but I was personally extremely impressed by how well it integrated all of them. This shows respect for, and shines a spotlight on, Mayan culture and history, the way that the original did for the African continent. I am very happy that they changed the location from the fictional Atlantis. Like Wakanda, Talocan genuinely feels like a place where people live and work. It's not just a cool setting that feels like a stage. Namor(Huerta, by turns charismatic and intense) is as fascinating and complex as in the comics, and there's no end to the narratives that they can explore now that he is part of this universe.This features sci-fi violence and a little moderate to strong language. I recommend this to everyone. 10/10."

",nasserhossainmondal,/user/ur140880820/,11 November 2022,"The perfect character build up of wakanda princess to a worthy Queen. We are sad for our lose , sir Chadwick Boseman was a legend, Director Rayan perfectly balanced the situation. Perfect tribute to favorite king T'Challa. VFX 8/10. Story build up 9/10. The performances all round are truly excellent and you forget this is a mostly women cast (not that it matters) When the action and stakes are ramped up by the third act it feels earned, not just edited in. I love the score, I love the moments of quiet and almost slowness and that it took its time. I loved the comedy sprinkled through. Also the 3D had moments but mostly I didn't notice it. A couple of negatives, runtime feels a little long and I could have done with a little more action but these are nitpicks to what is ultimately a great movie and touching tribute to Chadwick Boseman. Highly recommended."

",Jeremy_Urquhart,/user/ur26226712/,11 November 2022,"Phase 4's MCU comes to a close with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. It's been a truly inconsistent run of films. There was the good (Shang-Chi, Spider-Man, some of Dr. Strange 2), the eh (other parts of Dr. Strange 2, Black Widow and Eternals), and the ugly (Thor 4, which is easily the worst MCU movie so far). If this movie had been bad, it might have been enough to make me bail on keeping up with the MCU's movies, and truth be told, I've already bailed on the Disney+ series', because WandaVision, Falcon & Winter Soldier, and Loki really didn't do it for me.If you're expecting Black Panther 2 to wrap up Phase 4, you might be disappointed. But then again, there hasn't been a consistent narrative to the last two years of Marvel releases, so there's really nothing to conclude, overall. Importantly, it's just a very good movie, and that's enough to ensure it ends Phase 4 on a high. It's not a total slam-dunk, but there's a great deal about Black Panther 2 that's extremely effective, and enough great stuff that I feel the overall movie is a strong one.I think the pacing is its greatest strength. I really didn't feel the 2 hour 40 minute runtime. The opening half-hour doesn't flow the best, but there was a need to adjust after Chadwick Boseman's passing meant T'Challa died, too. Once the movie establishes this and sets up its main plot, it's pretty smooth-sailing, and unlike many Marvel movies, it saves its most emotional moments and best action scenes for its excellent final hour.It's a very emotional movie, and the way it pays respect to Boseman and T'Challa is essentially perfect. With good action, a solid story, a very good new antagonist (Namor and the whole underworld were great), and fantastic music (maybe the best Marvel score so far?), this was a very good MCU movie, and gives me a little more hope for the franchise going forward."
7," A beautiful and poignant follow-up!
",DhanuRated,/user/ur76314306/,11 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is once again directed by Ryan Coogler, who's had a difficult task to continue the franchise, after the tragic passing of its main star, Chadwick Boseman. Thanks to the creative team and the cast members, Coogler managed to make a worthy sequel that not only honors Boseman, but also turns out to be a triumph for the MCU.Although the absence of T'Challa could be felt throughout the picture, it does not stop Ryan Coogler's Black Panther: Wakanda Forever from being a strong, yet poignant continuation, filled with mind-blowing visuals, exceptional character arcs, and outstanding performances that moves the MCU franchise forward in a gratifying way."
5," A messy Phase finale elevated by a loving tribute
",TheVictoriousV,/user/ur19932818/,11 November 2022,"Virtually all movies and shows from Phase Four of the MCU (or Marvel Cinematic Universe for you Silent Genarationers out there) have one very significant problem in common.It's not the fact that they no longer indicate a clear common goal and now seem to compete in who can introduce the most awesome new character or ""next Infinity Gauntlet"" contender, yet also treat those revelations as throwaway adventures-of-the-week that largely go unmentioned by other canon media. (If you're extra nerdy, questions like ""How has nobody brought up the Book of Vishanty, Eternity, the Egyptian gods, or the Eternals earlier?"", ""Why didn't any one of said entities help fight Thanos?"", and the classic ""So where are the Avengers right now?"" have been more nagging than ever.) That's a problem too, certainly, but it's not the one I'm talking about today.Instead, it's a problem best illustrated by the way people responded to the trailer for Phase Four's finale, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever: ""Holy sh-t! This one actually looks like a movie!""Indeed, most of the other Phase Four media feels like the same thing: commercial sludge made in a cold, soulless factory to meet a Disney+ content quota before a set date (yes, even the theatrical releases had this feel to them), where the most interesting artistry and personality come in the form of Raimi's weird editing in Multiverse of Madness or Waititi being more unfunny than ever with Thor: Love and Thunder. Meanwhile, Wakanda Forever seemed to have acting, framing, music, and special effects that felt genuinely cinematic.In no world should ""it feels like a movie"" constitute a remarkable point of praise for a film. Alas, we live in a world of Thor: Love and Thunder and Ant-Man: Quantumania (the preview for which is the most ""Spy Kids"" that the MCU has looked yet, on top of displaying some truly clunky compositions) so what can ya do?There are some aspects of Wakanda Forever that look thrown together (don't get me started on the CGI for ""Not Atlantis"" in some shots, or a certain costume that I'll get to later), but it never looks like an ad for Bluetooth speakers the way that Love and Thunder often did (sometimes literally). By the start, it also seems to opt for a relatively small and personal story -- largely concerned with Shuri (Letitia Wright), Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett), and the other Wakandans processing the passing of King T'Challa and the implications of Wakanda unveiling itself to the world -- instead of going on another multidimensional roller-coaster ride where ""all life"" is at stake (on Earth or in the totality of existence) that goes so over-the-top that it becomes boring.Sadly, what we ultimately end up with is still very much a post-Endgame MCU movie: There ""need"" to be cameos and subplots. There ""need"" to be references to The Blip. There ""needs"" to be a globe-trotting quest involving special new items and superheroes. There ""needs"" to be a set-up for a future TV show starring Dominique Thorne's new Ironheart character -- whose costume is so laughable that it took me a good minute to realize that the promo pic circulating online was from the actual film and not the Turkish bootleg. As Robert Daniels wrote in his review, the transition from T'Challa's funeral to the Marvel logo is a sign of things to come.Sure, we don't get unnecessary post-credits teases for Doctor Doom or Galactus or whatever, but one still gets the impression that Ryan Coogler didn't have the same freedom with this one. Black Panther was relatively self-contained and, in a way, ""deeper"" than many other MCU titles; I once dismissed it as merely being ""good for a Marvel film"" (which still rings true on the level of art direction, acting, and such) but appreciate it more in retrospect. As YouTube essayist F. D. Signifier argues in a highly interesting video, it did something new for the way black characters (and the dualisms/conflicts of the ""black psyche""), as well as the African continent, are depicted in media -- namely, media of this size, reach, and success. Hollywood product or not, there's a reason its Afrofuturism and themes resonated with viewers in a way that transcended fandoms.I was hoping that Wakanda Forever would similarly set itself apart from Phase Four. Truth is, the Phase has ended on a jumbled note; a tug-of-war between a universe-building studio and a movie-maker who wants to do something halfway serious -- not the least of which is paying tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman.Fans have argued enough about what the best option would be vis-à-vis Boseman's passing: Would it have been tasteless to simply recast him, or is it worse to ""milk"" his real-world death -- to ""monetize his corpse"", as one critic put it -- by killing T'Challa off-screen and turning his demise into a crucial plot element? I'm not sure where I stand on the killing-off vs recasting of T'Challa as such, but wish to note that we likely wouldn't be asking that question if this wasn't ultimately a comic book product (designed to sell toys and future adventures) and just a genuine, personal, and untarnished piece of art by Ryan Coogler. Something tells me it was gonna feel weird one way or the other.Maybe it's not my place to say, partly because I can't possibly know how Boseman would've felt about this being the format his eulogy took, but also because, hey, I'm not a part of the ""true"" intended audience here:As someone pointed out on TikTok, what's really important is that we let PoC viewers ""have"" this movie, enjoy it in peace, and be the ones to speak on what is or isn't appropriate. I straight-up saw someone ask that white folks don't even go see this film in a theater on premiere night. Out of respect for this supplication, I watched Wakanda Forever on a pirated CAMRip and so got a double whammy by not having to give Disney any money. You're welcome, guys!"

",frisoflorentinus,/user/ur67553820/,11 November 2022,"I walked in thinking that without Chadwick Boseman that this movie would fill empty. I was right but they wrote and portrayed a story about when death happens, it does leave a 'hole' so to speak. Very impressed with all the characters and their arcs and found myself rooting for the anti hero Namor. This movie does an amazing job at tears, shocks and world building. They knew they couldn't do this movie better than the first because of Chadwick's death, but they produced a solid movie. Will for sure watch a second time in the movie theater. Its hard to continue without Chadwick Boseman, but the movie does justice to his character and the ending is promising for the future."

",ankanbiswasthedarkknight,/user/ur42187454/,11 November 2022,"Following up 2018's superb Black Panther was never going to be an easy task but kudos to Marvel. I think this is probably the best they could have done with what they had and didn't have(R. I. P Chadwick Boseman). This film is a eulogy to T'Challa as well as Boseman. Long live the King! The villain has an intriguing arc which justifies his actions unlike most MCU films. However, he falls considerably short of the memorable Killmonger from the first film of the franchise. The cast did a commendable job especially Leticia Wright, Danai Gurira and Angela Bassett. Those who were merely supporting characters in BP were here elevated to main roles and they rose to the occasion. The background score was superb just like BP. One drawback was the subplot which was jarring. This film may not match its predecessor for impact but it certainly does(and arguably surpasses) it for sentiment. All in all, this was marvelous(no pun intended)."

",tejassawant13,/user/ur131478398/,11 November 2022,"No spoiler review. As the Film opens up with an excellent yet emotional start the story sets a tone for a movie. It's promising. Wakanda Forever is definitely the best phase four movie for its screenplay.The film takes time to set up the characters and their motivations throughout the journey.It has good buildup. Every single character especially Shur has good character development throughout the movie.The first act of the movie is the best part. It shows you how the characters are so promising and promising for their coming decisions. The tone of the film is a bit dark yet engaging. We all get engaged in what's happening, even the conversation scenes between the characters are impressive.The movie holds you till the last minute. This is one of those movies where you care for the protagonist because the antagonist of the movie is so strong and clear about what he wants. You listen to him so carefully for what he speaks.The second act is a bit slow but not boring. And the final act is not up to the mark but definitely a good closure for the film.Direction: Directed by Ryan Coogler. The direction is so impressive. I love how the director introduced each character. The pacing of the story fits the script. It evolves like magic.Good direction.Writing: Writing by Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole is superb. It gets justice to the project. Especially screenplay. The screenplay is so perfect. I loved it. Well-written characters, engaging events, and dialogues. So good arcs for all characters.Perfect.Cinematography: Cinematography by Autumn Durald Arkapaw is good for underwater sequences. It felt real, raw, and also so magical. I love the way they showcased underwater nature. Not so colorful and vibrant, but real. Good take.Music and sound design: Created by Ludwig Göransson, Music is always so amazing and catchy.

8," It's great but not as magical as the first.
",subxerogravity,/user/ur59627333/,11 November 2022,"I could not wait to see what the film was going to do about the death of Black Panther star, Chadwick Boseman. That curiosity may have affected my judgement.The movie is a tribute to the life lost. Boseman was the Black Panther and this movie was about losing the Black Panther and what that did to the nation of Wakanda, which got far more airtime in this movie. Wakanda felt more real here than it did in number one. Now I totally want to go there.Despite being a sequel, Boseman's death makes it feel like they have to start over, so it feels like an origin story. For superhero movies that can slow down the film and technically, the film is telling three at once, which slowed it down a lot. With T'challa making his first appearance in Captain America: Civil War not even Black Panther needed to do this much heavy lifting with the origins.The originally movie had an ensemble cast just like this one, but it's interesting how director Ryan Coogler seemed to film the movie with this notion of how much they needed King T'Challa to be their center piece which ironically made the same ensemble cast that was great in the first one very lackluster in this one. In addition, it is a little over stuff. I loved Julia Louis Dreyfus as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, but it does feel they could have cut her part to make the film shorter and it would not affect the story at all.Despite that, Wakanda Forever is able to stand alone as a movie, but as a fan of the Marvel Cinematic universe, I could have use more connections to the universe other than a few words here and there. Like I know very little about RiRi Williams but I thought it was strange that the character of Iron Heart did not refer to Iron man in any fashion, or maybe that is just me.I loved what they did with Namor in the film, but honestly, I can see why you would not. If you are a comic book fan you'll noticed that the jerk of an anti-hero screaming ""Imperius Rex!"" as he rightfully seeks vengeance on the surface world is exactly how Tenoch Huerta plays the part, but his background is vastly different than what I recognize from the comic. Change is good, but I have to get use to it so bare with me. Thankfully, it helps that he said those magic words that foreshadow a certain franchise to be integrated into the Marvel Cinematic universe.I feel like I tore this movie apart when I do not think it deserves that. I like it in all but it's not my favorite. Its not as epic as Black Panther."

",nadeemthethird,/user/ur108911210/,11 November 2022,Director Ryan Coogler takes on an impossible task. That task would be how to make a sequel without your main star. With the unfortunate passing of Chadwick Bosermen the early stages of the movie was in shambles. But Ryan Coogler came out with a fantastic story. Wakanda Forever did something that a few films made me do that is to make you feel like death is really hitting you. The emotion that people went through watching this was unbelievable. How can you add so much emotions in one film? The story wise was great. When you have to deal with a passing of your one lead. It's groundbreaking. The film main villain Namor (Tenoch Huerta) was a really refreshing take. The past few MCU flims was lacking a really good villain but in this one it was redeemed back again. Now there is a majority of elements of story that I agree with but with its runtime of 2hr 41min. There was something's that could've been left out. Angela Bassett (Ramonda) was spectacular. She took what she could make and made it ten times more better. One of the best acting performances I seen in the MCU. Dominique Thorne (Iron heart) was very much enjoyable. When you have a film that deals with so much grief. You need a character to break the ice with and she did exactly that. Can't wait to see her in Disney+ iron heart. The one and only new Black Panther Letitia Wright Aka (Shuri). Gave a incredible performance. I could only imagine the news that shoud got explaining that she would have to be the new Black Panther and a short amount of Time. She was great she took what she can and what she experienced with Chadwick Bosermen Black Panther and made it her own. Well done. So at the end everyone who worked on this film did an amazing job. Thanks you Kevin Feige and Ryan Coogler for the great film it was a great way to end Phase 4 of the MCU. You guys did an impossible task....

They use Wakanda Forever in the movie too many times and it loses the power it had behind it like in the first film.

First of all talking about visuals. This movie was beautifully shot, close-ups as well as wide shots were a treat to the eye. It almost always felt right, keeping in touch with vibrant, Marvel-Movie-Type colours.I absolutely loved the score, which especially contributed to specific and truly unforgettable scenes. Ludwig Goransson´s work has an incredible impact on this film, bringing back what he created for the first Black Panther and adding new scores to the sequel.Letitia Wright as Shuri moved the audience with her astonishing performance. As this film was paying tribute to Chadwick Boseman in various ways, she seemed to be the perfect vessel for it. Not surprisingly, Angela Bassett did amazingly well as Ramonda once again. The overall performances of the cast were impressive, acting out their own strong arcs and bringing their characters to life.The film did have a slight downside with the newly introduced character Riri. The story seemed to revolve around her, although she as a person was never fully introduced. Riri felt more like a quick acquaintance almost without a real character arc. This could have been due to her limited screen time or lack of presence overall.Although this last aspect was a bit unfortunate, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is definitely worth a watch!"

The way they touch on grief and the many different ways people handle it was truly remarkable and Shuri's journey was great to see. The mid credit scene... hits the feels so HARD !!!!

7," Starts strong burns out slowly
",mjtothemax3,/user/ur17650727/,11 November 2022,"Wakanda Forever had me from the get go. The pace was perfect, the tribute was elegant, the introduction of Namor and his people was great, the action was heart pounding.... And then the rest happened. The film needed a stronger lead to follow throughout the film but how can you if you don't recast T'Challa? The film ultimately suffered from that absence but when you lose your star player the rest of the team generally suffers somewhat. Angela Bassett was great, probably the most impactful I've seen her in some time. Love Okoye in this one... She had the best action scene in the whole film. Shuri, Nakia, Umbaku, and Namor had their moments to shine but just like great role players they are not perfect stars but solid nonetheless. The outfit choices and some poor CGI, a long with a slog of a middle portion of the film is what dragged this down out of the top 10 MCU films for me. Fyi younger kids will likely not enjoy this film due to the mature themes throughout and lack of entertaining scenes."
7," I wanted to LOVE this film, I think my expectations were too high.
",acewells,/user/ur134858590/,11 November 2022,"Beautiful tribute to Chadwick in the opening scenes, great moment of silence as well. The acting was good, the script wasn't bad, POC and women represented well too. I can't put my finger on exactly what was lacking. Maybe the pace, the length of the movie or the special effects I'm not sure. It just wasn't good. However It wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination. When I left the theater after the first one there was applause and everyone doing the ""Wakanda Forever"" move. This one was silent and almost a head scratcher. Like it feels bad to dislike this film. But I was disappointed. This new Marvel Phase is horrible."

",mranan,/user/ur115836155/,11 November 2022,"It depends on how you feel after coming out of the theatre , I felt fulfilled,the plot of the story was really great and It felt like I can't wait to watch black panther 3. Those people who are complaining this movie is slow placed just be ashamed of yourself, you guys are one who wants a movie to have a good plot and want the villain to be developed but when it becomes slow paced you guys complain. Grow up people . This is the best movie of the phase 4 and the characters were really well developed and Angela basset and Leticia wright were just amazing to watch and don't enter theatre with high expectations and just watch the story fold itself. Namor is a really good villain and the new black panther was just developed unbelievably."
5," Phase 4: You did it again..
",tingeltangelmob,/user/ur69099450/,11 November 2022,"The legacy was great, but unfortunately the sequel lacks any energy, lasting images, heart, understanding of the culture, vibrancy of costumes, character development and cool that the first part brought.I had high hopes for this film, but unfortunately it carries all the ills of this Marvel phase. References to ongoing series on Disney+, introduction of a new character for another spin-off, half-hearted farewell to an old hero.How aimless Marvel sails into the future is underscored by the abandonment of a post-credit scene.What you can look forward to is a driving soundtrack by Ludwig Göransson and a sympathetic performance by M'Baku."
5," Disappointing
",bocsi-zsolt-469-235921,/user/ur36200354/,11 November 2022,"I had high hopes on this movie, and some of my hopes they were managed to fulfill. The antagonist is quite cool and bold and they havent killed him in the end, so i am sure we will meet him again in the future as well as the people of mayan atlantis. Having a female black panther - since the original actor demised - felt natural to me. So this is not just a pointless gender swapping.On the other hand the story is full of plotholes, some terrible action scenes, (some 1v1 fights were amazing though) boring dialogues. Knock of Ironman etc. I think it is the worst pro endgame movie so far. Black Adam with all of it's flaws were much better than this. And i am not even a DC fan."

10," A perfect movie.
",Marios345,/user/ur155066520/,11 November 2022,"The movie was perfect.Ok it had some flaws like the suits of Okoye and Riri and the CGI on some long-distance Namor flying scenes
But despite all that it was a perfect movie with perfect acting ( Shuri, Namor, and the Queen mother especially) and excellent writing paying a beautiful tribute to Chadwick's Black Panther.So it's very disappointing when I see reviews here who want to bury black panther maybe because Chadwick died. But these reviews are disrespectful to the actors, the director, Chadwick, and his family.It was the perfect end for phase 4, so don't try to bury it because you miss Chadwick, we miss him too but we aren't disrespectful."
9," Absolutely Better Than Last 2 Marvel Movie Projects.
",karthikkarthikck,/user/ur87841063/,11 November 2022,"With all the Emotions, This movie was great. I loved it. There are some flaws but comparing with last 2 movies from Marvel studios, any small flaws could be forgotten easily. I Enjoyed This Movie very much and boy ohh boy Namor is the freaking bad ass villian, Awesome. Better Anti-hero story arc than Black Adam that's crazy. Emotional rollercoaster. Every Actors performance was amazing, it's not like any other typical Marvel movie filled with many action pieces with very short Story Plot, this movie is full of Good Story Plot and individual story Arcs. I Can definitely say this, this movie does not disappoint."
2," If you want to watch a good Black Panther movie, watch the first one again.
",patlm,/user/ur158708985/,11 November 2022,"I'd like to say that this movie lived up to, or even came relatively close to its predecessor, however that would be far from the truth. The story, characters, and care taken with the first movie was absolutely thrown out the window for the second. Apart from one performance, all characters felt flat and cardboard like - with clunky dialogue and unnecessary storylines crowing an already long film. I wanted to connect and really feel for our main protagonists, however the sheer amount of jumping around, and a lack of story beats truly made it hard for the emotional moments to really hit home. Where the previous film was praised for the way it presented the different tribes and celebrated culture, this film (aside from the opening sequences) pushed it far far to the side, and felt very superficial in its treatment of that previous sentiment (for both known and new peoples). The fight scenes were busy and not impactful, with far too much jumping around, characters mysteriously gained and lost strength depending on who they were fighting, and it seemed like the most dangerous thing in the movie was a water grenade in varying numbers. I would like to say the sound design was good (the last films was excellent) but there was so much abrupt licensed music that killed the mood, that I would struggle even saying that.If I had one redeeming thing to say, it would be that occasionally there was a shot that looked pretty. If you want to see a good black panther movie, I would suggest rewatching the first one."
8," Wakanda, Forever Strong and Emotional, But Lacking Balance This Time
",rgkarim,/user/ur25226117/,11 November 2022,"LIKES:The Acting: Don't worry, just because it is first does not mean the movie stinks. Quite opposite really, but I just found the other parts much better than the acting in this case. The second outing with Wakanda is loaded with spicy performance and every one of them is just as layered and complex as the characters they portray. Gurira is much more than the warrior in this film, she expanded the leader's role to so much more that her character had a more well-rounded tone to play well with the other character. Nyong'o rocks when she shows up, again adding more complexity to what was once two qualities and expanding her character to so much more than what we initially got in the first movie. Her usage was not only well-done, but the woman knows how to play these roles organically and just impose them onto herself to really bring a victory to the acting game. Wright though, wow did she crush the role. Shuri was once sort of the goofy brat of a sister with some harder tones during the less silly moment, but in this film, she really takes a whole new mantle. Wright portrays everything so well, not really straying into territory that is overacted or ridiculous to handle. A point to weigh anchors on, Wright hands down is my favorite of the cast for all that she brought to the character and the chemistry she had with everyone else.The Emotion Thanks to the acting, alongside music, cinematography, and planning, Wakanda forever accomplishes much in diving into the emotional ell. It's a much deeper reflection on real life than the other films, really focusing on the comic aspects of a character facing a hard time in their lives. As the movie progresses, that emotion just extends more, with connections, character arcs, and history that play to a number of audience members to potentially anchor themselves too. That relatability drives the point home, and I found myself going on the journey with them as they fought to face the demons from within, both figuratively and literally to some degree. Caution for those with younger audience members, because the movie is more for the adult audiences than the younger fans might appreciate.The Culture: Again like the first installment, Black Panther's focus on culture and story are always incredible for this reviewer in terms of the natural flow he visualizes them in. The events of this story really thrive on the understanding of so many cultural aspects of the kingdoms and even the world, trying to convey them without becoming too preachy. For the most part, they succeeded for me, really engaging in setting up all the future Marvel settings with a personality and spirit that serves as a foundation for the kingdoms. It pays respects to the real life influences, and makes it as much a character quirk as the characters themselves. This integration really spoke to me, and was again a strong game played by the director and visionary team.The Dramatic And Layered Story: As mentioned above, Wakanda forever is a very heavy story focused moment, with a story layered with drama and growth. It's a movie that takes all the emotion, and evolves it into something I find matching a few of the graphic novel plots I've read. There is connectivity, studying, and understanding of the world, trying to take the grief of a kingdom, and still try to fit into a world constantly on the hunt for power and control. Those themes of course stay, but yet blossom into something else as more and more strategic play occurs, crafting this board of characters for a much deeper story. The ups and downs with the emotional connection mentioned earlier only expands that layer, taking the movie into a more artistic Marvel film than other films have tried in the past.The Messages Are Classy: Given all the culture and politics in the movie, you might expect a lot of political agenda checking in play. To an extent there is, I won't lie at some of the heavy-handed elements that they are pushing. Yet, it's not the worst thing to come out of the Marvel Studio. Black Panther's messages are again presented well, classy and pertinent to the story whose messages extend past beating Thanos. When baked in as well as they were, I found myself really not getting too bogged down by many of the ""empowering"" messages, because they were balanced with the other aspects and helping progress the story. Thus, I give that a win in my book.The Character Development By far, the movie is really a great dive into the character psyche of a Marvel character and giving you a strong character story with it. Black Panther's group are really taken to levels that are rare to see in movies today. The anguish, the torture, and all the feelings are beautifully presented, giving you characters that far extend past the costumes they wear. Like a good soap opera, this movie really explores the facets of human society, providing a window to gaze into and do your own soul searching. And to tie the characters together in such amounts, well I couldn't help but be drawn into the stories these figure had and the journey they took to grow and become something stronger. That right there was perhaps the strongest element of this movie and certainly the lifeline most audience members will become enamored with.DISLIKES:The Pacing: For all the good this movie had though, the pacing was not my favorite in the grand scheme of Marvel movies. At nearly three hours, this movie's slowness could be felt at times, drawn out, a bit boring, and uneven to the point of requiring me to fight off sleep. Certainly the extra layers and character centric story are interesting and deep, but this movie lacks the action kick and props that other Marvel movies do so much better. So much build up and excitement for very exciting elements dwindled to inconsistent moments that felt off to me and sometimes dilated the time effect. It's by far more thrilling than say the Eternals, but, the movie is certainly slower than several other entries in Phase 4.The Action Is A Step Down For Me: One of my biggest disappointments, Black Panther 2 took a step back from the action the first movie brought. Certainly there are cool moves to watch, slow motion spectacles and few choreographed exchanges that I liked. And yet, the consistency and polish of these moments feels off for me in regards to the smoothness of their execution. Like a DC film, the elevated message bled into the fights and led to short lived moments and messy montages that felt hastily edited together in sort of a highlight real. These quick bouts ended abruptly, just did not give our characters the moment in the sun, and kind of felt sloppy or too elevated from what I wanted. All the buildup, the trailers, and the talk sort of died away and even the final fight felt like an afterthought when the drama was done so well.Was Okay With Riri's inclusion: Riri was a character that could have gone either way for me, but her inclusion was fine for the most part. And yet, I don't think it was necessary in the grand scheme of the story. She has potential for many crossover events and tie ins for the future, but in this film, it was another character that seemed somewhat an afterthought for the inclusion. The moments in the story are, okay, holding that empowering message, comedic moments and some other elements that look cool. However, I could also have gotten the meat of this movie without her there, envisioning a version with most of her scenes gone and potentially getting a better movie if they had replaced her with other characteristics.Too Much in One Movie: This is something that I think has become a big focus in Disney's world of franchise establishment. Black Panther's second film is all about introducing a lot of things, setting up a ton of the next phase in an attempt to lay the groundwork for the deluge of stuff coming in the next phase. While it's not quite as big of a springboard as say She-Hulk, it still put a lot of things into the nearly 3 hours, some of which could have waited for another movie or show to do without taking away from the other things. Again, Coogler make a loving movie, but at the same time could have minimized how much was put in so I could enjoy the effects to the fullest.The VERDICT:Did Black Panther 2 live up to the hype? On some levels, it very much did from what I expected of the movie. Coogler really did make an emotional masterpiece, this incredible film that is all about establishing worlds, cultures, and taking a look at the world's problems through a superhero lens. It handles a lot of things well, and integrate life's facets into a very good story that is character centric and relationship building to really evolve roles that were secondary in the first film. That chemistry, that relatability, and the manner to which they shot the film all point to next level story telling in regards to that drama themed story that ABC series do. If you like this, you're going to love this movie, but caution as the movie is a bit more adult paced than the usual movie, and so younger audiences may not like this one or be scared by this one a little. And in that regards, the movie is also not as balanced in terms of entertainment as the first film was in my opinion. Riri was great, but just didn't feel entirely needed, alongside several other components that got touched on. Meanwhile, the pace and the action suffered more for me in this movie and left me a bit more bored if I wasn't caught up in the emotional elements of the movie. I think it handled way too much in one film, and while most was handled beautifully, having all that stuff just did not accomplish the full balance for me. With all this in mind, the movie's scores for me are:Action/Adventure/Drama: 7.5-8.5 depending on the drama
Movie Overall: 7.0."

",nigelpratheek,/user/ur151607740/,11 November 2022,Glad to see marvel ending phase 4 on a high note. The movie was just spectacular and the CGI this time was mind blowing. Easily comparable to endgame. Excellent storyline and screen play. Worth the wait and kept to the expectations. Be prepared to expect everything from this movie. It's an action packed movie filled with spectacular fight scenes. And Namor was just a perfect villain and matched up to our expectations. The background music selections was so good and gave goosebumps in certain scenes. A movie that should be watched only the theaters to a get a proper sense of the missing cast member who is Chadwick Boseman.
7," Ryan coogler needs every bit of praise for handling this film.
",DocteurDream,/user/ur55801259/,11 November 2022,"Wakanda forever is mostly about mourning, moving on and the limbo that comes after a loss. It's is well written to tie it into the future events and the past marvel movies, it definitely lacks the big moments marvel films are known for and rightly so - because this movie is all about loss and coming to terms with it. It is melodrama with an attached superhero connotation. That doesn't mean it is not entertaining, but it is definitely gonna disappoint if you walk in expecting a typical marvel film.Ryan Coogler handled the transition from what was wakanda with Chadwick Boseman, to what it is going it be. The characters were well written, well developed and every actor did their best on screen doing justice to their roles.Tenoch Huerta's Namor is not your average marvel anti hero. There is a lot of depth to his character and I hope it is developed well as the movies go further. I especially loved the fact that they did not make the character inherently evil, which would mean the sense of urgency would hurt the soul of what this movie is trying to be.Wakanda Forever is a necessary film for both the fans and the people of wakanda in the marvel universe. Overall a movie well done."

",jibinskywalker,/user/ur137907713/,11 November 2022,"""Wakanda Forever"" is MCU's 30-th movie and is phenomenal! The most powerful project of Phase 4. I can not understate how masterful the score is from start to finish. There are no weak links in the cast, but I have to give a special shoutout to Angela Basset and Letitia Wright's Shuri. Letitia is quite the beating heart of this film. And Tenoch Huerta? They couldn't have found a better Namor.""Ryan Coogler's emotional movies is about loss, legacy and healing. The story is intimate, but vast with global power struggles and palace intrigue. Tenoch Huerta's Namor is a force, better than I hoped. So much can be told...The scope, the camera work, the acting, and the raw emotions on and off screen can be felt throughout! Fantastic sequel and a great movie. I knew it'd be emotional and it was. Expect your eyes to leak.Immensely powerful story of forging forward-shattering at times, but also beautifully cathartic and heartening, still cannot get over how well the film earns that title.If Chadwick could see this movie, he'll be proud as much as I am right now!"

Technically, the action set pieces are mostly riveting, despite some inconsistent VFX and lighting. Score and sound production stand out in a remarkably memorable manner.Brutally passionate, moving performances, especially from Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, and Danai Gurira. Exquisite pacing reduces the weight of the long runtime.Totally worth the emotional investment.""Rating: B+"
8," Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett & Tenoch Huerta deliver the goods in this rousing tribute to the memory of Chadwick Boseman
",nidhunmoviebuff,/user/ur111831007/,11 November 2022,"No franchise within the vaunted Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) had ever managed to create the hype and goodwill of ""Black Panther (2018)"" when it released for the first time, showcasing yet again that cinema has power like no other medium to make traditionally marginalised communities feel empowered and represented in popular culture. Director Ryan Coogler and company carry on the good work they initiated in 2018, expanding the Black Panther subverse to include Meso-American culture and ethos in the best possible way, paying rich tribute to the memory of Chadwick Boseman in the process.We rejoin Shuri (Letitia Wright) and Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) in the techno-futuristic African country of Wakanda as they mourn the loss of Prince T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) after he dies of a mysterious ailment. As the country comes to grips with the loss of their charismatic leader, new threats start to emerge from the woodworks, chief among them a winged mer-man ""Namor"" (Tenoch Huerta) who seems to represent a hidden Meso-American tribe with access to ungodly amounts of Vibranium, who doesn't seem to have peaceful co-existence on his agenda. How Wakanda handles this disruptive change to the global power structure forms the rest of the story.Tenoch Huerta is an absolute revelation as ""Namor"", a winged mutant superhero based in the depths of the ocean, a Marvel Comics creation that came much before DC Comics' ""Aquaman"", in 1939, created by writer-artist Bill Everett. Kevin Feige and the think tanks at Marvel brilliantly reconned his origin story from Greek origins based in Atlantis to Meso-American heraldry that achieved the proverbial ""hitting two birds with one stone"" bullseye. Not only does it expand the universe to represent Latin American culture and sensibilities, but it also neatly avoids comparisons with DC's Jason Momoa-led ""Aquaman"" franchise.With stunning imagery, dance and musical numbers and moving farewell and tribute sequences, ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" will be enshrined as a fitting farewell to Chadwick Boseman, who reflected everything expected of a true superhero even in his real life, by bravely fighting cancer. With the introduction of Dominque Thorne aka ""Iron Heart"" and the revelation of ""Namor"" as MCU's second mutant after ""Ms Marvel"", the film also serves up the promise of a mouth-watering upcoming Phase 5 as vaunted Phase 4 draws to a close. ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is now playing in a theatre near you and is highly recommended!"
1," Chadwicks Absence is Felt, as is the lack of acknowledged canon.
",adamvdsb,/user/ur156130327/,11 November 2022,"I really wanted to enjoy this movie, sadly even for an action film this lacked a cohesive plot, any meaningful character development and any of the gravitas that Chadwick brought to the previous film.In addition the fight scenes were lacking in choreography and impact.The principal antagonist was compelling, but not Namor from a canonical perspective, they could have used a new character and it would have had a greater impact rather than having to glory trade off of a character for whom they used the name alone.Letitia Wright and Tenoch Huerta were the stand out performances.The most dire, contrived and totally without value inclusion was IronHeart, her story was simply stealing valor from Tony Stark, the suit was dire both in design and execution and the scripted lines abysmal.After Love and Thunder and She Hulk I didnt think Marvel could sink any lower, alas I was wrong!"

I did like the flashbacks at the end showing Chadwick it was sad. Then it said Black Panther will return I'm like give it up, let it died with Chadwick nobody will fill his shoes.

6," A good sequel that honors Boseman's legacy and that of T'Challa and Black Panther
",nscoby93,/user/ur39717569/,11 November 2022,"Before going into Wakanda Forever I made sure to avoid IMDb and Letterboxd so as to not see reviews and ratings. I wanted to truly give this film a chance. A complete unaffected, unbiased opinion so that I maybe open minded to whatever they do in this sequel. To further emphasize on how much I wanted to give this film it's honest chance I was even willing to put on blinders to the trash Disney/Marvel has produced in recent months.With all that said Wakanda Forever is a solid sequel and entry into the MCU. This film had a lot of great moments that made me very happy. The acting was great, the cinematography was beautiful, the cgi while at times weak was mostly well done definitely better than recent Disney/Marvel productions looking at you She Hulk. The score was great, I loved when they incorporated some music from the first film with some of the new. Making things better it's pretty apparent Disney stayed out of the way and kept their crap agenda mostly out.Before going further I must mention while Chadwick Boseman's absence is apparent his spirit is in this film. They pay tremendous homages to T'Challa. But what I appreciated the most about this film was how different it felt, not your standard superhero affair. They chose to put a lot of focus on how Wakanda and these characters are affected without King T'Chala. They also spent a lot of time developing the character who would pick up the mantle of Black Panther, and the ending I think honored T'Challa very well. Although while I enjoyed this aspect of the film I think it may not sit well with audience members seeking said standard superhero affair. Especially with the consideration Black Panther is only in this film for like 30 or 20 minutes.But with all this good there is still a rain cloud, the story while interesting didn't really captivate me for the entire runtime. Which will lead me to my next issue, this film is unnecessarily long at 2 hours and 41 minutes and due to minor pacing issues it felt closer to 3 hours. Then of course the cgi, as I said before it does hold up for the most part but there are multiple scenes where the background is obviously cgi causing the immersion to be broken. Normally it wouldn't be such a big deal to me but with the amount of money Disney puts in these films and even how the last Black Panther had better cgi in this regard there's no excuse.Overall while I did enjoy this film and it's clear that Ryan Coogler and company set out to make a worthy sequel that would honor Chadwick Boseman's legacy it unfortunately just doesn't quite live up to it's predecessor. The final score is one I struggled to come to because as much as I wanted to push it to an 8 it's those issues that bogged things down for me.IMDb: 7/10
Letterboxd: 3/5Watched in Theaters."
8," Coogler carried this movie on his shoulders.
",drawlife,/user/ur14294603/,11 November 2022,"The odds were against BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER. It just was. The lead actor Chadwick Boseman tragically passed away two years ago and you had to start from scratch. I don't know how Ryan Coogler managed all this stress, because it's hard enough to make a movie as is.I was in the camp of favoring recasting. I respectfully disagreed with not re-casting the role of T'challa. I feel that despite the wonderful job Chadwick has done, the character is always bigger than the actor. As a comics fan, I felt T'challa had a lot more to give in the MCU as his story just started. But, on the other hand I do understand why Disney and Marvel didn't.Letita Wright is now front and center and she displays great acting chops showcasing Shuri's state of mind without really saying what she's thinking. There's a lot of showing, instead of telling. Through her lens we experience loss, grief and revenge all in one. It's done in a mature fashion and I savored it up because that's when I think the MCU is at its best. It's no secret in my other reviews I always say that I love it when Marvel goes serious like the CAPTAIN AMERICA films and the first IRON MAN or INFINITY WAR. I'm pleased that WAKANDA FOREVER is within that category. It was also no secret to figure that Shuri was going to take up the mantle and the film handles that gracefully.Angela Bassett turns in a stellar performance. She gives it her all in this film, holding Wakanda together. Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o also provide sharp roles within the plot and Winston Duke does provide some humor when necessary.The need to introduce Dominique Thorn's Iron Heart, I felt was an unnecessary one. To me she was the only element in the film that dragged it down a notch. She's caught in the conflict as she's indirectly responsible for the tension between Wakanda and Talokan by creating a machine that can detect vibranium. I felt there could have been a better way to start a conflict between both nations that didn't need to incorporate Riri Willaims in the mix. I think cutting the character could have allowed the film to be paced better so we don't feel the length.The breakout for me is Tenoch Huerta Mejia as Namor. Namor's film rights (along with Hulk) has been with Universal for a long time and he's finally getting his due. Coogler and his team take liberties on the character as he's not as well known despite being Marvel's first character on page. I welcomed the change and thought it to be creative and clever to incorporate Mayan heritage to his kind. In true with the comics, Namor is perceived as an anti-hero but he has his reasons due to his commitment to his people. Namor's got fun action scenes and as a comics fan it made me so happy to see his wings on his feet. The acknowledgement that he is a mutant is also a cherry on top. He's charming, a bit of an asshole, and just incredibly powerful. If the goal was to also make him different than WB/DC's Aquaman, mission accomplished. Fun fact, Namor was also conceived on page before Aquaman too.Great score once again from Ludwig GÃ¶ransson and the film also had some decent VFX shots. Not all were perfect, but they looked more polished than most other MCU projects lately.Among Phase 4, this and SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME are the clear champions that salvage the somewhat mediocre phase.Now I personally think the first BLACK PANTHER is a solid entry, BUT I do not think it is one of the best superhero films ever made. HOWEVER its success, phenomenon, and cultural impact cannot be ignored and a great deal of that came from not just Marvel Studios, but from Chadwick Boseman. The film tributes him in a beautiful way as his presence is felt and missed simultaneously. Because of that it almost felt like I was going to a concert, but without the lead singer. That just ties into what I wrote earlier, Coogler had an impossible task due to such unfortunate circumstances, and to still make a good follow-up is a testament to his abilities.8/10."
9," A sequel worth watching!
",bryvill,/user/ur127614756/,11 November 2022,"I was curious and excited at the same time, how will the sequel goes after our respected late actor Chadwick Bozeman absence, but after seeing it, as the title of my review goes,"" A sequel worth watching!"" As expected, lots of actions and adventure continues, what I like most is they injected a lot of genuine comedy that will make you laugh out loud literally! The drama presented was top notch and will make you cry like a baby.. (guess no need to explain further). It has an element of horror and suspense as well that feels creepy at times. So again, from action to adventure to horror to comedy and drama, they've got it all!"
5," Not any better than recent marvel movies...
",webpost-72512,/user/ur158704219/,11 November 2022,"Story is not really interesting and movie itself is really slow, Namor actor played his character very well and other also did fine...this movie is not better than the first black panther movie and it's predictable if you've watched the movie trailers and promos and they already showed all the action in the trailer they showed us what we saw in the trailers, I didn't enjoy this movie it was boring.. alot of things done by the wakandin people shown the movie look forced as if they are trying to make things worse idk but ironheart's character Riri wileims played a character who is supposed to be a genius but she is careless and responsible for what happened in the movie. Im just very disappoint that marvel movies are now all about characters creating problems for themselves and others and they are not even villains, upcoming movie antman is also about caise langs mistake good luck with the weak plot base.."

",sirmohittomar,/user/ur94201019/,11 November 2022,"Dear marvel.. well i can understand aftr losing Chadwick, we need something to build this up again..But I feel u miss a better and intensed fight scene between black panther and namor in d end.Using technology and dried him up was a great move,
But I guess real treat is always a intensed fight scene between superhero.Apart from showing namor targeting helicopters and all,
There's nothing there..Except that punch namor hit mbaku, there u can see the real glimpse of his power..Story and everything is going great and nice..
Shuri is doing well..
Nakia is doing well...
Ramanda okoye all played well..After endgame, Marvel lacking in intensed fight scenes except Spiderman.."
4," Watered down! Pun intended!
",cbread208,/user/ur56640674/,11 November 2022,"The movie was all over the place. The action sequences were okay but there really wasn't any character development. The movie was just rushed from scene to scene and also there weren't really any funny scenes which isn't typical for Black panther movie franchise. There were some sequences that will probably make it a sequel. But time will tell. If you going to the movie and don't think about it too hard, it will be okay. Just disconnect your brain as it were. You might actually enjoy the movie. And the previews, wow the previews, were about 20 to 25 minutes!!! Then the movie was about 2 hours and 40 minutes."
2," Disappointment in every aspects
",siminhaque,/user/ur154402275/,11 November 2022,"We understand that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever won't be the same as what it used to carry but still thinking of some flashy action scenes or a few mesmerizing displays of characters which the movie failed to do so.__
The movie felt like more or less a family drama with no strong plot for why the agony started in the first place. So if you want to see people just being emotional while wearing costumes, this movie is just for you._
Also if you are expecting some interesting turns of events that will disappoint you also. The movie goes in the usual MCU ways and does not significantly represent the way a Black Panther movie should be.__
So if you have seen the trailer, you already have seen the whole movie and would find nothing new."
10," A heartbreaking and beautiful tribute to a king
",maceman1220,/user/ur56475557/,11 November 2022,"On it's own, this film is a great addition to the MCU and a very entertaining film, but as a tribute to Chadwick Boseman, it's heartbreaking, beautiful, and gonna stay with me for a long time.Without going into detail, the film honors the man in such perfect ways. They made the story feel as organic as it could on addressing his passing, and though he isn't there, his spirit is felt through the entire experience. It's one of the greatest tributes I could possibly imagine and it had me in tears more than once.Outside of all that, it's an incredibly fun ride. The entire cast crushes it, and I loved the focus on the women of Wakanda. Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, they carry the film beautifully. Tenoch Huerta as Namor is fantastic, one of my favorite MCU villains. His character is very well rounded and he feels quite genuine, as well as being an absolute savage.The film isn't perfect, there's maybe one or two sub plots that didn't fit quite as well, a few characters who were a bit superfluous on some levels, but that all feels moot compared to the emotional weight the film carries, and the reverence it has for it's fallen king. I was silent as I left the theater, reflecting on a film made much deeper by a real life tragedy, and how delicately and gracefully they handled it. Rest in peace Chadwick, and Wakanda Forever!"
8," In Ryan Coogler We Trust
",fatirx,/user/ur152622026/,11 November 2022,"I love this movie. Such a beautiful tribute for Chadwick. Wakanda Forever literally save MCU phase 4 and become best closing of phase 4. Story is amazing, costume design is a chef kiss. And also Namor steals the show, I don't have a high expectations about Namor, but it in this movie Tenoch Huerta plays Namor incredibly. Some of the scene kinda actually boring but overall I really enjoy this movie. I love how the studios change the origin of Namor , this good decision make BP 2 become rich of culture. We can see the beautiful race between Wakanda and Talocan. I hope in the next Phase MCU focusing on writing their movie instead of fanservice."
8," How did they pull it off?
",FeastMode,/user/ur104603847/,11 November 2022,"The passing of Chadwick Boseman is so sad. Condolences to his family.From the much less important perspective of a movie fan, I thought he was a perfect casting choice for the role. He brought a likeability that had you constantly rooting for him. Always on his side. Makes you want to say, ""I'm with you til the end of the line."" I'll forever wonder what could have been with him helming this franchise. And I had no idea what could be done to save it.The easy answer: just make a great movie. A movie that hits on every aspect, fires on all cylinders. Of course we need a bunch of cool action scenes. Include some clear fight scenes without shaky cam. Add a fantastic musical score and bring it to the forefront (MCU is learning!). Throw in some beautiful cinematography......You already have a bunch of awesome characters played by a great cast, so show off those acting skills (and wow, they really do). Then introduce a BEASTLY villain. And don't skimp on his development (important!)......And the cherry on top? Don't do the typical ""insert joke here"" that the MCU has had a problem with for a while. Have specific scenes for comedy, at the right moments. And allow the serious stuff to be serious. Let us feel it without undercutting it.I'm so impressed with how they pulled this off. The route they took is significantly better than what I assumed they would do. But it's all about execution. Any movie can be good if done right. After the disappointing Thor 4, this is a huge bounce-back. (3 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 11/10/2022, IMAX 11/21/2022, IMAX 12/14/2022)"
9," At the end of the day, a spectacular and impactful ride, pulsating with numerous emotional bits.
",valmont1702,/user/ur41094987/,11 November 2022,"There's one hour / one hour and a half introducing various things, fairly interesting and nicely made, even if it might feel a little long at some point for some people... There are several majestic things here and there (settings, costumes and overall photography radiate poetry and sheer beauty), but the movie really and definitely takes off for good when it reaches its half, then it becomes extremely catchy pretty much all the time and intense in-depth... Undoubtedly mesmerizing ; emotionally, visually-wise and action-wise of course.Gorgeous/Stunning visuals all along (even breathtaking at times), the music, the adventure as a whole, and the new characters introduced are all true strengths of the movie (alongside with the mind-blowing costume design which might very much be a no-brainer upcoming Oscar winner)...Most definitely a slow burn (for story/lore and characters development's sake) with elongated storylines/scenes in the first half (aside from a couple of scenes), but in fact it plants many seeds and it very well pays off down the line... You are invested with pretty much every important character, which is a nice feeling obviously. And yes, again, the second half of the movie is a pure blast, in particular the last hour which is masterfully orchestrated and shines high-in-color before our very eyes !In the end, it leaves you a very pleasant taste. A deep pleasure it is to spend time in Wakanda and Talocan, and with these truly charismatic and interesting/layered characters."
8," It's a good movie
",MatthewMichaelHoffman,/user/ur152799620/,11 November 2022,"SCORE: 8.4/10I have so many thoughts that are completely blockaded by the fact that Chadwick Boseman was not returning to play Black Panther in this movie. It became very clear to me within the first 15 minutes of the film that there really wasn't a perfect way to go about handling his passing. The movie was a wonderful tribute, but you could still feel like something was off the entire time. However, Ryan Coogler was faced with an impossible task and was able to make the most of it and make his best attempt to move forward with the story and I'd say he did a pretty damn good job.If a MCU movie was going to break the mood of a typical Marvel movie, this one had every right to do it. Not a bunch of cameos, not a bunch of callbacks to previous projects, not a bunch of build up to future projects, but instead a beautifully written story about overcoming great loss. The entire cast and crew killed it, but Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira, and Angela Bassett were something special. I also loved the introduction of Iron Heart and feel like her and Spider-Man would get along so well with their matching energy. This movie really kicked off when Namor showed up to Wakanda for the first time, including the humor which was looking to be going in a bad direction at the start of the film. By the end, there was definitely better humor than in the first film. Speaking of Namor, what an amazing villain. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed that they didn't bring in the connection to Dr. Doom, but Namor alone was enough to be the main threat throughout the film.Now for the bad. There was definitely points where the humor/serious combo was not executed well, the plot did feel a bit all over the place, and it stayed pretty level set from start to finish, not really going too far outside of the comfort zone. The story was still beautiful, but I didn't find myself on the edge of my seat like I have been with other projects or super excited about what was going to happen next. I truly just sat back, took it all in, and left feeling like they did a good job. It's a good movie."
6," Eeep sorry
",mspiggi,/user/ur88292116/,11 November 2022,"Loved the theme of loss and coming of age. This movie hinted at great story without getting there. Maybe it takes place in a different universe?What is deeply missing besides a loved actor is soundtrack.With the first movie punctuated with music and sound and energy this movie is like watching the tv on subtitles only.Someone will love it the way I loved the 1st black panther.Someone will strongly dislike it like how I disliked the the crazy Star wars where kylo ren is shirtless in high waisted gauchos.I loved the introduction of the ""enemy"" so much good history to delve into. Unfortunately, with almost no real tie in to the franchise it makes the story nearly unbelievable."
10," Powerful and Emotional
",aaronlong-60751,/user/ur156041129/,11 November 2022,"(First IMDB Movie Review) Black Panther: Wakanda Forever - Probably the most emotional Marvel movie to date and it did it so well. I cried five times in this movie and I haven't cried that much in a while. The themes in this movie of grief, revenge, legacy, and family were astounding and handled very well. Letitia Wright was phenomenal in this movie and brought so much emotion and force to the character of Shuri. The Dora Milaje were badass and exceptional at fighting as usual. Dominique Thorne did a fabulous job introducing us to the new energetic character that is Riri Williams. However, the main standout acting came Angela Bassett as the passionate, powerful, and moving Queen Ramonda; she stole almost every scene she was in with an electric presence. The main strength of this movie for me was the way they handled Chadwick Boseman's passing and the amazing amount of respect they gave him and his character of T'Challa. Now, getting into the more technical stuff the cinematography was incredible along with the costume design and soundtrack. The CGI was really well done and only had a few slight moments where I noticed problems. All in all, this was a great film and is now my favorite film of Phase 4 well making my top 10 in the MCU as a whole. I definitely recommend seeing this in theatres if you can, I know that I'm going to be making more trips back to see it a few more times. All I have to say now is - Rest in Peace Chadwick... your legacy will always be with us."
5," It fails to surprise.
",jp_91,/user/ur21881328/,11 November 2022,"""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is a movie with a more mature theme than many others in the Marvel Universe, touching on the theme of emotional loss and overcoming it, although jokes and incompetent dialogue are also added that break that maturity narrative in a wrong way. The script draws on the history of Wakanda from an African perspective as seen before and adds the world of Namor with a Mexican perspective from its Mayan period, mixing mythology and futuristic fictional technology in a successful way. The evolution of Shuri's character is deep and the introduction of Namor's character is interesting, but the script is not exempt from being repetitive and making the film unnecessarily long. The CGI special effects feature elements that are well done and others that look quite fake. The editing work is very good and emphasizes the central theme already mentioned above, the loss of a loved one. The cinematography is excellent in the underwater scenes, but in the scenes above the water it becomes ordinary. Letitia Wright's performance is powerful, while Tenoch Huerta proves to be a good actor and Lupita Nyong'o fails to fully convince her character. A film with some remarkable technical elements, but a script that takes a good theme and overflows until it becomes tiresome."
9," King T'Challa & Wakanda Forever!
",twhy_k,/user/ur35033667/,11 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is not a second Black Panther. People must go into this film not expecting a part two, but a transitional story. The wonderful Chadwick Boseman has passed. Our hearts still break for both Chadwick and our beloved King T'Challa.This film at it's core is about grief, loss, legacy, and hope, tributing to Chadwick and his character. It's slowly paced for a reason. It's intimate and personal in a way that is very emotional, which each character shines.The plot is engaging, visuals are beautiful, costumes are fantstic, and the action when it counts is great. Ryan Coogler does justice for this recovery sequel, while still giving the iconic sound and themes of Wakanda.Wakanda Forever!"
7," Wakanda Forever was an earnest film that tackled some tough themes and honored its hero well but got bogged down introducing vast new worlds and complicated characters.
",Paragon240,/user/ur27557228/,11 November 2022,"Wakanda Forever left me with mixed emotions. The respect and love paid to the legacy of Chadwick Boseman were heartfelt, meaningful, and sincere. The movie wisely grappled with the aftermath of T'Challa's passing on his family and nation. This subject matter created excellent opportunities to dive deeper into characters like Shuri, Nakia, and even M'Baku. Instead, Wakanda Forever primarily served as a vehicle to introduce Namor and Talokan. The film rightfully embraced a more somber tone as it dealt with themes of loss and legacy, but the mournful spirit caused the plot to sag and drag along throughout most of the runtime. Winston Duke offers the little levity the movie had. The cast delivered exceptionally, with Angela Bassett's performance as the true standout. I liked the movie, but the melancholy approach made it more difficult to really enjoy, and the introduction of Namor and his threat to Wakanda chewed up so much of the story that it was difficult to bring closure to characters struggling with loss and heartbreak satisfyingly."
7," A solid enough sendoff to a pretty lackluster phase.
",pap-05900,/user/ur157032052/,11 November 2022,"BP 2 is what I expected it to be. A tribute of sorts to the late Chadwick Boseman. And the characters in the story have suffered a similar loss of Tchalla. So you instantly connect and relate to the characters. And the movie is great when it focuses on that grief. Letitia Wright and Angela Basset are great at portraying that loss masterfully with perhaps the best performance from Angela Basset in comic book medium this year.Anyone who kept up with Chadwick's work will get instantly teary eyed the moment that 1st scene opens. But if you have no such history and only wanted to watch a fun superhero movie.. This will probably not be for you. It has that MCU humor sometimes and sparse action sprinkled in but they never exceed their welcome. So younger audience might even find this movie kind of boring.The film also seems to not know when to end or which character to focus on. Especially during the 2nd act where the lack of a main character is felt the most. There is also a weird subplot with Martin Freeman which just feels like Marvel going ""hey check out his cool thing that MIGHT happen next in the MCU"" which I felt wasn't really needed along with like 20 or so minutes towards the end.Cons aside, the film is still pretty good. The action is pretty on point, VFX is definitely better than the 1st one most of the time and the performances are extremely great and effective. A great watch for anyone who keeps up with the MCU. And I would certainly recommend it. I still think Batman is the best comic movie this year but BP2 certainly comes close.Overall still a pretty solid movie."

",gabethedinosaur,/user/ur33283012/,11 November 2022,"I'll never forget the first time Chadwick was black panther in civil war , black panther 2018 avengers infinity war 2018 and avengers endgame 2019 . After Chadwick boseman died 2 years ago during the pandemic he wanted marvel studios to continue the movie to Honor his name . And I say that's a very sweet thing for Chadwick. The opening was so sad and heartbreaking when the black panther died and I felt so sad. But I'll never forget the first time the black panther fighted during civil war , fighting his cousin for wakanda , infinity war and the snap when thanos snapped his fingers , and came back 2019 to finish 2014 thanos . I want to see black panther again after strange world hits theaters. Black panther will be a bigger box office success than avatar ways of water cause fans are gonna say black panther leads the way of wakanda . Blue people don't do that .Black panther rules the box office

(It's so cool to see the return of Michael B. Jordan replies as Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens.) And I loved the new characters in the movie and the original characters from the 2018 film. The visual effects is marvelous and the sound effects are awesome and the music was impressive...."
6," Not the masterpiece we were promised
",lamashtar,/user/ur65780331/,11 November 2022,"The acting is great. The queen and the villain were riveting. Letitia Wright did a good job but she lacked the charisma of a superhero or supervillain. I wouldn't go see a movie based on her character here.The plot is a bit silly. The rework of the villain was good but felt halfbaked. You might as well be watching Morbius as far as the logic went. The motivation for the conflict made no sense.The action was lackluster. The drama wasn't interesting enough, if that were the reason to watch. The grief tributes were well done but the movie gives too much time to too many people, losing focus and dragging badly.The worst was the introduced kid scientist character. She feels pointless and annoying but is EXACTLY like Iron Man despite no connection whatever. Her ""humor"" was cringey. There is nothing particularly interesting about her. She should have been given her own origin story, then her appearance here would have the energy of a crossover.The new costumes for side characters are awful.I thought the tone of this film similar to Eternals, but Eternals did it better. Deeply missing the Marvel formula. Yes, recent shows rushed their films pacing and muddled plots, but were fun to watch still. This isn't something I'd rewatch."
9," Visually Stunning and Emotional
",dsouzam-92984,/user/ur151960289/,11 November 2022,"Wow! I just got back from seeing Black Panther: Wakanda Forever a few hours ago and I can confidently say that it's EASILY the best Marvel Phase 4 film. Emotional, Visually Stunning, and Action Packed. I actually prefer it to the first film, but I know that's a hot take. The action sequences were great and surprisingly a lot was hidden from the us. The ending battle was awesome and the chemistry between the characters was perfect. I think going into this movie, don't expect much and you will be pleased. My only qualm would be that it's a little long, but other than that, it was great. Definitely recommend it!"
6," Emotional but Unnecessary
",cbrueggemeyer,/user/ur25506168/,11 November 2022,"Overall I thought the film was emotional and showed flashes of brilliance, but it ran too long and failed to make an impact on the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole.I am by no means a huge Marvel fan, but it seems like every film or show in this phase has nothing to do with the grand scene of things. This film, the new Thor film, and the new Doctor Strange film all provided a somewhat entertaining 2+ hours but all basically failed to connect to the overall ""plan"" of the MCU, other than showcasing a new character or giving us a cameo from a B list Marvel celebrity.I think it is a bit arrogant that Marvel continues to lean on its superior special effects, forsaking plot and character development to create the film equivalent of one-and-done roller coaster rides. They market the hell out of these movies and get everyone excited for the new chapter of an established character's journey, only to establish new characters without connecting their stories back to the MCU. Obviously, they are going to continue doing this because of the money, but it would be nice to give the fans a semblance of a vision, rather than making us tune in for a new adventure from one of 30 newly-established characters.This movie was more emotional than most Marvel movies because of the passing of Chadwick Boseman, but overall I thought it was a bit long and a bit unconvincing (other than a great performance from Angela Basset). I think the bottom line is that if you want, you can skip this movie and not feel bad about being out of the loop for future Marvel projects."
7," So much water
",reubent-71726,/user/ur113876709/,11 November 2022,"Warning this review has a lot of spoilers.Pretty good addition to the marvel franchise. No big surprise that Shuri becomes Black Panther, as that is given in the trailer. However, another pretty big spoiler is that Namor is actually a good guy in the comics, so when you break down this movie, you realize it's just one giant miscommunication between two nations. It's pretty obvious each is trying to protect their own people, and though the conflict initially centers around one person, revenge consumes and escalates something that could have been handled with diplomacy. It's pretty amazing the technology that Wakanda develops, such as force fields and weapons that can slice through solid matter but then be capable of stunning people. Going beyond that, 3d printing the flower with magical properties is well beyond even science fiction universes like Star Wars. No one in the Star Wars universe possess the intellect seen in the MCU. We are introduced to two new Iron Man type suits. No time span was given, but I'm pretty sure they were engineered within a couple hours. We may have stagnated in our scientific revolution in this century, but the imagination of what the future holds is limitless. This was a pretty long film, but very enjoyable and a proper tribute to Chadwick Boseman."

A negative thing of these movie is length of movie is so long but the movie is superb and talk about visual effects are very amazing beautiful shots and actions are so realistic at last climax is mind-blowing and post credit sence is very imotional andd Marvel's best phase 4 movie.

It's my favorite since End Game and a fitting close to Phase 4.I don't want to give anything away but let's just say that I had a lot of feels this time around. There was also plenty of action to warrant watching on the big screen.The casting of Namor was fantastic. Looking forward to seeing more of him in future movies. I LOVE the diversity of the cast as well.My only regret was watching the trailers - I think too much of the plot was given away. Why do you do this Marvel??Definitely worth watching on the big screen."

",kitingaomotoso,/user/ur136239546/,11 November 2022,"This is with no doubt one of the best marvel movies this year and a great way to end phase 4 which has been a terrible and trash phase. This movie had everything emotion, Action and a serious tone and to my surprise this movie was actually funny. What the movie felt a beat rushed we did not really have time to dive all know some other characters in this movie. Umbaku was sideline and I really wanted more of him. One of the best performances of this movie goes to Namor and Queen Ramonda. Movie almost met my expectations but like I said again it's a solid movie 8.5/10.

7," Good performances but..
",knoxgomez,/user/ur154793294/,11 November 2022,"Very good performances, effects, and especially a good tribute to the late Chadwick :( aside from that the comedy in the movie is something that I dislike, having sold it as something serious in trailers and commercials, marvel to this day he doesn't know how to handle humor, he's very bad. Another point is, Namor's powers, and those wings on his feet? Atuma is really so weak? The change in the character's history bothered me, did they make him Mexican? Right?, they could have made the story more similar to the comics, which is quite similar to the one in the aquaman movie, and that pleased me. And Atlantis? Another unsolved mystery. I think that the most remarkable thing by far in the movie is the soundtrack, a masterpiece like its predecessor."
," If I speak, I'm in big trouble
",buddynort05,/user/ur44676124/,11 November 2022,"I guess to start this review the main issue for me was the pacing. The movie was way too long and you could definitely feel it in the second act. A little bit too much of backstory/going over the villain's history took me out of it for awhile. Final act did a decent job at getting you excited with the new suits however the main characters changing their mind or changing their ways very quickly didn't seem natural and something they would do. Okoye was great just like the first movie, letitia and angela bassett were good too, however the motives of the main characters get thrown out the window so fast it didn't make sense to me. And shuri should be dead?? Whatever. Sorry mr. Coogler, this was a miss. An overbloated, sometimes boring movie is surprising after you allegedly threw out the script once Chadwick died."
7," ""In my culture, Death is not the end""-T'Challa
",pughspencer,/user/ur154514328/,11 November 2022,"With the passing of Chadwick Boseman in 2020 & the decision to not recast T'Challa, continuing on with a sequel just didn't seem right. But somehow director Ryan Coogler managed to overcome the Impossible by crafting a solid follow-up thanks in part to it's stellar cast.Right from the get-go we watch as the nation of wakanda is mourning the loss of its king. Grief plays a strong role in the story and we see how T'Challa's death impacts everyone he knew closely. From a mother, to a sister, to a lover, and even a rival turned friend. T'Challa's spirit no doubt hovers over this film & makes for some emotional and heartfelt moments. I cant imagine the difficult task going from supporting to main focus that Letitia Wright had to go up against. But she wonderfully plays Shuri again this time as not just a funny sidekick but now a righteous fighter struggling to carry her family's Legacy forward. It may be hard to see her as the new forefront of the franchise right now but only time will tell if it sticks. The standout performance was no doubt Angela Bassett as Queen Ramonda. You really believe this woman lost her son where it's hard to tell if she's grieving for T'Challa, or Boseman, or even both. All the Supporting Cast do excellent jobs growing as their characters and the addition of Dominique Thorne's Riri Williams/Ironheart makes for a very appealing new face to the MCU. Among this great tragedy is the coming of an underwater tribe called the Talokan led by the dominating Namor. Although he may not be as compelling as Eric killmonger from the last film he makes for a solid antagonist that's both ruthless and sympathetic.The movie has its hiccups. For the first 2 acts the movie feels like it really struggles to find its main character. Shuri seems to be made out as the lead but she goes in and out through the story and doesn't become much of the focus until the third act. Also while most the supporting cast worked for me the subplot with Martin Freeman's Agent Ross didn't seem to serve much purpose and couldve easily saved the movie's bloated runtime an extra 20 minutes.Black Panther Wakanda Forever was never gonna be as impactful as its first outing. But thanks to a strong cast, beautifully crafted visuals, fun action sequences, and of course the emotional weight of our lost hero, it makes for a worthy follow up that worked better than It had any right to."
10," The Black Panther Lives!
",rhythmansane,/user/ur46483492/,11 November 2022,"To say this was a difficult sequel to make would surely be one of the greatest understatement from the MCU. Fortunately, thanks to the great mind of Ryan Coogler and the wonderful cast & crew of this movie, Wakanda Forever is a beautiful dedication to our friend Chadwick Bosewick.Every scene is gripping, emotional and mesmerizing. The anamorphic lense used in filming gives you a peaceful impression that each scene was filmed in honor and memory of Chadwick. You may find yourself holding back tears many times throughout the movie.The runtime of almost 3 hours goes by much quicker than you would expect as you are immersed into many beautiful environments including never-before-seen locations. AVX and DBOX amplified the experience even more than I was expecting, so I recommend watching it in the most immersive format possible. There were also more underwater scenes than I was expecting. As a fan of Avatar, this just got me even more excited for The Way of Water.Whether you are a die hard comic geek or a simple fan of MCU movies and shows, Wakanda Forever will leave you satisfied. It might even make you want more. Does the promotion materials and trailer make it obvious as to who is to become the next Black Panther? Perhaps, however how they end up taking the mantle and what they do with it will define what will happen to them, Wakanda and the rest of the world."
8," THE CINEMATIC STUFF
",kiranshadharmendran,/user/ur58703152/,11 November 2022,"Usually, Marvel movies have the template movie-making style and we have been watching the same stuff for the past few years but this one is entirely different from those. From beginning to end the movie carries different emotions, strength, vengeance, and power, everything is packed in a perfect commercial package especially the placement of background scores and songs gave lots of goosebumps. It is not about comparing with the 2018 movie, this is different. I always believe that whatever actors are there, whatever budget they have the movie needs to be designed properly which is called direction. Within 30 minutes Ryan Coogler dragged me into his cinematic world."
9," Different but amazing
",AriB824,/user/ur82930291/,11 November 2022,I have to commend marvel and Disney for how they handled Chadwick's passing in this movie how Ryan Wrote every word was truly heart wrenching!! The acting is incredible which is to be expected with the caliber of actors and actresses that are in this film. It doesn't compare to the first because of the simple fact that Chadwick has passed.. so there's a dark cloud over the movie in a sense... but it takes nothing away and just makes the story even better!! It was definitely worth the wait!It's not a 10 for me because The runtime is a bit long and I was lacking a little action ( these woman are Fierce warriors wide am I only getting one true fight scene).but that's being nitpicky.
2," Disappointment after the first Black Panther
",elywolf,/user/ur36622173/,11 November 2022,"I really wanted to like this movie. The first one was so good. Unfortunately I found it incredibly slow. Most of the characters lacked the charisma of Mr Bozeman, and struggled to carry the movie. Namor was an ok character, but his acting felt flat. The movie lacked a lot of the action and thrills that you would expect from a Marvel movie, and the fun time felt about 20 minutes too long. Angela Basset played her character very well, and did bring a sense of gravitas to the movie. Hopefully, if any are given, she will receive a nomination for her part.It does feel that Marvel is aiming at a younger audience, bringing in Iron Heart and other similar characters. I'm not sure they are able to hold the more mature audiences attention overall."

",mavinizhon,/user/ur71565462/,11 November 2022,"I seriously don't know how anyone given this movie a 1. If I'm being honest the movie is actually rated 8.5/10.Almost a perfect movie, the movie found away to pay tribute to chad which out it being to forced.The set up was a little shaky the season for the war on wakanda namor blames wakanada for introducing the world to their share material.But namor is way store and his kingdom isn't going to get intruders. Because the layout would kill any one with out their mutation.I really think namor was bullying wakanda, also the ending also strange because they put so much skill in out smarting him. Makes wakanda a target it's not like they out strength namor. If bast gave them her power maybe it'll been more believable. Hope the new heir we'll redeem wakanda."
9," A great send off and a great beginning
",edler_c,/user/ur151444663/,11 November 2022,"Disney/Marvel please give us more of this! It was a return to form and better! The characters were real and grounded. There was actual emotion from the actors/actresses/characters and throughout the movie as a whole. A laugh here or there, PERFECTLY BALANCED (as all things should be). As someone who recently lost a loved one, the movie hit me in the feels hard, something I've come to not expect from a Disney/Marvel production. I mean seriously loved this movie. I also find it admirable how respectful the production was towards Mr. Boseman. I'm also glad they did not over play Ironman through Riri Williams. Of course there's always something to nitpick but they were completely overshadowed in my opinion. Someone please give Ms. Bassett a damn crown, she was a jewel in this film! I will 100% see this again!"
5," Disjointed
",daisukereds,/user/ur26579233/,11 November 2022,"There are too many problems with Wakanda Forever.From a slow pacing and momentum-halting scenes, to strange character arcs (or lack of by the end), strange interactions and lacking dialogues, to a development below the expected scale of this specific sequel.Doesn't help that we got some great and promising trailers!Still, underneath the film that was delivered, there are a lot of things that can be appreciated and would have made a great story! Makes you wonder what the forced changes, due to unexpected situations, made to the script! But there are still things to enjoy like the character of Namor, who has a great introduction and background as well as look (yet feels underdeveloped as it concludes, like Atlantis itself). Some of the emotional tones and character challenges, if steered in a different direction, would have given more weight to the plot. The music and sound mixing are great, as well as general design of clothing and structures.Sadly, I found myself disappointed and bored throughout. With forgettable action and set-pieces, constant sequences that take you out of the movie by generating questions on ""why things aren't done differently"" and a dull ending. Can't really recommend it, and that makes sad. Wait for it on streaming."
9," I almost forgot i watching a super hero movie
",azukqiu,/user/ur79540458/,11 November 2022,"WellI expect this to be an emotional movie but not to this level.The cast is incredible you can feel the emotion on all the characters played by them in the movie.The feel of loss, pain, hate in Shuri.The feel of motherly pain, a great queen charisma in Ramonda
The feel of protective King in Namorand many more. I can sense it all. The characters story is build neatly in the film, and combine it with the action which is nicely choreographed, a nice cinematography, with a great sound and music, you get a great and nice balance movie and truly enjoyable for MCU fan like myself.For a truly enjoyable experience Just watch, don't overthink and question everything."
1," Yikes...not good
",zzzxxxcccvvv-43202,/user/ur88302291/,11 November 2022,"Wow this movie is a complete disaster. I don't even know where to start. TLDR do not give these people your money.The movie runtime is 2 hours too long. You will be bored start to finish. It has no substance at all. In the previous movie you actually wanted to know what was going to happen, but this movie is the exact opposite. It starts nowhere and ends nowhere. So much unnecessary dialogue that slows the show to a crawl.Every character is annoying and unlikable. I hate to say this but this franchise is done. NONE of these characters can carry another movie. You won't care what happens because these aren't people you're supposed to care about.CGI is below average. Action scenes are pathetic. Way too much depressing drama. I can't imagine anyone leaving the theater thinking this was a good movie."
1," I'm so disappointed
",RK00,/user/ur45920219/,11 November 2022,"I am honestly disappointed with what I just watched. The first black panther film moved the world but this sequel sucked.There's a whole arc in this film that literally exists to set up future projects and honestly would have been a much better film without this. Like how can they have the audacity to do this with the most important MCU film since endgame, it's a slap in the face. And on top of that the character in question was terrible (not too surprising considering original iron heart comic was also terrible).All I've been hearing about this film is how it go it's Chadwicks legacy, I may be wrong her and people can take what they saw differently to me but where was all this? A quick death/write off in the beginning and ok a good looking funeral then it's one year later and goodbuy T'Challa. I think they seriously messed this up, T'Challa is arguably the most important MCU character since Iron Man and that's what they give him? I mourned the loss of Chadwick like we all did but I just felt that the character was done serious injustice here. Should've definitely been recast , they underestimated how much the character means to the world (ours and MCU).Namor was the only saving grace for me, but sorry what was that ending? Made him look so weak. I hated how ironheart just figured out his weakness and it was thrown off because of how intelligent she is, really awful.I wish I could sit down with Ryan Coogler and pick his brain about what went on here. I know it was always going to be difficult but I felt like there could've been so much more done with this film."
10," Powerful film in every sense of the word
",gary-hooper-221-718723,/user/ur58162670/,11 November 2022,"Going to keep this brief as to not spoil anything. The movie displayed every sense of power a human can express. Action, emotion, conviction, and more. It got to me almost immediately, the point I hope anyone who reads this, and will take with them to see the movie, is the understanding of the actors in this film were not acting, for the most part. The loss of their working partner and friend, Chadwick Boseman was clearly real and had a big effect on this movie. They paid true respect to the actor, and the character, and the message inside both of their hearts. I saw that right away and it took the whole thing to another level. Action, acting, set design, top notch. Go and enjoy!"
7," For Honor, For Legacy, For Wakanda!
",AfricanBro,/user/ur120413622/,11 November 2022,"The first black panther was mostly focused on Wakandan affairs, this one really expands that but despite the wider scope it is one of the most intimate movies in the MCU so far. Less action and more about honoring Black Panther's death, if felt more real considering Chadwick himself passed; it was also more political handling the passing of power and as I did my best to avoid spoilers and teaser trailers, I've found out the big secret was already revealed in a leak. I'll try avoiding the spoilers.As said earlier, this one doesn't not only like focus on wakanda, it widens it's scope to the whole world. It increases the stakes, making it seem like an elaborate plot scheme. I loved that it was evenly matched throughout, Wakanda seemed to have better tech but Talocans seemed to be stronger fighters.Namor had a really cool, mysterious intro. M'baku was hilarious, the movie was generally quite comedic for the first half but unlike other recent marvel movies it fortunately wasn't forced humor. Action felt seldom especially considering the runtime, but after watching the first black panther just before they were better. It's slow paced so this isn't as blood rushing as other marvel movies, don't expect constant tension or fights. Everyone was as good as you'd expect but Angela Bassett gave an amazing performance and stood out. As was the first movie, I still feel like Andy Serkis is an underrated perfect casting.Opening scene honors T'challa and opening credits for Chadwick, it's continued throughout. It had flashbacks and tributes that made the movie more of a farewell to both, everything seemed secondary.I watched this as a double feature with the first back to back and Wakanda Forever is better. I didn't really have high expectations as a lot of Phase 4 productions have disappointed me, and some of the projects that I actually liked were met with criticisms.End Game carried a lot of emotions a closure to Phase three, this has to be the most devotedly emotional in depth marvel movie, not because of the fan love but because it was written that way. Might not be the best at it but for a superhero movie it was. It was a great way to honor Chadwick and a good movie, I however didn't get that feeling leaving the cinema like I had just seen something special. You know, the way you felt after endgame, even though that's a high bar. The movie still does an impressive job and difficult task bettering it's prequel without it's beloved star, delivering the most emotional take in the MCU thus far."
8," MEMORABLE
",knyfhddmz,/user/ur130741301/,11 November 2022,"A great movie can not be measured on how good they are only during the time we watch it. But the memories and heartfelt impression once we left the cinema, even days amd years after. This is what happens with Wakanda Forever. Its not a great action superhero movie , but it has a heart that no other superhero movies had, 2 hours and 30 minutes was so beautifully shot and told. Marvels have much better movies than this, but this one left a hearfelt emotions, the screnplay, the actings, are all great. They've provided the perfect ending for T'Challa (and Chadwick Boseman, respectfully). The movie not tryin hard to be dark, not forcing the comedies, not relyin on acton and CGI, its storytelling is the best part of this movie, the way they present heroes and the villains, life and deaths, and political issues, are so naturally good. Its by far one of the best marvel film so far.Chadwick must be proud up there.."
4," mixed feelings...
",theemuhammede,/user/ur63827208/,11 November 2022,"This movie left me with mixed feelings. It served proper dedication to Chadwick Boseman's death, but the story of the Black Panther moving forward lacked continuity.I believe Wakanda Forever did an exceptional job commemorating Chadwick Boseman especially at the beginning and the end of the movie. Then throughout the middle of the movie there were sprinkles of his mention.Moving forward, the mantle of the Black Panther had to be carried. I think Marvel really struggled with this because of how the movie played out. The Black Panther did not appear until two hours into this movie. But things did not pick up after that. If the total screen time of the Black Panther was added together, I would be shocked if it exceeded five minutes.The story was dry for me because of all the unnecessary turns it took. It did things that I believe will get people talking more about that specific scene rather than what it contributed to the movie. Like after Shuri ingested the synthetic glowing heart-shaped herb, she found herself in a more corrupt throne in the ancestral plane. A black panther can be heard behind the throne, and Michael B. Jordan's Killmunger appeared. I felt this was a slap in the face to Shuri's character. Killmunger was trying to corrupt her as she gained the powers of the Black Panther.Marvel could have done better with this."
10," A tribute
",goshamorrell,/user/ur59184301/,11 November 2022,"The center of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever""-the sequel to the hugely popular ""Black Panther,"" and a tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman-is sincere, even if the overall film feels manufactured. It begins with a funeral for the recently deceased King T'Challa. Shuri (Letitia Wright) and Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) are dressed in white, following the black coffin, whose top features a silver emblem of the Black Panther mask and the crossed arms of the Wakanda salute. Their mournful procession, winding through the kingdom, is contrasted with slow-motion tracking shots of dancers jubilantly dancing in memory of their fallen king. After the coffin arrives at a clearing, where it ceremoniously rises to the sky, we cut to an earnest, emotional montage of Boseman as T'Challa. The solemn, aching continuum of images soon forms the ""Marvel Studios"" logo, announcing that this is still a Marvel movie. And ""Wakanda Forever"" is all the worst for it. But writer/director Ryan Coogler and his co-writer Joe Robert Cole don't possess the same kind of freedom with this melancholy sequel. Some limitations aren't within their control, such as the tragic death of Boseman. The hulking script is chock-full of ideas and themes. Rather than fighting their common enemy (white colonists), two kingdoms helmed by people of color are pitted against each other (an idea that never thematically lands), and the film must delve into the cultural pain that still exists from the historical annihilation of Central and South America's Indigenous kingdoms. A major sea battle ensues, new, ropey gadgets are employed, and loose ends are inarticulately tied. Another montage dedicated to Boseman occurs, and while the film is messy, you're relieved that it begins and ends on the right foot. That is, until the saccharine post-credit scene. I'm not sure what Coogler was thinking. He had more weight on him for this movie than any filmmaker deserves. But when this scene occurred, I audibly groaned at what amounts to a weepy, treacly moment that's wholly unnecessary, emotionally manipulative, and partially unearned. It's one of the many instances where ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" might have its heart in the right place but is in the wrong mindset and in the worst space-at the center of a contrived cinematic universe-to mourn on its own terms."
10," A Move on Story
",mdeasanul,/user/ur142405616/,11 November 2022,Congratulations Ryan & all Black Panther casts for your great effort. It's an emotional tribute to Chadwick. We'll miss you every aspect while watching this film. Agnela Baset did wonderful job portraying Queen Ramonda. Her powerfull voice makes me emotional. BGM & Cinematography was overwhelming. This film was a stand up call for Women. Eyes worthing film for everbuddy. Buckle up. There's a lot of goosebumps moment. You can't but clap. Music was accurate. Action was jaw dropping. Everyone in the cinema hall made an standing ovetion for Chad. Hope for the best for next Black Panther.Wakanda Forever âœŠðŸ�¼
6," Good tribute, bad movie
",yonathanzahavibs,/user/ur149583185/,11 November 2022,"I was personally a big fan of the first black panther movie. Everything from the style, the story and the mixture of a future like city blended with African culture was for me a great watching experience.Wakanda forever however, had some great scenes creating the same vibe with the mixture between African and future like cities. The story, the other shown new city, the new character, the plot. All of these are not on the level that I expected from this movie. It was decent, okay even. But this movie did not get me as excited as the first black panther, or the latest dr. Strange in the multiverse of madness."
7," Wakanda Forever!!!!
",alexbazelos,/user/ur151621159/,10 November 2022,"The last movie of 2022 and also of Phase 4 has arrived. A phase that divided i would say Marvel fana. This Black Panther is very different since Chadwick Boseman was absent. I would say that this movie was a challenge for Marvel. Beyond they had to do everything good to honor Chadwick, creating a film without your protagonist who has been loved by the audience all these years, but also to manage the character for the future of the MCU is just as challenging to do. I believe they succeeded to a satisfactory grade Phase 4 ended in a pretty good way.First the movie contains a lot of action. More than all the recent Marvel movies. From the very first scene, while I was waiting for the intro to drop, it starts full force. It immediately draws you into the plot.The effects were very impressive. Ok Marvel has us used to strong CGI (with the exception of some recent projects) and effects but really in this particular movie for me it was awesome as well as the fight scenes.As for the cast. I think the lead Letitia Wright ( Shuri ) had a very difficult task. This particular film was a special case for her. Because she was not called to simply embody Shuri. She had to capture through her role her sadness for the loss of not only her cinematography brother Ta Chala but especially Chadwick and pass it on to the viewer as intensely as possible. He tried to give it his all because it is not about a death of an MCU character but a real death of a loved and very talented actor like Chadwick. Especially when the film is dedicated to him. And I think he responded perfectly, as did the rest of the actors.Finally, regarding the passage of Iron Heart, I personally am waiting for her series very much after her appearance in the film. Namor is an interesting character
The credit scene is very interesting.I'm not saying it's a perfect one. It has some problems but is a very very good marvel movie."
5," Mediocre
",gaarauzumaki_992,/user/ur26989113/,10 November 2022,"Going into this movie I thought that this movie was really going to be ""emotional"" because every other reviewer said so, but it honestly wasn't.Overall it was a rather mediocre movie when it comes to the story. Nothing of importance or interest happens in this installment. The entire plot is mostly pointless.I am not sure how much money went into this one, but I have a feeling that not a lot? This is surely not the Marvel's most expensive movie by far.Another trend that I hate is Marvel movies is that they are all drowning in pointless comedy. I'd be far more into this movie and the story if all the ""funny"" dialogue and scenes were cut out. Maybe then I'd actually feel the ""emotional"" side of this movie."
2," Much better than first BP, a decent Marvel movie but has a lot of flaws
",namob-43673,/user/ur60195330/,10 November 2022,"This is a pretty good movie, and a pretty okay superhero movie. This is coming from someone who thinks the first Black Panther was boring to the point of falling asleep. I think that Marvel has not produced a single good movie in a couple of years, and that all TV shows except for perhaps Ms Marvel have been abysmal failures.This however was on par with Marvel's middle works and this far outshines the first black panther.Not to say this movie does not have many issues. The CGi is still lacking. Marvel used to be the best in the business and if you go back watching the first Iron Man, that computer graphic still holds up today so we know they can do better -- so it highly annoys me that they cannot put in that effort with their latest movies. The female scientific team's sudden scientific solution creating a couple of super-women is very contrived. Speaking of; the over-focus on women is almost bordering on laughable. Everyone is a woman in this movie, except for Namor who also happens to be the best character of the movie... go figure... My final main complaint is the ending, which I am not going to spoil, but again a bit too contrived and a couple of too much moments. I do have a lot of minor complaints too, but nothing that really ruins the movie.With that said Namor is an excellent new character. Just as antagonistic, royal and painfully obnoxious as he is in the comics, although his background story is a bit changed here so a few might complain about that. The acting is great by all involved, and I was definitely not bored. This is mid-tier Marvel and as such I tentatively recommend it.I give the movie a 6/10 and although you can find things to complain about I have to say decent job Marvel, at least this was entertaining...let us hope your slump is now over."

",serenarotaru,/user/ur69201884/,10 November 2022,"Firstly, this movie is amazing. The only thing I did not enjoy (hence the 9) is how they ended up treating Okoye. The rest... Imagery, plot, characters, score - excellent. Could have been 20 mins shorter, but I love the fact they took their time with the characters. Namor was brilliant, from the actor (didn't research him but I definitely will, he is a great actor) to the origin story and assumed name (LOVED THAT) - I honestly hope to see him in future movies or series. The way they treated Chadwick Boseman's death was with love and dignity and it was well received. I loved the silent parts of the movie when they payed tribute to Chadwick on screen and the fact that my theater fellows really felt it, everyone was silent and respectful. It was really touching. A must see!"
7," Finally, a serious/emotional phase 4 movie
",stamv,/user/ur91541876/,10 November 2022,"Very emotional movie. It has the seriousness that Thor Love and Thunder didn't have.The first act is pretty emotional, the second act is good but the third act is a little bit weak. Probably, it should have been a little shorter in duration and editted better. Ryan Coogler did his best under the circumstances.Lettitia Wright and Angela Bassett are excellent. Winston's Duke role is limited. I have mixed feelings about ironheart and I didn't like the Midnight Angel armor of Okoye.I love the different origin of Namor and the Talocans and I would like to see more in the future.It is easily one of the best marvel movies."
5," Mediocre at best...weaker than the original by a lot
",guinden,/user/ur38545439/,10 November 2022,"There is nothing epic about this movie not a single scene fight anything.I haven't even felt much throughout the movie cause it was really slow sometime simply boring and not to mention the fact it was not Talocans who killed someone first it was Wakanda who drew first blood so the moral highground felt fake..Not to mention the last fight where they made Namor look like a weakling while Shuri with pierced through chest still beats him when he is pretty much 50m away from water..Plot armor is strong as usual..Ironheart was boring and also bit mary sue. Remember when Tony made his suit and tried flying the first few times? And failed, and failed and oh yes failed. Don't worry Ironheart instantly flying like she has been doing it for years! :PThe climax of the movie the ""big fight"" between the two nations was simply a joke. What was that supposed to be? 25vs25 on a boat where they trying to climb up? It felt meh. There was not a single epic moment in this movie at all...The only cool moment was first time seeing Shuri as black panther and that's it."
10," My honest review about the movie
",carlospanaiotov,/user/ur149866637/,10 November 2022,"The movie was good! I really liked how they got into Chadwick's character and there relationship with his sister! Really liked how every single actor did the best that they could do and I really liked the visual effects! The sound of Rihanna was perfectly balanced with the ending! I think this is one of the best movies that Marvel ever did and especially I think that Letitia Wright's part was amazing! She did really good ,,vibe"" of the Black Panther! For the first time A WOMAN IS BLACK PANTHER which was amazing! Lupita did an amazing and well balanced performance.Okay I spoiled enough information for you to know that if you're not just a Marvel fan, but also a Chadwick Boseman fan, you just NEED TO WATCH IT ASAP!"
9," Feels like a phase 3 movie but could have been better.
",Fradrates,/user/ur158688530/,10 November 2022,"Gave it a 9 cause it deserves an 8 but there's many idiotic people who might be giving 1s and 2s. Good MCU film, I was skeptical about it but was good, Coogler is one of the best directors for the MCU his staging and camera work is creative enough to have a wide appeal but not too out of the box to scare the masses, also the MASSIVE work to re work the entire film due Chadwick's passing is herculean.Costume design was great, there's also good score specially one ""mermaid - esque"" song and Angela Basset, steals the scenes. Is NOT a perfect film but definetly MUCH better than phase 4 average MCU entries. Love how gray Shuri is in the film, she is more of an antihero. Also they fixed Riri Williams who I didn't like in the comics, I'm curious to watch her show now to expand on her story. The changes of Namor (which I didn't like from the trailers) feel really organic and makes sense. The downsides, they kinda mistreated Okoye and the Dora Millage, the CGI was not polished in certain shots (but incredible in some others) and the 3rd act feels a bit rushed.They managed Chadwick's passing respectfully and paid good homage."
8," Coogler does it again.
",philthegreatone-786-63058,/user/ur23512880/,10 November 2022,This film is a great tribute to Chadwick Boseman. The film starts with the kings funeral. It is a very moving ceremony that is very colourful. Wakanda is at a crossroads without their King. A rival species wants their hands on their vibronium. Angela Bassett is fierce in her role as the Queen she really commands the screen. I love the whole world of Wakanda. Coogler does a great job of bringing you into this world. Making the world believeable and adding emotional depth to the story. I love the costumes production design and the music. Letitah Wright does a great job of taking on the family mantle after her brothers depth. Her arc in the film is a great one. Coogler has pulled off a great acheivement after the sad death of Boseman. He continues to build on a fantastic world. I hope i see more of Wakanda in the future. I also feel Angela Bassett's great powerhouse performance deserves best supporting actress consideration. This is one of the best films of the year.
10," The Beautifully Crafted Film Is Heart Wrenching, But Showcases The Power Of Identity, Culture, Family And Pride
",rannynm,/user/ur1257208/,10 November 2022,"The beautifully crafted film, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is heart wrenching, but also showcases the power of identity, culture, family and pride. The costumes are intricate and gorgeous; the music is moving; and the acting is just spectacular. I felt captivated during every moment of the film, and the nearly realistic world of Wakanda made me feel like I was there myself, even though it is futuristic and fictional.The storyline follows Princess Shuri (Letita Wright) and the Wakandan army as they fight to protect Wakanda from a new force that threatens to attack their home. After the heartbreaking passing of King T'Challah (Chadwick Boseman), Shuri and her mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett) are left with the weight of the country on their shoulders. They must band together with Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), General Okoye (Danai Gurira), and young scientist Riri (Domonique Thorne) as they constantly battle to save the only home they know from an otherworldly army, which threatens the secrets of Wakanda's renowned Vibranium. Will they win this excruciating battle, or will Wakanda fall?Letita Wright, as the protagonist, Princess Shuri, performs beautifully. Her acting choices and authentic emotion are captivating. While this film is dark and somber, there is still enough comedy to keep you chuckling, just at the moment when a little happiness feels most necessary. The music in this film is perfectly aligned with every sequence in the story - powerful in battle scenes; sorrowful at moments of loss; and uplifting in moments of triumph. Without the music, viewers would not be so easily transported into Marvel's Wakandan world. The intricate and bedazzled costuming is gorgeous, displaying the marvelous variety of design from diverse cultures around the world. And last, but most certainly not least, the visual effects and CGI are spectacular. The beauty of Wakanda's futuristic world and technology is so real that you can almost touch it.There are many messages in this film, but two stand out to me the most. First, always trust your heart; it will lead you in the right direction no matter how many paths there are to stray from. Second, no one is ever truly gone, they will live for as long as their memory lives inside you. These messages are uplifting for everyone who needs comfort. Although there is violence in this movie, there is not much gore. The use of a variety of weapons makes this film more appropriate for older children and teens.I give Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

9," Surprised, Impressed, Sad
",unsure-1,/user/ur6830715/,10 November 2022,"I did not expect to like this movie. I was going into it thinking it would be bland, boring and cringe. But I was wrong.Namor scenes were so good. When they first introduce him and his people, it's almost like a horror movie. Very effective.Character motivations come through really clearly. Very strong performances.Amazing soundtrack. Battle scenes, underwater scenes - all deliver. This is a good movie. The ending shook me and it felt like a complete movie arc without leaving any unanswered questions, plenty of options to go further, spinoffs for Ironheart (who was cool too). All in all, I was ready to give it a 5, but to me it felt better than the original."
6," A much needed change
",WrestlingNun,/user/ur60171264/,10 November 2022,"I'll be totally honest. I really disliked Black Panther 1, it is in my top 5 worst Marvel movies of all time, it had great characters but a poor story and lacked a lot of depth overall.This movie is what Black Panther 1 should have been. I dare to say this is by far the best Marvel movie I've seen to date and it's way up there with Iron Man 1, Winter Soldier and GoTG.It was a much needed change after having watched the latest MCU money hungry movies such as Thor 4, Spider-Man 3, Eternals and Doctor Strange 2. We finally got a good entry into all this Phase 4 bs
I watched it last night and I'll be watching it again today. That's how good it is.It feels good not feeling ripped off after paying to watch a Marvel movie."
8," A Rollercoaster
",haribatman-19892,/user/ur128338488/,10 November 2022,"Wakanda Forever is a complete rollercoaster. Starting with emotional scenes, and finishing the film with high packed action. Talking about the positives, the production design, music, and color grading is amazing. The visual effects take you deeper into the film and culture. The actors have done an amazing job and Ryan Coogler is the backbone of the film. Coming to the negatives, the duration could've been shorter, the climax was placed a bit early. A few scenes had noticeably mid CGI. The film failed to emotionally connect with the audience during the climax scenes. Rest assured, it's a lovely film and a must watch one. The comic fans and Namor fans would be completely satisfied."
," Well... it's not what I expected
",wolfstor,/user/ur17135859/,10 November 2022,"Saw this the other night at the movies. The cinema was packed with joyous Marvel fans who have obviously enjoyed the first Black Panther movie. The first 30 minutes into the movie, the audience vibes cooled off noticeably. After 2h41, most people stood up and quickly left the theater, more than half of the crowd not even caring for the end credit scene. Well, that tells you something...After the screening, our group of four discussed what disappointed the most: was it the dragging narrative (trying to tell too many stories and trying to pleasing too many audiences), the lengthy dialogues (which to me felt like they made up 2/3 of this movie), the rushed/forced action scenes or (what bothered me the most) the absence of the Black Panther for most of the running time. In the end, the movie disappoints on many levels."
6," Refuses To Give Up After Boseman's Exit. Slow But A Steady New Rise In The Black Panther's Legacy.
",SAMTHEBESTEST,/user/ur50463365/,10 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) -
Movie Review :-Chadwick Boseman's departure made things very difficult for the Black Panther sequel, not just in terms of casting but also theoretically. Black Panther was a highly successful film because it represented the meeting of American and African cultures in the Marvel universe. I couldn't believe it for a second that a standalone superhero flick like Black Panther earned more than Avengers: Infinity War at the American box office. But that's what describes its popularity, no. Now that Chadwick is gone, it was a big task for the makers to live up to the standard set by him as a character and as a film too. Marvel knows how to make sequels and how to take stories forward, and they did exactly that with Ryan Coogler's superhero saga. Wakanda Forever is somewhat slow but steady sequel that gives new rise to the entire Wakanda universe in the MCU.The film begins with T'Challa's death, and then his mother, Ramonda (Angela Bassett), takes charge as the Queen, who is secretly grieving her big personal loss. Wakanda is left without their protector and most powerful person, Black Panther, when they are attacked by Namor (Tenoch Huerta). Namor also has the same vibranium powers, but he has set his kingdom underwater. An MIT student, Riri (Dominique Thorne), builds a machine that can help the Americans trace vibranium, which is the main reason why Namor wants her dead. However, he has to tackle the Wakandians who stand beside Riri. So it's a three-way battle, but only two sides have to settle things first. Will Wakanda survive against powerful Namor without their protector, or will there be a new hero for them?Wakanda Forever is a well-written script, and Ryan really knew where to spill the dice. He, along with Joe Robert Cole, has written a solid screenplay that compiles the usual conflicts of a superhero flick with human emotions, family drama, and social conscience very well. It takes time to settle, which is fair enough because it isn't a typical money-spinner franchise for Marvel. Black Panther is supposed to be story-driven, unlike other superheroes in the Marvel Universe, and that's what they have tried to do there. Even so, it still has a few flaws that can't be overlooked. A few scenes follow the same tantrums from days gone by, and the heroism is missing too (even with females). Nevertheless, there are more good things than bad, so the battle is won.Black Panther: Wakanda Forever has more female characters than male ones, so it wouldn't be inappropriate to say that the females are the top performers here. Letitia Wright as Shuri takes the lead here. I kind of liked her in the first Black Panther film more than any other supporting character in any Marvel film. There was some excitement about her character, and then the tech-savvy boost really made me fall in love with it. Wakanda Forever takes that away, which is sad, but it brings her to the front, which is the best thing that happened to her. Tenoch Huerta's sexy body and physical appeal speak more than dialogues, and even the attitude is fine. The two supporting pillars of T'Challa's life, his mother, played by Angela Bassett, and his lover, played by Lupita Nyong'o, also deliver a steady performance. Danai Gurira, Winston Duke, Dominique Thorne, Florence Kasumba, Michaela Coel, and Martin Freeman's support are excellent throughout the film.Wakanda Forever is not a heavy VFX film (it was never supposed to be one even in the previous appearances of the superhero), but the action scenes are well executed. They are fewer in number, and with a long runtime of 160 minutes, it is definitely too little. The framework of Autumn Durald Arkapaw is quite fascinating, as the film has so many underwater scenes and many ashore. That ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" feeling has arrived a month earlier. Some may argue, but the editing could have been more crisp, in my opinion. Ryan Coogler knew that he had to carry Boseman's references along with the new story, and he has done a superb job there. Watch out for the surprise in the end credit scene. Wakanda Forever stands steady as an individual film of its own, and you have to watch it for that. It does not include much of the outer world or even the other Avengers like every other Marvel film, so just keep that in mind. It's a wholesome 'Black Panther' film and nothing else, but the emotional quotient adds extra to your viewing experience.RATING - 6/10*"
10," It was perfect, perfect, everything down to the last minute details.
",deepanrajrajan,/user/ur128249421/,10 November 2022,"In telling this story almost exclusively through Black female characters we see not only a triumphant celebration of the strength of Black women, but an exceptional display that grants the rare opportunity for an audience to see a variety of Black women - each with different traits, each essential to the plot and granted both depth and agency. In a Hollywood where Black characters frequently tend to exist without any plot-essential relationship to other Black people shown on screen, or where white characters manage to avoid having more than one Black person in their friendship group, Wakanda Forever offers an embarrassment of representational riches.Yet, an inevitable tension arises within the film in its need to feed the overarching MCU directive. This causes choppy editing choices as well as scenes and characters who feel beamed in from an entirely different film. In part, Coogler manages to make this obligation work to the film's benefit with the introduction of the thoroughly enjoyable Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne), a brilliant MIT student the Wakandans must protect from Namor.RiRi brings a humorous, relatable, fish-out-of-water perspective to proceedings and bounces easily off Okoye and Shuri (Letitia Wright), who aren't just sublime in their portrayals of interior suffering, but as comedic foils for the film's many laugh-out-loud moments. However, for all the effort taken to balance the demands of its narrative, the film's two-hour forty-minute runtime is riddled with pacing issues that, at times, threaten to tip it into tedium.Taking the long view of things, Wakanda Forever heralds the end of the MCU's ""Phase Four"", a phase that, save for the near-universal praise for 2021's Spiderman: No Way Home, has at best been divisive and, at worst, felt like an underwhelming conveyor belt of hollow, mish-mashed placeholders with its titular heroes coming second place to the desire to get us excited about interdimensional space wars.The original Black Panther soared because it sat largely independent of its MCU obligations. But where Phase Three offered a well-oiled and expertly serialised superhero spectacle, Phase Four has shown much more of its machinery, so its presence here - particularly with the emotionally charged purpose of the film - feels much more like baggage that interrupts rather than intertwines.It's no easy feat for a film to act as pallbearer to the late Boseman and deliver a tale that is fresh and future building. Wright, Gurira and especially Bassett rise to the occasion, with Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke also giving committed and exciting performances. As the well-reasoned villain of the piece, Huerta is engaging even when slightly constrained by some of his expositional functions.Coogler admirably takes a big swing with Wakanda Forever and it produces a feature that is fluently in conversation with its predecessor, but less so with its position inside the wider franchise universe. There are some noticeable misses, but the value of such intricate and elevated storytelling cannot be discounted. Indeed, it's worth stressing that many of the film's ailments may still have occurred had Boseman lived. Yet Wakanda Forever pays moving tribute to Boseman and represents a chance for all of us to move forward. Which, ready or not, is a lesson we'll all face at one time or another."
10," Awesomely cool
",KarateKid140708,/user/ur157331716/,10 November 2022,"No joke I thought this film would be a bit rubbish considering it wouldn't have a lot of the fan favourite characters in it, but it was actually amazing, it made characters you didn't know so much a bit more interesting, it made Shuri cool, and the bad guy was super awesome. Also the CGI was amazing, there was this bit where a car and a motorbike were flying in the air and it actually looked so cool. Also the guy from the Vodaphone advertisements was one of the best characters and he looked like a proper secret agent who is really cool. The Shuri person was also dead cool as the character was doing cool fight scenes and stunts. Also the acting was mad cool, it actually looked like the actors where real and they were actually fighting the avatar people.In conclusion I think this film is 10/10 and Steven Spielberg would be impressed."

The movie is by far the best Phase 4 Movie visually , it had great set design and visual effects it was beautifully done .The movie is so emotional prepare yourself you are going to cry . The story is good well done . The new characters that they introduced were really well done by the writers and the actors .For the first time in the MCU the comedy has stepped back to benefit the story and I loved that .Congratulations to all of the people who worked hard to make this movie happen thank you so much."

Better watch this on streaming services once its out.I cant stop talking about how bad the CGI is. When Black Panther walks, its like I am playing a game. Even game animations are better than this. I dont know why they decided to go this route. This is the ugliest Marvel movie of all time. I should've watched Black Adam instead of this cr*p. A lot of people in the cinema are sleeping.

We are served with amazing character growth, meaty plot, great pacing, beautiful score, briliant action sequences and wonderful introduction of the underwater people. My eyes were entirely glued to the screen, I am thoroughly engaged with the whole experience that is Wakanda Forever. Our beloved Chadwick Boseman would be very proud and pleased with how the story continued to go forward and honoring his legacy.

",Fuad_RMNM,/user/ur149922445/,10 November 2022,"Since the 1st time release of Black Panther, the Black Panther world has never been disappointing! Full of surprises. I didn't expect anything but this new movie was Amazing!Sadly, the death of Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther Actor) followed by the death of his char which is happening in this movie. This is dedicated to him. Let him Rest In Peace. Then, the story begins, sorry no spoiler.Visually, I really love this movie because the Wakanda world is very rich in culture & modern tech. BUT, there is greater visual than Wakanda World! A new world! Sorry, no spoiler. Besides, their people and world give us goosebumps sensations such as we live in an ethnic tribe. Their costume, rituals, and voices are unique which I love it!More satisfaction comes from their music and new story plot. This is unexpected for normal moviegoers like me (not a Marvel geek). Since the movie started, I keep wondering about what is gonna happen and how it's gonna end in this movie. Lastly, my current fav's rock song is well-delivered in this movie, lol. They launched a new album this year, sorry tidbits.However, this movie is too long, almost 3 hrs. Looks like Marvel has a new tendency to create long movies since Avengers Trilogy. But, it is no prob, I already dealt with it with took caffeine intake before the cinema!Long story short, don't miss it! Great superhero movie and everything is amazing! Moral values? Proper and not too much. There are also 2 mid-credit scenes on the beach which implied that the black panther would return.8/10."
9," The Black Panther lives!
",cedricdumler,/user/ur70857921/,10 November 2022,"Ryan had already completed the script for a black panther to when Chadwick Boseman tragically passed away. It's a devastating loss, and Coogler and the rest of the cast and crew were reeling from that loss. Coogler made a genius writing choice by making the characters in Wakanda Forever go through the the exact same emotions that the actors themselves went through. All the characters in this film are struggling to come to terms with a loss that they did not expect nor do they fully understand it. In that way we immediately relate to them and are sucked into the story because we as audience and fans of Chadwick feel the exact same way. Coogler made the absolute best of an heartbreaking situation.Wakanda Forever is a geopolitical drama about loss, grief, pain, revenge, suffering and healing - all in the disguise of a blockbuster. Unbelievable performances by the entire cast. Especially Angela Basset, Letitia Wright & Tenoch Huerta. Basset portrays the role of the struggling queen, the grieving mother so believable und raw it's tour de force of acting. Wright also has to relieve every single emotion an actor can show I was completely blown away by her as I did not except that a previous supporting character could carry a movie so well. Lupita Nyong'o as usual is phenomenal, with every scene she's in she injects an extra load of charisma and life into the movie. Her presence is mesmerizing. Danai Gurira's Okoye and Dominique Thorne's Riri bring the humor and laughs to the film, and they were great.And oh boy Marvel Studios just put a new superstar on the field - Tenoch Huerta as Namor is a delight! Raw, almost mystical, full of energy and power. A worthy follow up to the amazing Killmonger. Talocan's introduction is a highlight of the movie, it may be even more fascinating than Wakanda's introduction in the first movie. So visually dazzling, creative and rich in Detail.The VFX scenes where Namor is attacking ships don't look good in parts even unfinished which I found frustrating at times especially because the rest of the movie looks so beautiful.The movie constantly thrives on the cathartic, wonderful, touching and unbelievably atmospheric directing and writing by Ryan Coogler. Ludwig GÃ¶ransson's score is absolutely incredible. There's a scene in the ancestral plane, it's my favorite moment in the movie - the setup, timing, dialogue and exposition here are peak cinema. Chadwick Boseman's spirit radiates through the whole movie. Everything is build around him, his character and the legacy he left. Coogler and his team honored Chad in the most beautiful and respectful way possible. This is a movie that transcends it's medium. It something very special that will be remembered forever. Chad would be proud.Cinema."

",vishalsingh6475,/user/ur27966442/,10 November 2022,"Marvel has failed with the next entry in the Black Panther series. This movie has been hyped too much and doesn't deliver on the acting or story front.They tried to focus too much on the death of black panther (Chadwick Boseman). It seems a good idea for a start of the movie but not good for the whole movie. The new black panther is not as good and charismatic as Chad and movie clearly shows that.CGI was also not up to the mark. It looked good visually in some of the scenes but overall it looked much forced and unnecessary.Overall, this movie lacked the charm, depth and good action sequences to be considered an effective superhero movie. It was pretty mediocre and boring."

Nice that they use some real historical events for the creation of Namor, It was nice to see more from Wakanda and the for the first time a new hidden world. The movie is 10/10 and it is equal to the first black panther."
8," Return to form from the MCU
",vpuyalto,/user/ur158674584/,10 November 2022,"(No spoilers) Black Panther: Wakanda forever not only had big shoes to fill; it had to deal with the death of the beloved king T'Challa, Chadwick Boseman. It handles this tragedy tastefully, showing grief in a more mature way than what you'd expect from Marvel, and it feels more impactful and realistic than the collective grief we've been shown so far for Tony Stark. Visuals and CGI are MUCH better than the first one, and the way the plot and characters intertwine really hits home thanks to fantastic performances from the whole cast, especially Angela Basset. Namor is a great villain-not the best we've seen in this universe, but certainly superior to recent ones. We knew being Killmonger's succesor was a tall task, and the expected comparisons will inevitably make the king of Talocan less iconic; however, his character and the Talocan civilization help explore and develop Wakanda's (and its people) philosophy and relationship with the rest of the world.I believe the things that hurt the movie the most, and justifies a lot of people liking the first one more, is how it's more of a MCU movie than Black Panther. The parts that clearly set up future plot points and keep aspects of the movie from reaching their conclusion can make people less invested in it. Black Panther was, as Wakanda, more separated from the rest of the world. I also think the eeriness and scary factor shown in the first act faded during the movie, losing its suspense, which feels like wasted potential.Ultimately, this feels like a return to form from the MCU, and it shows that they can still make mature, even dark movies, and not just cheap comedic products."
9," We Mourn The Loss of Our King
",MisterJxroen,/user/ur111476141/,10 November 2022,"I was lucky enough to view a double-bill (both installments back to back) avant-premiere screening of 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' in cinemas. I was very curious to see how the people at Marvel as well as the actors were going to tackle the sudden loss of our beloved Chadwick Boseman, may he rest in peace. I'm happy to say they did a phenomenal job to honor both Chadwick Boseman as King T'challa.From a story point of view, I loved this movie even more then the first. Though Chadwick Boseman leaves behind a hole in the heart of the story, he's still there with us. His legacy, both that of him as his character - as well as his presence is constantly felt throughout the movie. I truly believe that this is the way Chadwick would've wanted this movie to be as well.Letitia Wright did a phenomenal job despite the sad circumstances. She managed to take her emotions and blend that into an incredible acting performance, which felt real because it was real. Just like it is for 'Shuri', the events that have happened are upsetting, depressing and unbelievable - just like what has happened to Boseman. But just like it did for her in the movie, this story really helped me truly accept the losses of an awesome character and an incredible human being.All of the other cast members managed to really up their game as well, leaving us with only pristine performances. I was very satisfied with Tenoch Huerta's portrayal of 'Namor', our antagonist. He was quite intidimating and his presence/power was felt throughout the movie, since it has been so strongly established that Wakanda is the most powerful nation in the world - and he managed to make them have a run for their money. The concept of their two powerful nations colliding because of the mistakes of others, is meaningful and suspenseful to watch.I adored the music, both Ludwig GÃ¶ransson's score as well as the features. It captures the right emotion or vibe (loss, action, evil, hope, vengeance, ...) just perfectly well to bring us even closer to that moment. Ryan Coogler crushed it once more as well as director and lead writer of the story. I hope he gets recognized more and proceeds to make many more amazing projects.The cinematography and world building was, once again, incredible. The sight of Wakanda will never get old. Namor's city also looked incredibly unique, though it reminded me of Atlantis but that was to be expected.It was an emotional rollercoaster with gut wrenching action sequences, powerful emotional moments and a way for us to heal. I will forever miss Chadwick as ""The Black Panther"", as he will remain that forever in my heart. I like to think that if he could see this film from above, he would be smiling. Just as I and all the other fans that were sitting besides me in the theater and all across the world."
7," One of the best projects in phase 4
",DanteMonteverde,/user/ur82273959/,10 November 2022,"This film did was so well done considering the circumstances of production. The lead actor of the movie tragically died. So suddenly you have to write a whole new story around other characters. I think this film is really good. It's certainly a return to form for the mcu after most of the movies in phase 4 being horrible. Definitely the best one besides no way home.The acting is phenomenal in this film. Iron heart was the standout character for me, I think they did well in handling her as a plot device but also introducing her. It didn't feel like she was forced into the story just to promote her show. She actually served the plot well. Dominique Thorne was absolutely amazing as her.Overall one of the best projects in phase 4 and is a great tribute to Chadwick Boseman.8/10."
8," Pays an appropriately sombre tribute to its recently deceased lead actor by showing how things can still move forward in the wake of his absence
",MrDHWong,/user/ur18374284/,10 November 2022,"""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is the sequel to 2018's ""Black Panther"" and the 30th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed and co-written by Ryan Coogler (""Fruitvale Station"", ""Creed""), it pays an appropriately sombre tribute to its recently deceased lead actor by showing how things can still move forward in the wake of his absence.One year after the untimely death of King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the African kingdom of Wakanda is still in mourning as they struggle without their beloved monarch to lead them. T'Challa's younger sister, Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright), feels the immense pressure to take over as ruler but believes she cannot handle such a huge responsibility all by herself. Not long after, the inhabitants of the underwater civilisation of Talokan, led by King Namor (Tenoch Huerta), emerge to wage a war against the surface world. With limited time remaining, the citizens of Wakanda must quickly overcome their grief to put a stop to the Talokan threat before everything is destroyed.After the unfortunate passing of ""Black Panther"" actor Chadwick Boseman in 2020 due to cancer, the MCU was left with a complicated dilemma - should the sequel recast the lead role with a different actor or should they re-write an entirely new story without him? Either of these options would have been a risky move since audiences have become so familiar with Boseman's portrayal of King T'Challa (a.k.a the Black Panther) that it would be near impossible to accept anyone else in the role. It was soon revealed that out of respect for both Boseman and the fans that the latter option was chosen, with the character's in-world demise intended to mirror the actor's real-life death. Now with the release of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"", we see how all of this has managed to play out, in a follow-up that makes good use of its supporting cast while also remaining respectful to the foundations that have already been laid down.Anybody who saw the 2018 film will remember it has already been established that Wakanda is a place full of interesting characters that have helped this kingdom thrive for so long in seclusion. Because of this, it is believable that its citizens can continue to function without a King due to their personal code of discipline. However, due to their overwhelming admiration for King T'Challa, the Wakandans still feel a sense of emptiness with him no longer being around to lead them and as a result, they are living directionless lives. This is all conveyed to us primarily through the characters that knew T'Challa best and the audience gains a solid understanding of the grief they are each experiencing.I think the film does a decent job of exploring the concept of losing someone you deeply care about, whether it is a close family member or someone you admired from afar. In particular, we get a good look at how Shuri, the next in line to the throne, just cannot bring herself to take her brother's place as the rightful ruler of Wakanda. Despite her lingering heartache, Shuri, along with the rest of Wakanda's de facto leaders, must find a way to set aside her sadness to confront the looming annihilation by advancing enemy forces. Most of the film shows how not only Shuri, but also Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ramonda (Angela Bassett) all need to work together in order to prevent a major catastrophe from happening. I interpret this plot element as a metaphor for depression as a whole, since rising above intense emotional pain often requires the help of others. Because of that, this is a nice way of telling the audience that no matter how hard things may seem, there will always be others to aid them through their own personal difficulties.Due to the prevalent themes of loss and despair, this is the most melancholic film in the entire MCU library, even more so than the beginning of ""Avengers: Endgame"". Naturally this is a striking departure from the MCU we are all familiar with, which is usually light-hearted and fun for practically everybody. As a result, there are very few moments of comic relief to brighten the mood, and even then it does little to help alleviate the severity of a specific scene. If you are expecting the usual humorous situations that MCU fans have grown accustomed to after all these years or the characters constantly cracking jokes at a convenient time, you are going to be sorely disappointed.This film never wavers on its downbeat tone, with frequent reminders that the original hero is dead and not coming back. Of course, this is entirely understandable considering it would be disrespectful to not take into account Chadwick Boseman's monumental contribution to the series and the film plays along like something crucial is missing without him. Bearing that in mind, the film is still enjoyable in other ways. It does contain a number of good action scenes with some creative fight choreography and a deeper exploration of Wakandan lore to keep the audience invested. These are easily the most entertaining aspects of the film, as they remind us that Wakanda is more than simply the location where the Black Panther character originated. Just don't expect to be smiling too much during these highlights.Out of the three main actors whom the film chooses to focus on, I think Letitia Wright really shone the most as Shuri. Though we have seen Shuri do many important things in previous MCU films, I think it is here where we finally get to see her come into her own. Gone is the confident, meme-quoting sister of King T'Challa and in her place is a mournful, vulnerable young woman who misses her brother and just can't see herself taking his place as leader. Regardless of this shift in personality, Shuri still retains her intelligent side, which is featured much more extensively in this film than we've ever seen before. It's quite impressive to see how well Wright plays into Shuri's insecurities, never once exaggerating her emotions to the point of caricature or melodrama. Instead, she is shown to be a relatable human being, coming to terms with the sudden curveball life has thrown her.Though I must admit, none of this would have worked as well for Wright without the help of Angela Bassett and Danai Gurira as Ramonda and Okoye, respectively. As previously mentioned, they are all dealing with grief in their own unique ways but soon learn that working together to overcome it as a team is the best strategy. These characters feel like a real family, sticking together through what needs to be done to protect Wakanda from anything that threatens their existence. Even with the King no longer around to assist them, these three still prove themselves a formidable force against any hardship they may face.Given the unexpected turn of events surrounding the death of its main star, this film works surprisingly well with its remaining cast members and a more interesting look at Wakanda's place in the MCU. It's hard to say for certain how things may have turned out had Chadwick Boseman lived to reprise his role here, but if I had to guess I would assume we'd have gotten a more optimistic sequel without that feeling of loss hovering over every scene. Personally, I think they made the right decision not to recast and with all of that said, I am nonetheless convinced that Boseman would be pleased to see his legacy honoured in the best way possible under these circumstances. I know I would be.I rate it 8/10."
8," A good ending to phase 4
",ars29792,/user/ur24272342/,10 November 2022,"Phase 4 has definitely been slower or less exciting than previous phases but I believe it was meant as such, as the world is recovering from the aftermath of Thanos.But I would say Wakanda Forever was a great end to this phase with its convincing acting by all the casts, awesome world building, memorable music and a good plot with how they handled the introduction of Namor, his history and reasoning for doing what he does. The fighting scenes may have been CGI galore, but it was done beautifully.There were a few bits and pieces for the larger MCU scattered across the movie but make no mistake as this movie had the Black Panther/Chadwick passing as an important focus of the movie and how it has affected all the characters we know and love from the previous movie.All I can say now is, bring on Phase 5, Feige!!"
5," Yet another safe and predictable movie
",alexander-harenstam,/user/ur50245621/,10 November 2022,"Marvel does it again - delivers a safe and predictable movie. Each character is protected by plot armor. The hero initially struggles, but always manages to overcome his/her challenges, even when facing deadly wounds. No injury is fatal and the villain would rather chat than kill. The police doesn't even fire bullets at the heroes after surrounding them.On the positive side, the effects are amazing. The CGI/animation team has, as always, outdone themselves. The scene of the water city is incredible and can definitely rival the new Avatar movie. Underwater caption is dope. I just wish that the plot lived up to the effects. That Hollywood could grow some balls and create an actual compelling story that's realistic and has depth, rather than these shallow hero save the day type of movies."
9," A great story and nice scenes
",frxkqpxygr,/user/ur158667963/,10 November 2022,"The movie was great because there is a good story line and we take time to explain the details of the life of each characters. The context is well describe and the actions were also great. Not too many fight, the correct balance between discussion, story telling and fight. Recent movies tend to over extend fight with a lot of effects but here this correct. The life under water is a great idea and the visual in this movie are insane.The recent marvel movies are coming with too much jokes but here gain we have only few scenes with it.In overall that's a great movie with good balance between jokes, fights, story. Would recommend."
9," Probably one of the best written UCM movies.
",Jairito-4444,/user/ur152826879/,10 November 2022,"It was a journey through pain, tears, revenge, healing and reconciliation. We can feel the silent path that Shuri has to traverse and we feel every inch of it.There are some parts that make me uncomfortable, but in the end it is part of the construction of the plot. My feelings don't matter in the face of what the movie does well.Magnificent direction by Coogler, a soundtrack that hits the spot. Incredible, absolutely incredible. The movie deceived me with its apparently complex structure, the conflict between the three nations is somewhat latent and the fear is relentless.The film builds itself beautifully. It doesn't feel weird, it's completely genuine and the writing is brilliant.Nothing more to say. The best written movie in the MCU."

",dtzqhwg,/user/ur155536893/,10 November 2022,"Wakanda Forever Is The Most Emotional Movie Of The Phase 4, I Enjoyed It. Ryan Coogler Direct Masterpiece, Academy Awards Are Coming... Music, Direct, Crew And etc. Everything Are Perfect. WAKANDA FOREVER. I Rally Enjoyed It. The death of T'Challa - and actor Chadwick Boseman - weighs heavy on Wakanda Forever, with the fictional nation struggling to replace both their monarch and their champion, and Marvel Studios deciding how to honor a man it was clearly ready to work with for years and years to come. Wakanda Forever is an effective, emotional farewell to T'Challa - a meditation on forging one's own future out of a painful past - but with a plot that has to introduce an entirely new nation and pave the way for a new wave of Marvel stories, it does struggle under the weight of all that expectation. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is at its most effective when paying tribute to its fallen king, and strong performances from the returning cast keep it afloat through its occasionally choppy plot."
8," CELEBRATION!
",vinifernandes,/user/ur62718496/,10 November 2022,"The movie ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"", is a celebration of our late and prime Black Panther, the irreplaceable Chadwick Boseman. But it is also, another celebration for the African community.It accentuates the identity of Ryan Cooper as a director that wants to show the African essence in the story of the Black Panther. And for that, the movie is an another masterpiece.On the other hand, the movie also brings a new chapter, and challenge, introducing Namor and his people.It also empowers and establish the women of Wakanda, as the center roles of the country. Especially, Okoye, Nakia, Shuri and the Queen (which is portrayed under an academy performance by Angela Bassett).The film is also incredibly beautiful, arguably the most beautiful cinematography and cenografy on the Marvel movies. Additionally, capturing new traits of the people, and introducing new stories around the Vibranium ramifications, such as Riri Williams, which was presented accordingly.In my opinion the only thing that slips, on this film, is the pace of the third act, which disassociates the screenplay, and ""tries to explain many things on a short period of time"". This creates a little bit of doubt, concerning the future of Wakanda, and all the tension evoked by the events presented, throughout the World.However, overall, it's another great experience, that need to be celebrated and cherished by all."
10," Destruction and love
",baz-ramu,/user/ur40622954/,10 November 2022,"Wow this movie was not only a emotional roller coaster it was a healing movie for not just the actors as it was for the world. We all lost a great and wonderful actor Chadwick Boseman. It also shown that it still was a great nation without the king and aloud actors that where behind in the first movie to take on a more mature leading role. It was good to see the Queen of Wakanda take charge and express her loss and pain she felt.It was fantastic to see Shuri mature and become the......
Shuri found her own way of healing which was very touching.The action and details in the costumes and suits was on point the script was superb with more subtitles for more languages which was awesome also allows more people to connect to the movie.Worth the wait, definitely went beyond what I expected brilliant and beautiful movie. Black Panther Wakanda Forever."
5," Disappointing in almost every way
",alexnicolex,/user/ur66035460/,10 November 2022,"There's a trace of a good movie somewhere in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Immediately, the movie focalizes on the loss of Chadwick Boseman, and pays homage to him through a distressing yet powerful sequence. Then the actual movie starts, and it gets mediocre pretty quickly. To my memory, the MCU has never been more dull, more visually boring: the cinematography didn't give us the grandiosity we were expecting from a movie touching the death of a beloved actor, the discovery of a new and misterious civilization. It all feels and looks flavorless, rushed and disjointed. Despite the massive space in narration that is given to exposition, we get never really acquainted with the reign of Talocan and its tradition, and the explanation on why the conflict arises never feels believable or justified. Where the movie is best at is at paying homage to the late Boseman, giving us some thoughtful reflections on the tragedy of the death of a dear one, and how we can grow in a difficult situation such as this one. Unfortunately, the rest of the movies shies away from this somber tone, and prefers to get back to the usual, predictable (tiresome?) Marvel formula."
7," Unlikely to make the same impact as the original, Wakanda Forever is a mature and effective Marvel outing
",eddie_baggins,/user/ur8462477/,9 November 2022,"A cultural phenomenon that was the rare type of film that struck a chord with critics, audiences, box office booths and the awards circuits, 2018's Black Panther was one of the most resounding success stories of the Marvel cinematic universe, with it always going to be a tough task for returning director Ryan Coogler to strike the same gold he did with his beloved first foray into the Marvel world.The task Coogler and his creative partners faced was made all the monumental by the tragic and shattering passing of T'Challa/Black Panther himself Chadwick Boseman, the type of heartbreaking real life loss the Marvel world has never had to overcome before in this way but against all the odds Black Panther: Wakanda Forever succeeds in somehow working with the passing of Boseman to make a cohesive film, that may not be ground-breaking, but offers up a very different type of Marvel film that is centred and driven by grief both imagined and real.Undoubtedly an entirely different film than the one that was first being developed by Coogler, Forever wastes little time dealing with T'Challa's demise and all of the films sombre moments of respect and consideration for the life of both the character and Boseman in turn is handled with aplomb here and when moving through the films (sadly overlong) 160 minute runtime, it's not too see and feel that this is an entirely different type of Marvel exercise that thankfully places the off-kilter comedic focussed mode it's been operating in since the early Guardians and Thor: Ragnarok days to deliver a more mature offering that's fairly likely to not win over the younger fans that have made Marvel their own over the last decade.With Boseman and T'Challa no longer the central focus of the Black Panther universe, much extra weight has been added onto the likes of Letitia Wright's Shuri, Angela Bassett's Ramonda, Winston Duke's M'Baku and Danai Gurira's Okoye, with all returning players once more delivering the goods for Coogler on the acting front with Wright in particular impressing with a character that is now largely far removed from the one we initially saw in the original.As is usually the case with a Marvel outing some of the best moments in Forever stem from the new players with Dominique Thorne's feisty and gung-ho Riri likely to be a new fan favourite (even if her role here is slightly forced) while Tenoch Huerta's new adversary Namor is one of the more effective ""villains"" Marvel has introduced in the cinematic landscape since the full reveal of Thanos many moons ago.Mostly recognisable from some TV work and mid-tier feature films, Huerta's take on the underwater dwelling Namor is a massive win for the film and much like Killmonger in the 2018 outing, his performance and character arc provides much weight to a film that without him may have felt like a lesser event, with motivations one can understand up to a point and enough development and growth where we can see so much potential both good and bad, Huerta and in turn Namor make us wish for more exploration of a whole new kingdom of Marvel that is hopefully explored even more than it is successfully but briefly looked at here.Another element of Forever that must be made note of and celebrated is the work of composer Ludwig GÃ¶ransson who creates one of the most unique and noticeably effective Marvel scores we've yet encountered and while his work in the first film and other recent outings such as Tenet and The Mandalorian TV series showcase a talented artist at work, this is the type of score that heralds in the official arrival of a composer that could be about to shake the industry up in all the right ways.With a lot of elements to enjoy, Forever is unlikely to have the same type of impact either culturally or narratively as the first outing did and there will be some that find Coogler's close to three hour epic overly long in the tooth with a sagging middle section the most notable instance of running through the motions, while some side characters that appear set to play bigger parts merely come and go when it pleases the story, with the film at its best when it allows the likes of Shuri and Namor the time they deserve in the spotlight, especially without an Avenger or an unnecessary cameo in sightFinal Say -Considering the odds stacked against it, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is without question another success story for Marvel but not everything pays off in Coogler's high-reaching outing that overstays its welcome at times and may find itself fairly/unfairly judged against an original it's not going to match for impact or sentiment.3 1/2 wing feet out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
8," Only logical
",brianlespoir,/user/ur153347358/,9 November 2022,"The faith of Wakanda was preditable with Chadman Boseman leaving us, but writers wrote what was only logical with a very good and unexpected setup for the third movie. I loved it and will see it again as soon as possible.The cast was as expected with as many original cast members as possible. The acting was good, Angela Basset was strong in the role she played. Letitia Wright was very good and the others where as in their previous roles as good as expected.I enjoyed Namor and his people. I liked it that it wasn't all glamour in his ""kingdom"", kinda as you could expect underwater.Riri was good, but her suit was a bit toy-ish, it needs to mature.Can't wait for BP3, so don't go see it for yourself."
10," Surprisingly deep movie goes beyond the comic
",ykjdh,/user/ur156087945/,9 November 2022,"I'll admit, I really had no interest in seeing this movie after it's lead passed away. Then I read this is based on a volume of the comics where another panther steps in because I guess the hero passed away in the series too at one point. Still, I really enjoyed the first movie so much I saw it three times in theaters and bought the blu ray. So not only was I skeptical about a new panther but skeptical about sequels in general because they never hold a candle to the original.Within the first few minutes though I was hooked in the story. It opens with a pretty surprising emotional bang then goes from there. This movie is over 2 1/2 hours long but it seemed to just fly on by and my interest was held the whole entire way. Ryan Coogler returns as director who brought the first one to life and I'm glad he came back to tell this story. He did an excellent job with this movie and told an exciting story along the way.No spoilers but if the beginning of this doesn't grab your attention then something's wrong. I found it to be a surprising tribute but also a motivational piece of life goes on so you can never quit. Loss, hurt, regret, survivor's guilt, and other emotions make this feel more than just a comic book movie. Disney has a habit of trying to make everything politically safe but I'm glad Ryan Coogler didn't go that way. Instead he chose to focus more on the character's and their stories. I recommend this one be seen in theaters to get the full experience of action and some of the better effects in movies."

Letitia Wright was so strong as Shuri and showed us exactly how well a female superhero can be written and acted without it being corny.(looking at you Captain Marvel)The musical score was amazing and epic, and the music from Burna boy, Stormzy, Rihanna and more really fit the theme of the movie well. The cgi was amazing as always and the fighting was amazing as well. And we can't forget the villain, who was also really really great. There was sort of and mutual understanding between Namor, Wakanda and the viewer which I really liked. It reminded me a lot of killmonger from the first movie, and a bit of thanos as well.Definitely go watch the movie in theatres, you will not be disappointed!"

",4liReza,/user/ur37330830/,9 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a great movie and a great sequel. As expected, this movie is emotional and the makers have done a fantastic job in making this movie. It is really difficult to make a sequel without the star of the original movie, and Ryan Coogler has managed to handle this challenge well.The film is outstanding and manages to depict loss, grief and revenge with a maturity and seriousness that has rarely been seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Like the previous film, this new work is considered one of Marvel's outstanding works. Angela Bassett, Letitia Wright and Tenoch huerta were also able to play their roles well.Black Panther 2 is a beautiful tribute to Chadwick Boseman and his loss. This movie has been able to beautifully portray the sadness of losing a person and apart from that, the action of the movie is also very good.And in the end, This show is undoubtedly the best Marvel movie since Avengers: Endgame. It is an emotional journey that was totally worth waiting for.."
7," The ghost of Chadwick Boseman but the movie was interesting
",AvionPrince16,/user/ur104763420/,9 November 2022,"I need to say that i had many questions about many things for Black panther: who will have the throne? What Shuri will become? What happened to Nakia? Who will succeed to the Chadwick Boseman's black panther?Every questions has been answered and i anticipated that Shuri will become the new black panther even if we had some doubts at the beginning: because we saw her mother in the throne and command. The movie have the same spirit as the first one and continue: the wakanda shared ressources but they will failed for that and we saw again agent Ross and thats a great pleasure and we saw they have the same jokes between Ross and Okoye about the colonisateur's thing. Namor was an interesting character and his way to move and attack is pretty interesting: he seems to be an hero at the beginning but Shuri will find how dangerous he can be with that clever girl that they found at school. But they give us a new future for the wakanda and the Namor's people at the end: a secret alliance between them and that is pretty believable. Namor just wanted to kill the student.The tribute to Chadwick Boseman was great and sad at the same time: we saw the images from the other movie and really make us remembered when he was alive. Again at the end, Shuri will remember him. But we have a revelation about T'challa'son who appear and maybe will have his legacy? And will return as the son of T'challa. Sound good for the next movie. And we will have his son now. What else to say? It was pretty great anyway. Like i said its the same spirit as the first movie: we saw some similar scenes about Wakanda, the ancestral thing, the new suits for the wakanda and the new Black panther. I was pretty surprised to see Killmonger in this movie. And that was a great surprise: i thought we will never saw him again but he got a little moment for him. Mbaku is still there and will help Shuri as he promise to T'challa. A nice movie and a great tribute to Chadwick Boseman and some good perspective for the future: Namor and his alliance with Wakanda, the new Black Panther, the real successor of T'challa(his son), a new movie with his son as the new king? We need to see and wait for now. But that sound good."
10," Emotional, straight to the point and hope for Marvel
",prabjhooti,/user/ur158658104/,9 November 2022,"Saw this movie tonight and I have to admit its without a ounce of doubt the best Marvel movie has produced in phase 4. Its very emotional and stays true to the legacy of Black Panther. I won't spoil anything, but its definetly worth a watch if you are one of those who has been getting bored of recent Marvel releases.Global struggle, conflicts among main characters, healing and good-feel music throughout the movie was itself worth 10 stars, if not more. This is truly one of those movies you could have a 2nd or 3rd watch without getting boring. It has action, suspense, drama, altough comedy was a bit lacking in this one, but it is not anything you're going to miss. Everything else felt nice phased, no drag-out scenes, it keeps you addicted to the big screen. Without spoiling it - I'm just going to say the best part about the movie is the END :) Have a great watch - good job to creators of this movie and RIP Chadwick Boseman!"
8," A Great Watch
",ozborni,/user/ur23452240/,9 November 2022,"I really enjoyed this movie. They had such a difficult task to creating something that linked tastefully with it's predecessor that didn't diminish or erase the awesome character Chadwick had developed and I believe they did really well (choosing the best of what were limited options in my opinion)My friend and comic book connoisseur said there were a few things characters said or did that were accurate to the comic (they flew over my head but nice to understand afterwards). Our session clapped and laughed throughout the movie and I could hear/see a few guys around sniffing or discretely wiping their eyes so I think the performances and story was quite compelling.The story revolving around two very unique cultures, their leaders and their interaction with each other was not lost on me (fantasy being better than reality as always)The effects, scenes and settings were in my opinion excellent and immersive. Sound was also great, although I was missing the Kendrick Lamar soundtracks.Overall a great movie in my opinion."

",Casjvdm,/user/ur152590070/,9 November 2022,"I went in with the idea that a movie of almost 3 hours is too long, but this has passed so quickly, especially with a 4DX experience. Due to Chadwick's passing, the film had to be re-imagined, and they handled it well! They also give some commemorative moments like at the beginning (with marvel logo with short Chadwick bits).On the other hand, it was also one of my first marvel movies, and I definitely plan to watch the newer ones. So in short: An incredibly cool film that is really doable in IMAX and 4DX! Take enough food and drink with you. The storyline is just really well put together, and that without the official main character!Wakanda forever. X."
8," Best of Phase 4 and contender for Top 10 MCU
",scottythedrummer,/user/ur71685556/,9 November 2022,"From the frantic but quiet opening moments, Wakanda Forever feels more real, more grounded and more mature. What unfolds is a layered story worried less about action. The performances all round are truly excellent and you forget this is a mostly women cast (not that it matters) When the action and stakes are ramped up by the third act it feels earned, not just edited in. I love the score, I love the moments of quiet and almost slowness and that it took its time. I loved the comedy sprinkled through. Also the 3D had moments but mostly I didn't notice it. A couple of negatives, runtime feels a little long and I could have done with a little more action but these are nitpicks to what is ultimately a great movie and touching tribute to Chadwick Boseman. Highly recommended."
7," A solid sequel led by women
",krutidojan-28245,/user/ur67507540/,9 November 2022,"""Avatar: The Way of Water"", that u?---This is a solid sequel and a beautiful tribute to Chadwick Boseman. I'm not sure how I feel about the plot in general, but the character work in this movie is great. Shuri and Okoye being my obvious faves, their arcs in this script are really good. The actors are great and there is not a single weak link in the cast. It does feel a bit disjointed at times, and there are some minor characters whose motivations aren't very clear to me.I also think this might be Marvel's most feminist movie to date. Like 80% of the main cast is made up of women, a lot of them in positions of power, which is never once questioned. The women are written as full and complex people with strengths and weaknesses and I honestly CAN'T BELIEVE I have to praise this movie for that because it should be the bare freaking minimum. But it isn't and I'm really happy this movie shows such a wide range of female characters portrayed by incredible actresses.Oh and btw, I truly thought I was watching the wrong movie for a second when the blue water-people showed up, especially since they showed the Avatar-trailer right before the movie started. Now I feel even less of a need to see the new Avatar. Great news for me tbh!"

It doesnt take too much sad story about Chadwick, they give you flashback with quiet sound and it's really touching. But it's not what they sell.The formula of villain becomes partner is usually boring, but not on this movie.The figure of new characters as villain, is very well described.Less jokes, a lot of cool scene, great effects.And I like how they tell us that there are lot of victim, not like most of superheroes movies, we never know if there is anyone died, or just got damage.Or maybe it doesnt feel like superhero movie it self."

",HabibieHakim123,/user/ur105506099/,9 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a weak overlong boring slow-paced of a movie, it's NOT A BAD FILM, it's more of like a super mediocre average movie that are going super slow and nothing really exciting happening, it is mostly feels empty, the movie still has it's moments and performances, i think all the performance was great, i like some of the visual and sound, but compare to the first Black Panther not only at first the 2018 Black Panther movie feels like a celebration, this one is a grieving, so much things that are just less than the first one, the music is not as good, the fight scene is not as good, and the visual is not as good, so what do i like again about the movie, Namor i think was a pretty good villain, not the best villain ever but he was still pretty good, all the fight scene was pretty good (except the final battle i can count about only 3 or 4 fight scene for 2 hours and 41 minutes movie and yes that's another flop for me, it's too few for a movie this long), final battle was ok again not making me excited or anything, Riri Williams was alright too, i still expected more from her, and the new Black Panther suit was sweet!, not really buying the blue people, so overall i didn't hate Black Panther: Wakanda Forever like i hate Thor: Love And Thunder, and i didn't leave the theater pissed about it like i did with Thor: Love And Thunder, it is another miss twice in a row for an MCU film, a super flawed movie that feels empty, feels long, and feels bored for the most part, still has it's moments and pros in it, not a bad movie, but definitely a disappointment and still a miss."
10," Better than the first one!
",TheDyingGirl,/user/ur67334856/,9 November 2022,"Very poignant. I loved that they didn't just chuck T'challa to the side and just move on with the storyline. I loved that the movie actually had a storyline instead of constant fighting which is something that marvel movies tend to have too much off and neglect fleshing out the story in favour of blowing things up. Loved the dialogue, witty but not overdone. Also unlike the other marvel movies I actually empathised with the villain. Yes he was a bit extreme but do you blame his fear especially considering the history of his people and when he noticed the rest of the world trying to get their paws in Wakanda's honey after T'challa and his dad went public with their nation . Obviously the movie has to have a villain but initially I was rooting for the guy. The chemistry between him and Shuri was palpable. Hoping to see their friendship/alliance if they ever are following movies coming up."
9," What a way to cap off phase 4
",simplygk,/user/ur127661473/,9 November 2022,The movie was amazing and not just a tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman. They only had a tribute to him at the very beginning and the final scene of the movie. The story was so well told and there was a lot of depth to it. The introduction of namor was done brilliantly and really hope we see more of him in the MCU in the future. The action sequences were great and there wasn't an excessive overuse of comedy apart from a few quirky one liners. The CGI in this was much better and not so excessive on the colours like it was in the first movie. Ryan Coogler absolutely nailed it with this movie and I hope we see him do more with the MCU.
10," Simply Amazing. Love the settings, the costumes. The emotions
",johnlcl,/user/ur15044489/,9 November 2022,Highly recommended. A great honour to the late Chadwick Boseman. Marvel has bring it home again with this one. A definite must watch. Love how much heart and soul was poured into creating this magnificent world. Fight scenes were really amazing and they've managed to capture the underwater world so beautifully. A little disappointed that Shuri's costume design did not follow the comic books though with the cloak. That would have been really cool. Definitely stay after the credits for a little surprise. Looking forward to seeing what's to come with those new characters they've introduced to the marvel universe.
5," If you are fan of Chadwick's Black Panther from 1st one, you'll definitely notice his absence
",Abhi_Original,/user/ur27061097/,9 November 2022,"The movie does the emotional things well, but I didn't like how they handled the Black Panther's mantle situation. There are some details which are spoilery, but I think it'll be very divisive.Namor was well introduced and portrayed by the actor, but the movie fails in doing the same for Talocan. I get that it'd have made the movie even longer, but it's already too long with possibility of trimming 20 odd minutes, and when you have to do conflict between Talocan vs Wakanda, then you have to lean into it. Maybe, it wasn't a good decision to involve it in a movie which was already dealing with tribube to the main character this franchise is based on. Maybe, recasting someone for this iconic role would've been better decision, but their emotions got the better of it as they were very close to filming it when Boseman sadly passed away.Overall, it's not as good as the 1st one, still enjoyable. MCU needed lifting after DS2 & Thor 4, but I think some people would still prefer DS:2 over it for reasons which might not go well with everyone."
10," They did it!
",fihord,/user/ur103077312/,9 November 2022,"I didn't think they could do a good second Black Panther movie after Chadwick Bosman passed away but they did
It is beautiful and entertaining
The cast are incredible. Can't believe I saw this and Black Adam in the same week. Black Adam was ridiculous and this was sublime. MCU develops characters you care about and DC blows stuff up. See it before any spoilers. And yes things get blown up in the MCU too but you care when the do.First MCU movie since Endgane that hits all the right buttons. Great mix between the established cast and some new faces in the MCU.With things so bad in the world right now it's nice to escape for a couple of hours
Wakanda Forever!!!"

10," Must see! Greatness!
",papanaklis,/user/ur115520304/,9 November 2022,"It is so Epic. Black Panther - Wakanda Forever emerged as one of the best Marvel movies to date. It is a much-needed boost of faith and quality - something that the MCU Phase 4 has been such a bumpy ride after the post-Endgame era. The film is shot beautifully with its gorgeous cinematography and color palette being far more noticeable than most other Marvel projects. The regality of the Wakanda regime, from landscapes to the CGI technology to the costuming, the visuals are even better in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever than the original 2018 film. The storyline is fluid, engaging, and constantly moving - one of the best scripts from Marvel. The movie has the muscle and heft of a comic-book blockbuster, but it also reflects profoundly on the human resonance of ancestry, remembering and moving on. Wakanda Forever manages to be both epic and intimate at the same time. Greatness!"
10," A true, best sequel and an epic conclusion for phase 4 of Marvel
",SpiderMan2543,/user/ur52078900/,9 November 2022,"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever truly delivered on all fronts. Plot is great, Namor is awesome, the powerful and emotional tone for this movie fits perfectly, and most of all, it does not contain your typical marvel humor like past marvel movies, which granted I loved the humor from the past marvel movies. This Marvel movie was truly unique in every way, and the way it honors and pays tribute to Chadwick Boseman's legacy is perfect. This movie is perfect in every way. The story is just as good as it's predecessor, and I honestly can't wait for Black Panther 3. And one last thing, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is just as good as the first Black Panther movie. It truly is. You can't deny nor even doubt that fact."
8," Tons of Respect. Brilliant cinematography. Lack of Traditional Actions
",johnnzsilva,/user/ur134189545/,9 November 2022,"I really love it. It is really unorthodox approach to traditional super hero movies. Brilliant cinematography. It lacks traditional actions thus may make it bit slow facing. But it capture you suddenly with scenary and dialogues. Events are much stronger and unique. It may cut scenes very quickly, strength and weaknesses in the screenplay I believe. I m waiting to see how the world view the movie critically and box office vise. I m reviewing this movie while i m watching it, This is my first movie critic and i m glad this is the movie I m reviewing and certainly the first movie review for Black Panther."
," Paying respect with vibrancy
",Gordon-11,/user/ur0035842/,9 November 2022,"This film tells the story of Wakanda having to mourn the loss of their king, while having to defend themselves from external threats.""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is very well done. It doesn't lose any continuity in the story, despite the sad loss of Chadwick Boseman. In fact, it manages to pay respects, and then move forward with vibrant energy. The story is engaging, and I didn't feel the length of the film at all despite it being close to three hours long. The computer visual effects are fantastic, and I'm truly marvelled by what the studio has accomplished. I'm glad I got up early to watch the first show on the opening day!"
8," A big challenge that Ryan Coogler overcame!
",Matt-Canalcon,/user/ur15712795/,9 November 2022,"I want to start by saying I haven't been the biggest fan of this Phase 4 by Marvel that started with Black Widow in 2020, it's been hit & miss for me so I was nervous for the sequel to Black Panther. I'm happy to report that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a success. I think Ryan Coogler and his team hit a home run with Wakanda Forever by paying tribute to Chadwick Boseman and moving the story forward respectfully.I won't go into spoilers, but the movie starts with an emotional bang. Wakanda Forever builds on the great fondation that was established in the first Black Panther, a visual feast with breathtaking production design, fantastic costumes and impressive action sequences. The music from Ludwig Goransson is once again phenomenal, he creates a signature to this film that gives us the iconic sound of Wakanda while incorporing new themes for this sequel.Similar to the first film with Wakanda, there's a lot of world-building with the newly introduced Namor and the underwater world. This allows director Ryan Coogler to let his vision shine on the screen, it's spectacular to look at and the way they filmed the underwater sequences was truly astonishing. Ironically, most of superhero movies depend on their villains in order to succeed, they nailed it with Killmonger and what they did here is just as good, if not better.I don't think it's a perfect film, with a hefty runtime of 161 minutes, there are some moments that were dragging in the middle for me, but I think it was necessary for this film to be a bit longer than usual. Every character has their shining moments, Shuri is at the heart of this movie but Nakia, Okoye, M'Baku and Queen Ramonda all get their shining moments and a solid story arc that is rewarding by the end, so I don't really have an issue with the movie being this long.I have some other nitpicks that are spoiler-y, so I cannot really discuss them at the time. Everyone's motivation is clear and the main story is so engaging that I didn't really care for Marvel doing their usual ""laying the ground for the future"" stuff with certain characters (without getting into details). However, I can say that Namor was a terrific character, I absolutely love what they did with him storywise and visually. He absolutely slays during the action sequences, Tenoch Huerta is a great actor that fits the role perfectly, no surprise with the spot-on Marvel casting there.This is a movie to see on the big screen, without a doubt this is the best film the MCU has delivered in the Phase 4. The scale is epic but the film feels very intimate and personal because of what happened with Chadwick. The fact that they incorporated his passing into the story beautifully was so important & crucial. Ryan Coogler is probably the best director working for Marvel right now and I'm very excited to see what he does next after this big win.8/10."
8," Extremely Emotional Movie About Loss, Legacy And Healing!
",MiroslavKyuranov,/user/ur57827313/,9 November 2022,"""Wakanda Forever"" is MCU's 30-th movie and is phenomenal! The most powerful project of Phase 4. I can not understate how masterful the score is from start to finish. There are no weak links in the cast, but I have to give a special shoutout to Angela Basset and Letitia Wright's Shuri. Letitia is quite the beating heart of this film. And Tenoch Huerta? They couldn't have found a better Namor.""Ryan Coogler's emotional movies is about loss, legacy and healing. The story is intimate, but vast with global power struggles and palace intrigue. Tenoch Huerta's Namor is a force, better than I hoped. So much can be told...The scope, the camera work, the acting, and the raw emotions on and off screen can be felt throughout! Fantastic sequel and a great movie. I knew it'd be emotional and it was. Expect your eyes to leak.Immensely powerful story of forging forward-shattering at times, but also beautifully cathartic and heartening, still cannot get over how well the film earns that title.If Chadwick could see this movie, he'll be proud as much as I am right now!"
9," Women of Will and Worth
",3xHCCH,/user/ur4294858/,9 November 2022,"Immediately prominent in this sequel are the strong stories given to its cast of talented black actresses. Angela Bassett as Ramonda, Letitia Wright as Shuri, Danai Gurira as Okoye, and Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia all give powerful performances as their roles were expanded from the original movie. Two new actresses joined their ranks -- Michaela Coel as Aneka, and Dominique Thorne as Riri, both stepping up in their hero game.The new anti-hero Namor is played by charismatic Mexican actor Tenoch Huerta. The film gave him the full backstory dating back to the 16th century, telling the origin of his incredible abilities, and even how he got his name. Even if Namor was the main antagonist of the film, Huerta played him as a passionate protector of his undersea city of Talokan and the Vibranium that sustained it. His comics name Submariner has yet to come up.Director Ryan Coogler's production design, costume design and hair and makeup teams outdid themselves in this sequel as they did not only designed Wakanda, but also Talokan. In the comics, Namor's underwater kingdom was called Atlantis, inspired by Greek mythology. However in this new film, Atlantis was given a decidedly Mesoamerican civilzation, from its architecture, costumes, language and culture.Even though lead actor and original Black Panther Chadwick Boseman had already passed away two years, Marvel made this sequel a beautiful tribute to his memory. From the specially altered opening credits all the way up to the emotionally-rich mid-credits scene, and all the scenes in between with lines that looked back on the life and extolled the nobility of T'Challa, Boseman was still very much part of this new film."
