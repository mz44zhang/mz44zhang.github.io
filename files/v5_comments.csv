Sadly liberals forgot their roots and don’t even realize where the word liberal comes from…
Liberated, liberty- meaning worthy of a free thinker, personal choice , civil liberty.
So when they go against this by supporting big government, and government mandates.
It is confusing….. it used to be “my body my choice …”
Not so much anymore.

They have turned into this SJW group of elite , rich , latte sippers , that would rather virtue signal than actually help.
They always cry systemic racism but they control the cities in which 80% of minorities live , so basically they can pass any policy, any law, any ordinance unopposed.
So why don’t they? Why do they still have the worst education systems, the highest crime, the largest homelessness and poverty rates?

It is because all they do is use the issue for votes and never fix anything.
This is why we are seeing landslide Republic victories in Dem states.
