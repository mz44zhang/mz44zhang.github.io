4," Good fights, terrible screenplay
",guilhermevieira-19536,/user/ur78398492/,1 March 2023,"The movie has good battles and fights but wasted a really good chance to be the best of the trilogy considering Kang's as the villain. Instead of focus on antman and the wasp they've chosen to highlight Cassie's character and made it extremely annoying, although the screenwriters probably wanted to show a empowered young girl. Her lines were terrible all the way.Another key point was the unknown reason why Janet said nothing about what happened to her while in the Quantum Realm? It made no sense to hide it.The movie is a mixed bag with a lot of lost opportunities, poor screenplay, good action scenes and almost no final result."
8," Marvel hunkers down
",NestorTheGreat,/user/ur54687345/,1 March 2023,"Marvel hunkers down with its Multiverse theme and begins its Phase Five chapter of the MCU with a complex story of time. As the title suggests, the majority of the film involves the quantum realm where time and space are diluted and distorted the further ""down""you go. It's 1989's Honey, I Shrunk the Kids with much more magnification, so a dust particle in that version is a floating Everest in the, umm, quantumverse. How human-like entities live and have built a bustling city there is a whole other movie! How Kang and Janet knew each other for most of her time there, and how Kang ended up there is what this film elaborates, in bright, flashy colour!But, if you take away all the gorgeous green screen, ignore the setting and background, the marvelous suprise actors that appear, and the mesmorizing portrayal of Kang, you are left with a story about a daughter and her father. Cassie Lang is all grown up now, trying to make up for all those (5) years her dad and the Pym's went missing, either from the blip or lost in the quantum realm or in jail. Her father, Antman, is her hero above all other Avengers. And a lesson he taught her in the very first Ant-Man appears in action in this film. But the fame has gone to her dad's head, and he fails to see her achievements.All the while, Janet and Kang's backstory is revealed in flashes while our heroes, separated in the universe inside our world, face one danger after another. As Janet races to save her granddaughter, who is on the run with Scott, Dr. Hank begins to see his wife in a new light as her past catches up with them.A great entry into the majestic storytelling arc of comic books to film transition. I never forget the first Comic Books that caught my attention as a child were the ones based on mythologies - which we were learning at the time in school. So the Viking myths of Thor, the monsters and trails of the Odyssey, Hercules' strength and valor, and the power of morals all told in coloured boxes and speech bubbles are now portrayed by great actors and production crews, and yet the ideas, emotions and beliefs are still there under the bright lights and big bangs! That's what elevates Marvel movies, in my opinion.The filmmakers behind these 31 superhero films have solved the puzzle of keeping seats in butts, or vice versa, as the longer these films become, the longer we can sit through them without a break- toilet or distractions of any kind (smart phones)! I found the balance between dialogue/exposition, action sequences, and comedic breaks perfectly balanced to draw my attention back to the story just as I was phasing out. Maybe I was having a good attention day, too! For a minute or two I was trying to figure out where Cassie's Kathryn Newton was recognisable from, and it was two series I'd seen: Big Little Lies and, the lacklastre Netflix 'Lord of the Flies'-type show: The Society.The soundtrack was another surprising quality that at first I thought a let down, but rejoiced at the decision to keep it less Guardians and more original soundscapes by the end of the film. It balanced the here and there elements by using the trailer's Elton John anthem during the normal ""here"", and funky or jazzy sounds in the quantum ""there"". And even in the quantum realm, it seems, bands are formed and positions taken, like a Mad Max film, and not just the costumes!A nod to AntZ and Avatar, I'm sure, were made throughout the telling of this tall tale by the Yes Man & New Girl director Peyton Reed, his now-known style seeping through the screen. As the second trailer showed, when a good dad is worth fighting for, the good daughter steps up. The man being swallowed by the ant vortex mountain and saved by his loving daughter's outreached hand says more than a million novels could express, in whichever universe you can imagine!And this brings me to what I like to call: Multiverse for Dummies. Scientifically speaking, we are vibrating, humming, and energy-filled atoms that create a type of force field around each molecule, so in essence, around our whole being. By creating energy, we are simultaneously creating our own unique snail trail and projecting our ""future"" path. As time is irrelevant, because we only count the girations of the Earth around the Sun: this sun, our sun, not another; then by scientific standards, it could very well be possible to create two diverse paths when, for example, one is faced by a dilemma. One path is created to represent option one, and another to represent option two. This theory exponentionally creates infinite probabilities and/or paths. Is the thought or the intention the creators of this energy trail? So, a multiverse for one person could be every decision and branch thereof they've ever had, from what cereal to eat to whether they should marry or not. Each branch then has branches of its own, and each one to the tiniest twig has a different version of you. And by this theory of mind creating matter, there may even be a spaghetti fingers universe or a jelly pudding one, like other films have suggested. Kang has many versions of himself spread out through infinite branches, and some of them jailed this film's version in the tiny, microscopic quantum realm. The Disney series, Loki, may shed more light on this matter.As a stepping stone towards a great many more multiverse-opening films, this feels safe. A comfortable place to begin considering the possibilities that by deleting and pasting timelines into the already complex Cinematic and Disney Series Universe, we may see a new X-men, Deadpool, Thunderbolts, Blade and, even, the Fantastic Four back for more great stories. And as we know, as one story ends, another is about to begin."
4," If I were to review the first twenty minutes of this movie
",IWasKnownAsThe1SentenceReviewer,/user/ur135925400/,1 March 2023,"If I were to review the first twenty minutes of this movie (which is more than enough to give the audience a glimpse of the very average movie they are going to have to sit through), I would write the following:Firstly, the opening scene makes no sense; the female character is aware of a possible lethal danger and yet choose to stand in the open ""waiting"" for the predator to come to her instead of hiding and aiming at it/them; just like every other action movie, the hand piece gets somehow ""knocked off"" her hand without any injury.Secondly, the ""utterly-basic"" setting for the movie's plot and the average CGI of the characters ""falling"" in the QuantumVerse is quite disappointing.But again, that's just if I stopped watching this evidently unnecessary umpteenth MCU film."
6," It's alright, nothing too good or bad
",kenc-05236,/user/ur128794129/,1 March 2023,"Idk this movie is perfectly passable for me. On its own merits it an alright movie that doesn't do anything that exciting ( except that paradoxal scene, that was good). Also like most of the mcu
lately, the humor really doesn't work for me. I get that they're already in the quantum-verse but like halfway through I kind of forgot that his power is literally skrinking/growing. It doesn't have the a scene that showcase his powers like the train or bathtub scene in the first antman movie.Also within the mcu you could have got you needed just from 2 sentences about Kang. He's a powerful conquerer that's has highly advanced tech. Also sidenote why does every character take off their helmet constantly for only like 10sec to show their fave."
8," Fun & Underrated - better than you think!
",furatceylan,/user/ur34373185/,1 March 2023,"Ant-Man & the Wasp Quantummania came a late to my region, so I had to suffer through some spoilers and people´s opinions on it.When I then went to see it, I couldn´t believe how good it actually was.I will explain without giving any spoilers:
First of all it gives a glimplse into Scotts and Hopes life without doing too much heavy lifting as some of the Disney Series did (Falcon & Winter Soldier, Hawkeye) - makes sense, since they have a lot more time to do so.Second it´s an Ant-Man movie, so it is quite fun - I had to LOL a few times in the theater.Third and most important, there is a strong story centered around Ant-Man, Hope, Cassie and most importantly - Kang.Kang is the big bad here and it is shown from different angles why he is such a good Thanos-Level-Villain.Simply put, he can control time and erase timelines - what Thanos tried to do with a single (616) universe, Kang did with countless universes, which he erased (aka. Destroyed) to achieve his goals. And he knows how powerful he is and how he can use his power to get what he wants.And here are the problems: We never get a proper explanation for WHY he does it, since when, when it all started. Sure, he thinks his variants are doing a bad job and are like chaotic little children in his eyes, but when did he start? Why did he start? What is what he lost? What´s his big motivation?I think the biggest problem of the movie can be summarized as: it is too compact to properly show the story!However, does this make a bad movie?Hardly, no, because this is Marvel. It´s just the first Phase 5 movie and there will be many to fill in the gaps, most important Loki season 2."
5," Ant-man in the Cgimania
",jack_o_hasanov_imdb,/user/ur55640799/,28 February 2023,"I was waiting for this movie, but I wasn't excited. Honestly, it was a worse movie than I thought. First of all, the movie was very boring. I am really bored. Cliches abound in the movie. The jokes weren't funny. The quantum universe wasn't bad, but plenty of cgi wasn't enjoyable to watch either. Acting was ok. I think Jonathan Majors played very well. But Kang was known as the new Tanos. I don't think it's the right decision. The character should have been written better. Kathryn Newton is introduced as the new Cassie. But I don't understand why the previous Emma Fuhrmann was not filmed. Kathryn Newton was no better. I mean, her acting was bad and I didn't like the character at all. Overall it was a disappointing movie. The after credits scenes weren't bad, but I wasn't too excited for the upcoming movies either."
4," One of the MCU's worst.
",drawlife,/user/ur14294603/,28 February 2023,"This threequel definitely belongs in the conversations of the MCU's worst entries. Truthfully it was kind of baffling to see just how bad this film is.As a comic-book geek I never really got on board with the MCU's approach to Ant-Man and Wasp, I would have much rather seen Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly play Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne instead. Even though I'm not particularly huge on the franchise, they did have this quirk with their take on humor that appealed to many (except myself) and the smaller scale missions felt refreshing to some degree. I can commend Peyton Reed and his team trying to be different, turning it into an epic Quantum Realm adventure with some serious stakes. I was all for it, and whoever cut those trailers deserves an award for making it look and feel epic, cause it absolutely does not.Whatever the characters were going through didn't exactly feel organic. It really felt half-assed. We just left Rudd's Scott Lang and his daughter Cassie with a happy reunion in AVENGERS: ENDGAME. So to see Cassie be a rebel and a sudden genius all of a sudden was just so jarring. Speaking of Cassie, Kathryn Newton is pretty horrible in the role. I don't understand why they replaced Emma Fuhrmann. In what little screen time Fuhrmann had in ENDGAME, displaying her tears of joy for her father, felt more compelling than Newton did here. Newton's delivery is so dry and her rebellious attitude comes off as a try hard. It just didn't work for me.Also a nitpick, but why is every teen a super genius now? If they were going to make her a super genius helping the Pyms create a Quantum device that communicates a signal, then why wasn't her genius at least slightly established perviously? Oh yeah and she gets a super suit and does everything the other two can do. They should have taken a breath or two to develop all this properly showcasing Scott teaching her to be Stature, mirroring Scott's journey to becoming Ant-Man.Evangeline Lilly has nothing to do in this film and her accurate haircut isn't really doing her any favors in this one. Her father Michael Douglas is just along for the ride as well and her mother Michelle Pfeiffer has a lot more to do this time around. She does the most tropey thing ever, by not revealing information that would have helped the Ant-Family WAY earlier, claiming it was ""protection.""Jonathan Majors is the only thing in the film that had any substance. Majors also commands the screen very well and felt menacing in some regard, but yet it still didn't grip me as Brolin's Thanos or Hiddleston's Loki. A lot of that has to do with how crappy the film is. MODOK is also horribly executed. I know the character is a hard sell, BUT this iteration didn't do the character any favors. The Avengers game did a WAY better job handling the character than the MCU. The change is Corey Stoll's Darren Cross is deformed into MODOK after the events of the first film. With one interaction with Cassie he chooses ""not to be a dick"" and then has a heroic death, in which it all felt so awkward and lame. Such a waste of a villain, he was basically a one-off henchmen.I feel that Peyton Reed and writer Jeff Loveness missed out on some compelling storytelling by not following through with the premise of Scott wanting to help Kang because of the promise of being given time with Cassie back. All the Quantum Realm stuff also felt small in scale. I compare it to the first THOR film where it just took place in a town, and here there was no grandness to the Quantum Realm, aside from the freedom fighters who oppose Kang's oppression. More could have been explored in that arena.I also felt there would've been more weight to the end of the film if Scott died with Kang. I knew he wasn't going to diem but I wanted it to happen with the line ""I don't have to win, we both have to lose,"" which could have been something motivates Cassie to join the young Avengers (which it looks like they're building to) moving forward. It's as if they also had a mandate to make the film more family friendly which it seemed like they tried to aim for.The kick-off to Phase 5 isn't exactly good. I feel as though they dropped the ball, but given their track record (even though it's been meh lately) I don't think the MCU would falter by the time KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS comes along, as it's their big tentpole films, but I do think the MCU needs to go back to the drawing board and figure out why Phase 1-3 worked better than it does in Phase 4-5. Currently for me, only NO WAY HOME and WAKANDA FOREVER come out on top compared to the rest.4/10."
8," ""It's never too late to stop being a dick""
",synystargates,/user/ur68024636/,28 February 2023,"I try not to be a contrarian (at least intentionally) when it comes to films and I went in with pretty mild expectations because of the ratings on this so far. But Quantumania was not only an awesome experience but I think it's easily the best Ant-Man movie!Sure there's goofy dialogue, Cassie's script was doing her NO favors. But Jonathan Majors was great as a villain and the battles actually got pretty intense. I also see everyone talking about how bad the effects were, like did we watch the same movie? I loved all the wacky elements, it's closer to what I was hoping for in Multiverse of Madness, but I'm cool with a million tiny Paul Rudds too."
3," Why are MCU movies incredibly disappointing now?
",alwaysacuriousfan,/user/ur151269174/,28 February 2023,"The movie pacing is pretty bad. The characters should have been better developed so when things happen to them, we, as audiences, actually care especially with Cassie. Who even hired her? The actress has no charisma and no chemistry with the other actors, I can't get invested in her and Scott's relationship. Her face also doesn't move? She is not very expressive and the delivery of her lines is just not landing very well. I didn't see Kang as a legitimate foe. I think he was wasted in this movie. If you didn't watch Loki, one would care even less in his character. AND WHAT WAS UP WITH THAT MOVING GIANT HEAD?! That was so weird. I could not take it (?) seriously. I didn't care much for this movie. It didn't make me feel anything for the characters except, maybe, annoyance."

7," It's nice to see something new from the comics
",justuskross,/user/ur151422201/,28 February 2023,"I think what I did right watching this movie was not informing myself at all what would be in it. This helped the storyline a lot. It's worth watching but don't expect to much of it. The visuals and effects are as good as always , if not better. I think it's very sad that some characters are introduced and the movie is making us love them and then kills them in a kind of nonchalant way. I kept going back to drink and popcorn, sadly the movie failed to suck me deep into the story. The final showdown was pretty predictable with the wasp coming to ant man's rescue.The movie also failed to answer all my questions I had about the story. Can anyone tell me if Kang is a elemental ? I believe it's very likely with his technology and outfit fitting the other elements."
5," Not an Antman Movie but more World Building
",kgprophet,/user/ur1158617/,28 February 2023,"The whispers have been turning into solid fact that audiences are getting tired of superhero movies. Why movies like Eternals failed is that there is yet another character origin story to tell. Another world to build. But that is only one problem with this movie. I liked the first two Antman films, not my favourite MCU character, but Paul Rudd definitely added decent charm into the mix. So that is another problem, lack of Paul Rudd screentime and less humour. Except for a scant witty remark here and there, this is not meant to be a fun film. Even when Bill Murray shows up for a cameo. He says his lines and tries to be provocative. But exits rather quickly and gets tossed into the pile of new characters being introduced in this movie. Which is the biggest problem with this film. Too many new characters. It is a problem with world building, here the Quantum universe, having to establish all these groups of people and their stake in things.For instance, this teenage girl was introduced and had some stake in the whole universe being destroyed or something. After the big battle at the end, they return to the girl and now the universe won't be destroyed, or something. I had literally forgotten about her. Same thing for Bill Murray, what was he all about? It goes on. There is a big group of CGI characters. The only one that stood out was a walking lava lamp who wished he had holes. Worse, the second act gets bogged down as we must have this quantum universe explained to us. ""Why didn't you mention to us that you (saw this stuff, met these people) when you were down here?"" is constantly asked of Michelle Pfeiffer's character. I think too much is made of her hiding this stuff. She didn't want to talk about it, let's move on.The last problem I had with this movie was the ugly environments that made up the Quantum universe. Like most films like this recently, things are really dark. I mean physically dark, with many things going on the big screen hidden in shadows, at night. In general, I get tired of being immersed in gloomy worlds for two hours. I thought the trend was going away from the dark themed blockbusters. I guess filmmakers prefer the dark again.So to sum up:
Too little Paul Rudd and his humour
Too many new characters
Too much world building
Too much time explaining all these things
Ugly environmentsI give it a five out of ten. I will give some stars for staying in bounds by not running over two hours, and being a mostly watchable film with no major stumbles. Oh, and I didn't care for Evangeline Lilly's new hairdo."
6," An alright movie
",bend-25191,/user/ur135348401/,28 February 2023,"As a standalone movie, it's a fun family friendly flick, you can watch it as you come home from work, then go to bed and forget about it in the morning.The problem is that this is the introduction of the next big bad in the MCU, and as such it's just a big disappointment. It feels like a DC movie parodying the MCU instead of an actual MCU installment.It's just so boring and safe. Despite the avenger-level stakes, it just feels like nothing is ever happening.It takes the most interesting parts of the MCU movie formula and forgets about it, leaving only the annoying parts.I just hope the next time we see Kang the Conqueror he's in a more interesting movie."
3," Movie full of wasted potential and useless gags
",Doctor_Dafaria,/user/ur147974200/,28 February 2023,"It's clear that a lot of studio influence and producers has heavily influenced this script where a movie that meant to upstart the saga's main villain, ended underplaying the stakes by making it a generic guardians of the galaxy rip off with humorless gags and middle school tier level writing that an average mediocre English teacher can see through.Let's start with the characters, the main villain Kang is played quite well but clashes with the tones that the film portrays, Kang is meant to be intimidating and merciless which clashes with the absurdist humor this film has established within the first act. Antman is as good as always and there isn't much to go over, Hank Pym (the original antman) has virtually nothing to do in this movie but to act like the ""grumpy grandpa"" character whose just bewildered all the time, are you kidding me? You got the great Michael Douglas who played many great roles yet you basically reduced him to some crappy Rick and Morty gag that isn't funny in the first place. Now we get into the deeper negatives, Janet's character is basically some mysterious character that really doesn't make sense in the grand scheme of things, why didn't she talk about what was in the Quantime realm? Even if she didn't want to talk about Kang because she was intimidated but she could of at least discuss that there is another subatomic world that is best to be left alone, why are we using the ""we talk about this later"" clutch to create fake melodrama, what a terrible plot device! Her whole gag that she had a ""relationship"" with the Bill Murry character was a complete waste of time that could be replace by some other backstabbing goon, it felt like I was watching a modern star wars movie by having these space bars and aliens that are too silly to be taken seriously. Cassie is such a wasted character, she is meant to be like a legacy hero, but she has little to no character development. How many times are you going to keep recasting Cassie's character as this is the third time you did this, the first excuse marvel did is because ""no one knew this actress hence why we recast"" and now what's the narrative now Marvel? I don't blame any of the actresses that played Cassie but I can tell that none of the writers know how to write female characters because they follow the tropes and stereotypes you see in a male gaze film where they're incompetent and need a man to save the day, except there is no obvious sexism in the clothing that's the only difference. Bad way to start off your Phase 5 series!The plot is dumb, the aesthetics and design infuriate me because it's all a mix of modern marvel aesthetic, modern Star Wars, and that boring film Strange World Disney film where all the character design of aliens are reduced to gags and ""zany"" humor that completely stops the film for no good reason. I hate how alien characters are reduced to gags yet they expect you care about their oppression that Kang has inflicted on them. Wrong! One of the main things that make you feel bad about a certain group of people or being is their humanity, how their culture act, how they live and what issues they face during economically so you feel scared or angry that you see them suffer; but none of the film has that as they're reduced to Rick and Morty gags! What a waste of time and resources!I dont have that ""superhero fatigue"" or whatever the critics have, but people are tired of lazy writing and forced jokes that ruins the tone of the movie, it's ok to joke but when it undermines the entire movie, it becomes a problem. If the end credits are more interesting than the actual movie, you have failed to catch the audience's interest!"

The only thing that could have made it more so was if they had been sucked into a tv and had been cartoons the entire time (which I suppose they were as it was actually all animated by computer artists).I felt I had to rate high to overcompensate for unnecessarily harsh reviews. But in all honest it basically was a 10/10 for an Ant-Man movie. For a regular Marvel movie? 7/10. I could have dealt with a little more character growth from people other than Scott, Cassie, Kang, and Janet though (most the first two). That being said Jonathan Majors as Kang is the star of the show. He killed it.Ps. I want psychic Chidi in another Marvel Movie."

3," One of Marvel's worst
",skjoe-1,/user/ur20011798/,28 February 2023,"Antman and the Wasp: Quantumania is another cookie cutter, bland, green screen borefest that reeks of poor writing and rushed special effects.As a huge fan of marvel and their movies I was massively disappointed with the post-endgame content. Gone are complex, well written characters and everyone appears to have been replaced with subpar variants. Dr Strange 2 was a huge missed opportunity and Thor 4 was almost embarrassing. Then along comes the next Ant-man film.The first 2 Ant-man movies were fun, heist style movies with low stakes and great humour. The true spectacle of them both was watching the heroes shrink down and interact with everyday objects.It would be appropriate to rename this movie Janet Van Dyne: Quantumania. The film begins with her and most of the plot revolves around her, plus she has an insane amount of screen time. Hope and Hank have barely any screen time and literally nothing to do for 90% of this film.My first doubts began at the start of the movie. After we catch up with Scott Lang living his everyday good life, we get introduced to his daughter Cassie. Not only is her performance in this movie so wooden and bland, they've turned her into some stubborn activist constantly talking down to her father. (Is this character really someone girls can look up to and be inspired by?)At a dinner scene, Scott mentions that he saved the universe and everyone downplays this as if it's nothing. Then Hank explains that Cassie has made a sub-atomic quantum signal machine, in her basement. I mean of course she has. Another strong independent female who is perfect and can do everything straight away.Then the machine breaks and sucks everyone into the quantum realm. I mean it was unplugged then it came back but I understand this mcguffin is just a lazy plot device to get our characters into the quantum universe.Then we get overload of green screen. What could of been a visually striking and completely fascinating world of creative beauty just feels so bland and uninspired.Scott and Cassie bump into some tribes of survivors and Hope, Hank and Janet go on a hunt to find a device we understand Kang wants.Well I am here let's talk about Kang. Jonathon Majors puts in a decent performance and has some potential but he's wasted here. We are told so many times how powerful and terrifying Kang is. How he is dangerous, how he can wipe out timelines and destroy universes but they really don't follow the show don't tell rule here.What proceeds next is some mindless, boring expedition through the quantum realm. Split between meeting random alien characters who we really can't care about and a pointless Bill Murray cameo. Let me talk about the humour in this movie, there is none. There isn't even an attempt. My cinema was packed and completely silent. Thor love and thunder had too many jokes that didn't land but at least it tried and it could muster a chuckle out of me. Ant-man had no humour at all. Even Paul Rudd, who has plenty of comedy move experience, struggles to work with the material here.Then we have the movies biggest embarrassment; Modok. Not the sadistic, genius, supervillain from the comics but Yellowjacket from the first movie is back and turned onto one of the worse cgi villains I have ever seen. A constant (unfunny) joke and so pointless and unthreatening in this film.The films final act ends in a huge messy cgi battle among Kangs troops and the aliens we saw earlier. This blurry, unbearable mash of special effects and random characters we don't care about it is where I really struggled to stay invested.Cassie not only has her own suit and can control it but helps Scott go toe to toe with Kang. Not only does Kang never use his powers (the ones he used on the cannon fodder aliens earlier) but he even makes light of wiping out the avengers multiple times in the past. Yet he struggles against Ant-man.Thanos was teased for years as this huge threat. When we first see him in infinity war, he has defeated Thor and beats Hulk in a fight, which was like a benchmark of strength. Plus his plans and powers are clear and understandable.Kangs powers in this movie are firing blue beams and producing a shield. That is it. His motives? He wants to destroy timelines. Why? Don't know. I guess if you have an alternate version of yourself your first thought is to destroy the timeline?How can you plan your next phase of films based on such a weak, pointless and uninteresting villian?When the movie ends no one has changed, no one has had any character development and it makes the film seem pointless.Ultimately it's a bland, mess of a movie. Lacking creativity and any distinct style. No memorable scenes. Forgetful score and awful writing. I wouldn't even recommend watching it for free."
4," My dreams have died
",markleachsa-1,/user/ur4858694/,27 February 2023,"My first reaction: hang on, physics doesn't work like that. But I put that aside, as I wanted so, so badly to like this movie. Paul Rudd is an amusing and likeable chap, even though the jokes and dialogue between him and his quantam-travelling family were old and heavy and stale, without a spark of spontaneity.Evangeline Lilly is stunning, even on a bad day. But then, she must have had a series of awful days, because they managed to turn the astonishing Elven captain from the Hobbit, into a frumpy librarian and then punish her by restricting her dialogue to a few meaningless responses.Michael Douglas looked thoroughly bored and if I hadn't caught dollar signs in his eyes now and again, I would have thought he'd been blackmailed into returning to this franchise.Kang was played by a wooden puppet as far as I could tell, although I couldn't see the strings, so the effects department covered those up well. Good for them. An award please!Katherine Newton who played Rudd's grown-up daughter did shine with enthusiasm as did some of the side characters. But the plot was old and full of cobwebs from other movies: The Return of the Jedi, Braveheart, Lawrence of Arabia and every other movie where a downtrodden people are prodded into revolution. I kept looking for an Ewok to appear, but sadly no, unless I missed them in the crowd of other creatures that had little, if anything, in common.It was big on effects in order to disguise that it was poor on story, so if all you are looking for is fast-moving eye-candy, then this is the one for you.Perhaps the one bright spot was the determined professionalism of Michelle Pfeiffer, who somehow managed to look and act younger and more dynamic than her 'daughter'.If it wasn't for her, I would have wandered out of this tired rehash of old plots halfway through, instead of doing that with ten minutes to go. Somehow it was more interesting to go and watch people going in and out of the various screens than continue to the end. 4/10."
8," Darker tone and more intense than the first two films
",ostlerb-02853,/user/ur126612256/,27 February 2023,"Quantumania finally moves on from the ""ex con who can't get a job"" narrative to a much more competent version of Scott Long and a fresh, original story that hasn't already been impacted by the events of other movies. Frankly, I'm glad that the movie was much different than the first two. I never really felt any suspense or excitement in those.The tone of the series gets a much needed makeover. The comedy is minimal, the suspense is much higher, and the producers finally found the right music to illustrate the mood. Best of all, Scott finally transforms himself from the clumsy, annoying character he used to be to the serious, valiant fighter that I've waited 8 years for.I wasn't a fan of all the goofy, CGI characters that were introduced. And as usual, the writers attempted to inject comedy where it simply doesn't fit. In fact, the first 15 minutes are actually very cringy. Since I can't give it a 7.5 rating, I'm rounding up to 8. In reality, it's a 7.5 for me."
8," Actually, this is really entertaining! Just enjoy.
",gcsman,/user/ur66541531/,27 February 2023,"I see that some reviewer on the web referred to this as Marvel's version of Star Wars. In fact I think there's a lot to that. Loads of weird creatures, a big cast, an evil empire and a rebel alliance, armies of identical storm troopers, and a huge CGI blast that is probably Marvel's biggest yet. This is like Star Wars in the same way that Shang-Chi: The Legend of the Ten Rings was like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.So this is the way they decided to introduce Kang full-on (after a short lead-in on the Loki streaming series) and generally I'm OK with it. Half an hour in to the show I really started to enjoy the ride. (More so, in fact, than I like any of the Star Wars series, which are undeniably splashy but have semi-random plots and dialog aimed at 8 year olds.)I want to give credit to the cast, more than I usually do. The ensemble nature of it works most of the time really well. The 'nuclear family' with Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne, daughter Hope, and Scott and Cassie Lang were all played just fine by Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Evangeline Lilly, Paul Rudd, and Kathryn Newton. Though Scott is the headliner, I was pleasantly surprised by how much work they gave to Michelle Pfeiffer and Kathryn Newton -- they rock. If anyone was sidelined a bit it was Lilly (really guys? She's in the title after all). Jonathan Majors is duly impressive as Kang, playing a wildly different version of him than He Who Remains who we saw in Loki. Katy O'Brian and William Jackson Harper are great as rebel leaders with distinctive abilities and make the most of their screen time. And Bill Murray ...Despite the long parade of action scenes and dialog that is just enough to understand what's going on, it flows well from end to end. With short 'bookend' sections in our everyday world, everything takes place in the Quantum Realm. It's all very colorful and imaginative at a level we didn't even see in Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness.But just a final caveat: if this was *really* a quantum realm in the true physics sense, I probably don't need to say that it wouldn't look anything like this. The real thing? Absolutely anything we take for granted in the everyday world, like, I don't know, gravity? Structures? Sound and air? Light? Dialog? Nonexistent. Objects aren't even defined, they are just probability clouds. So this is all crazy in the same sense as our sci-fi settings like Captain Marvel, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Star Wars too, violate basic principles by using FTL space travel and simultaneity.But I guess that's not the point. This is storytelling and I enjoyed watching this story."
8," Compared to ""Love and Thunder"" - it's a masterpiece
",captainzoath,/user/ur53526034/,27 February 2023,"I went into this movie with very very low expectations after the last debacle of love and thunder. I had read the reviews and saw that there was a lot of poor comments about the movie. I decide to go see it on my own again with very low expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised - the graphics are amazing.I felt like the movie had a good flow with a good message and I have heard others say that they felt like it was all about Kong but I didn't really get it that way I really enjoyed some of the humor between Ant-man and the rest of the cast - Douglas always does a really good job.The only irritating character to me in the whole movie was Ant-man's daughter - nowadays every teenage girl is smarter than their dad and their dad is some kind of bumbling buffoon who has to learn through her wise examples."
1," Boring and characters have no brain
",hccontreras-66897,/user/ur127614462/,27 February 2023,"I was sooooooo borrrrrrred during this whole movie. Plot was super dumb. I hate when movies make characters dumb just so that they have a reason to move the plot forward, oh! And also,...how covinient and how many coincidences happen just make everything so.... Tidy! Ha ha NOT!I saw so many negative reviews on this, i figured id give it a shot, but yes, not a good movie. I feel bad for. Paul Rudd. I like him as an actor and he did his best as the Ant Man character but... Plot wise and just all the mess around it... It's just sad and boring. FANCY SPECIAL EEFECTS DON'T AUTOMATICALLY MAKE A GOOD MOVIE!! Character development and thoughtful interactions are what makes movies great!"
6," Loosing it's game
",peetjepitstra,/user/ur27315744/,27 February 2023,"After a joyfull watch in the theather with some laughs this is another Marvel movie that maybe proves this universe is loosing it's game.As usual the movie starts with Paul Rudd, making the best of it, even with the clear precence of being the less known Avenger. Him doing his thing however keeps it fun to watch. Now, with his daughter joining the ""family business"" the movie tries to give a message how fathers love thair daughters. And all that in a giant small universe witch brings a couple of laughable characters...and Kang. However plaid well the character somehow just not delivers the new big bad guy. The other main character are there when needed and give some backgroundstory. At the end it feels like there is a lot but misses the grasp."
7," Usual marvel movie
",rajvignesh-60140,/user/ur144838273/,27 February 2023,"This has been a usual marvel movie with all the commercial elements, a simple story with all techs and depth in that. The whole ant family has performed very well. It has fights talks etc. The usual ant man movie things with some humour to be kudos. It could have been different a bit but the movie has been reall usual nothing new. The one thing was kang , oh boy he is just master of conquerer. But such a strong villain been killed in a snap. But i hope something more to come in the future. Kang will return with bang. I am supporting a antogonist for the first time. Paul actually he is been a side stay, kang and janet being the main role played . But he just did justice to the role. It was entirely dominated by kang. As always a happy end to the movie. The main attraction in the post credit never miss it to watch it. Its really mindblowing, i dont want to spoil it. Please do watch it in theaters. A good start to phase 5."
7," Better than expected.
",Eblogary,/user/ur148550697/,27 February 2023,"I have watched all of the phase 4, and it is much better than anything released in the previous phase. The acting of Jonathan Majors was fabulous. Every scene of Kang felt menacing. The movie established Kang as the big villain of MCU pretty well.However, the potential of Wasp and MODOK was wasted as they received very little run time. MODOK was just a comedy relief character. VFX were great. The MODOK with big head looked goofy but that's how it should look like. The MODOK did not look unrealistic unlike the floating head in Thor 4.There were some plot-holes, and logical mistakes but overall it was fun, as comic book movies should be. It had some good jokes, but they did not feel unnecessary like the jokes in Thor 4. In comparison with Thor 4, and Doctor Strange 2, it was a much better movie."
6," Almost very good, just missed the mark
",edwardfinan,/user/ur113364866/,27 February 2023,"Making a trilogy for a character not many knew until Civil War sounds like a bad idea, but they proved us wrong. Marvel made this character mainstream and Rudd has looked like one of their best fits for their characters. On the contrary, this movie is the least enjoyable out of the trilogy, even with an outstanding performance from Rudd and Jonathan Majors. The writing is lazy. VFX are fantastic and really almost save the film. Cassie is extremely one dimensional and has the bulk of my troubles with the writing. Definitely one of the weakest Marvel movies to date, just edging out Eternals, Thor: The Dark World, and Black Widow. MODOK's story is actually enjoyable until the back half of the movie. Overall, expected a lot more, and a bit of a disappointment."
6," Big Ideas, Mediocre Results
",CutlasSaber,/user/ur156856433/,27 February 2023,"So I guess this movies supposed to be the start of MCU's Phase 5, and we'll, it's a pretty weak start, but a start to something nonetheless.To be honest there isn't much I can say about this film apart from how disappointed I am, but it's not the worst film the MCU has produced either, there's still a lot of stuff I genuinely enjoyed here, and I will gladly give credit when credit is due by saying what I liked about this film first..-I love what this film was going for, in fact the wackiness that a lot of people may complain about is.-Kang was pretty cool too, he had a lot of very badass scenes for sure, though I do feel like the film could've done better fleshing him out, but seeing how he's supposed to be the main villain in the Multiverse Saga I'm staying optimistic that Kang will get his proper development in future Marvel projects, and with Loki's season 2 I have my hopes up that we'll get exactly that.-Visuals aren't great, but they aren't bad either (except for MODOK, I don't think the developers were doing him any favors). And the only reason I'm counting this as a good thing is because Phase 4 stood more on quantity over quality, and that's one of the main reasons why I think Phase 4 is the worst phase in the MCU right now, but I still think Marvel needs to give there developers time to actually get things done properly, and it seems like we're slowly getting there, but I still don't think it's enough as of right now. Maybe the visuals will get worse in this phase, but as of now I don't think it's too bad in this film.Well will you look at that, I've run out of positive things to say. Alright now with that out of the way let's get down to the REAL stuff;My first complaint is why the actual heck is the action in this movie so boring? Like yo until the end we get literally nothing. With a mediocre story like this, why not have some really cool action sequences to make up for it? Marvel has had some amazing action sequences throughout the years. Take Thor: Love and Thunder for example, I never really liked that movie all too well, but at least there was action to make me enjoy it. But nah, I guess Marvel thought we'd all love to see some high-tech guards get knocked out every time Kang leaves the room. Though I will admit that the action does start to improve in the third act of the movie, but I still think the story went a little too simple with the action scenes. They went so insanity cheap with the action sequences that I don't even know why this film even has 'Action' as their main genre at this point.Now for the character that almost made me want to leave the theater entirely, I introduce to you MODOK. This Mental Organism makes sense why it's Designed Only for Killing, as how this character makes me want to kill myself. Yes I'm being dramatic of course, but for real though, this character serves no purpose in this film other than being a punching bag for every living character in this film, this guys seriously a joke, and not a funny one might I mention. I'm not too familiar with MODOK in the comics, but I'm pretty sure he's supposed to be a threatening killing machine, and he's none of those things as he barely even kills in this film, in fact he's had many opportunities to kill Casie and fails to do so, and this is an issue because he's commanded to murder her at one point in the film. Take MODOK from this film entirely and nothing changes, in fact you'd be doing this film justice by him not being around.Overall, this film was made entirely to set up for Loki season 2 and The Kang Dynasty, and that's basically it. Sure, it's watchable and still an enjoyable ride, but really serves no other purpose in the MCU than to set up for future projects. This film had so much potential and I really wished it could have been better, and I just know there's a timeline out there somewhere that lived up to my expectations.TL;DR: A great film for setting up other projects, but not so well as a stand-alone movie."
4," Disney is a sinking ship and they are taking MARVEL with them
",benjamindmilbourne,/user/ur161280154/,27 February 2023,"This movie was just like every other MARVEL movie recently. Just ok. There were a few laughs but it was in between awkward acting where it seemed the actors were being held at gunpoint and confusing plot lines and holes. I wish I would've just waited for it to go on Disney+ because it was not worth my money going to the theater. The fun part was being at the movies and not the movie itself. It's just a recycled plot line with no real meaning other than a cash grab for Disney knowing all their loyal fans will go see it just because it's a new MARVEL movie. They don't have to worry about it actually being good and it really wasn't. Like I said
Just ok."
4," Annoyed this was so cookie cutter.
",happyjam,/user/ur13703739/,27 February 2023,"About 20 min in I found myself growing not only bored, but annoyed at how lazy the writing and creativity was in this film.The dialog- bad to awful and just plain cookie cutter.The characters- fill in the blank characters. Quirky alien type, check. Warrior just fighting for her people, check. Annoying Daughter who gives the hero a reason to fight, check. Cardboard cut out of a love interest, check. Mysterious character who knows what's really going on, but never seems to have the time to divulge some possibly life saving information, but doesn't (because ""there's no time!!!"") until the plot calls for it, check. Villain with terrifying powers he never seems to use on the main heroes, but kills just about every side character, check. Also Villain with obscure motivations that never come into the light, but just trust us he's really eeeevillll!!! Chhhheck.I enjoyed the previous Ant Man films, but this was just so poorly written and the story so lazily told that I couldn't muster up any concern for any of the characters. At. All. Just so not good. Is this really Marvel?! What happened!!? So much wasted potential."
5," Actualy saw it twice just to be sure
",olderguy,/user/ur7888107/,27 February 2023,"Like watching the middle part of a movie that's out of synch with the first and who knows how it will fit the the next.Also wondering why everyone was running around in the last act with all the firing and action...yet nobody activates their suits..just run around looking scared and shell shocked instead of doing what they do later..activate the suits and turn the tide. Wish they had transitioned to activating sooner with less running. Guess all the adrenalin stopped their brains from reacting until the right amount of time running happened.Seems like Wasp is almost used as a filler. Wish her role had more definition and. Dan and the ants sorta slid in at the end after laying no foundation between one sentence about the ant farm at the beginning and suddlenly taking over everything in the last few minutes.Guess they want us to wait for the next installment to find out why Kang was kicked out...and after seeing all the variations in the final teaser, how bad could it be after seeing that wild collecttion of Kang clones..they all looked equally evil."
7," Intro to Phase 5
",adrri0n,/user/ur155195526/,27 February 2023,"It was good. It's not trying too hard to be any more than it needs to be. It's an introductory film to Phase 5. Honestly, this movie got bombed with bad reviews of people who forget this movie is a Marvel movie. It's not gonna be a cinematic masterpiece. I was entertained, so I liked it. It wasn't special and there are certainly better Marvel movies. But it's a good introduction to what is coming up next. This movie did what it needed to do, get us excited for Phase 5. Remember, people who didn't like this film are still gonna come back and watch every upcoming Marvel film from Phase 5 and beyond. While it does have a predictable and tame story, 90% of movies are predictable anyway. We don't watch movies for the ending, we watch them for what leads up to it. It's an enjoyable superhero film that people will come back to appreciate if Phase 5 gets it right."
1," So bad, it's offensive
",jpandradealmeida,/user/ur24596199/,27 February 2023,"This film was an utter disaster. The confusing and farfetched plot was compounded by terrible acting and cheesy dialogue.A ridiculous star wars like aesthetics in the quantum realm?! Give me a break.The special effects were lackluster. The climax??? Was incredibly anticlimactic and left me feeling disappointed. I would not recommend this film to anyone. Save your time and money and watch something else instead.Avoid at all costs and watch something that won't make you regret wasting your time. The first movie was OK...A low point for Marvel. I just didn't leave the movie theater because of my son, ... who verbalized ""what a crazy film""..."
6," Kang and the Janet Van Dyne: Quantumania - There fixed the title for you
",fvwwnyb,/user/ur158916843/,27 February 2023,"I didn't understand why this film is called Antman and the Wasp when the primary focus of the plot was on Kang and the life of Janet Van Dyne in the Quantum realm. Rest of the characters like the Antman, Wasp, Pym were there just to support.Well while Antman got some screen time and action scenes (very poor ones), Wasp almost got nothing. Kang's character was good and supposed to be the next big challenge for the Avengers. Although he portrayed his character well, he felt nowhere as near as Thanos.I miss the good old days when a Marvel film was named after some character, they focused on that character. At this point they all feel like different shades of the Guardian of the Galaxies. Also, is it really necessary to introduce humor into every scene? It takes away from the seriousness from an intense or emotional scene.The only positive is the visual of the Quantum world."

ACTION!It did help that we enjoyed this movie in 4DX.I hope you read this and decide to watch this movie with an open mind and enjoy it as I did.FOR THE LITTE GUY/ANT."
9," A pure science-fiction adventure
",darkreignn,/user/ur33659536/,26 February 2023,"Surprise! I really enjoyed this movie, which was surprising as it seems to be getting lambasted by critics and audiences alike. And on one hand, I can understand; people are getting superhero fatigue, and Ant-Man never was the most popular character out there. On the other hand, this third entry in the ""Ant-Man"" series of films is a science-fiction adventure that I, for one, couldn't get enough of.If you're a fan of straight up sci-fi, I honestly can't imagine how you wouldn't enjoy this movie; virtually from beginning to end, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is an exercise in engaging world building and incredible visuals - on a purely visual aspect this movie is a 10 out of 10; the movie takes viewers through a world - a universe - that is so interesting to look at that I found myself almost jaw-dropped for 90% of this film's runtime. But of course, great visuals can only take a movie so far.Luckily, ""Quantumania"" delivers on pretty much every other aspect as well. With fantastic chemistry between its main characters, the film is a sheer delight to watch in terms of characterization and character interaction. Paul Rudd is charismatic as usual, but I was even more impressed with Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Kathryn Newton; you'd think the ridiculous subject matter would lead to ridiculous performances, but they're all bringing their A-game here, which was unexpected but appreciated. Now I know what you're thinking: ""How was Jonathan Majors?"" Let's talk about it.Introducing a new villain, Kang the Conqueror, ""Quantumania"" is apparently setting up the next biggest Marvel baddie. And while I found Kang to have a lot of potential, I wasn't particularly impressed with his villainy here, as much as I enjoyed Majors in the role. While Majors adds a cold menace to the character, I found a lot of Kang's dialogue to be trite and evil for the sake of being evil. While his initial introduction is more nuanced, the film foregoes that, and instead makes the character extremely one dimensional. That said, I did feel as if he was a worthy enough opponent in this movie, and I am interested to see the future development of this character.If you're going to see an MCU movie, you most likely care about the action; while ""Quantumania"" didn't have a ton of action in it (the movie focuses more on adventure than action), the action it did have satisfied me. While the action is extremely CGI heavy for the most part, I found it exciting in its sci-fi centricity - it really felt like I was watching a ""Star Trek"" movie, and while some people may not like that, I absolutely loved it.Overall, I had a fantastic time with this movie. Audiences seem to be turning on Ant-Man and on the MCU in general, but I found this to be a refreshing take on the genre with its emphasis on pure science-fiction adventure. You may not enjoy this as much as I did, but if you're a Marvel fan, you owe it to yourself to give this a watch."
6," Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania review:
",fiscker23ngl,/user/ur162765745/,26 February 2023,"It is a film that meets, beyond some gaps in the script, very entertaining without the need to explode in very childish humor and although it lasts two hours it seems long to me, on the other hand I consider little time for everything that it is trying to explain. Jonathan Majors is incredible as Kang, who, although he doesn't have all the leading role expected of him, fulfills his character very well and I hope to see him in action in the future. Kathryn Newton is a good change from the Cassie actress who has a good performance and a lot of lead alongside Jannet who plays a very important role in the film: Paul Rudd executes his character well in which he realizes that he does not spend much time with his daughter, and is forced to work with Kang to have a way out of the quantum realm. There are characters that do not have as much prominence as expected and that in themselves do not contribute much to the plot and some only serve as a fun element. There are also characters that I didn't like the way they were treated, like Modok, who looks horrible compared to the one in the comics, he's a very good character that Marvel didn't know how to deal with.It's not an Avengers Infinity War level movie, but it's fine to pass the time and start the new saga apart from a questionable CGI in some scenes in which the green screen is more than obvious, and an ending that didn't quite convince me for several reasons.In short, I give it a 6/10, it's a movie that meets, but I expected more."
8," A damn entertaining movie
",fillosetti,/user/ur158175831/,26 February 2023,"After reading many reviews of this movie, mostly negative, I expected much worse. And instead, despite its obvious flaws, it turned out to be a truly enjoyable and entertaining movie, pleasant to follow and never boring.But let's go in order, as I said there are some flaws: I didn't perceive Jonathan Majors' Kang as a great threat, as the film instead would like to pass off. Which isn't a good thing, considering he'll be the main villain of Phase 5. The CGI, while not deeming it as awful as many have described it, is up and down, has truly impressive moments and ""meh"" moments. Modok is perhaps the only element with truly terrible CGI. In addition, I found some of the dialogues quite senseless, and sometimes almost ridiculous.But apart from all these evident flaws, I had a lot of fun watching this movie, and in my opinion it totally achieved its goal. The main purpose of a cinecomic is to entertain the viewer, and as a viewer I felt entertained throughout. So I don't feel like complaining so much. I conclude by saying that I completely understand who didn't like this film, but I liked it, I'm sorry."
6," Didn't hate it, but average at best.
",fredschaefer-406-623204,/user/ur34623725/,26 February 2023,"When it comes to any comic book film now, I like to go see them cold, avoiding any and all reviews and spoilers so I can have as much of an unbiased view as possible going in. This is true for both the MCU and the DCEU, and I've found it works pretty well for me. I followed this same practice with ANT MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA. The story picks up with Scott Lang enjoying life after the events of AVENGERS: EDDGAME (which seem like a long time ago now) reconnecting with his teenage daughter Cassie, romancing Hope Van Dyne (aka The Wasp), and working with her parents, scientists Hank Pym and his wife Janet. Scott's written a book, and is taking to the life of being celebrity. But in short order, Scott and his extended family are shrunk back down into the microverse, a hostile world where they must find a MacGuffin that will return them to their home. They also must keep said MacGuffin from falling into the hands of the story's main villain, Kang the Conqueror, a legacy Marvel bad guy. Kang is a time traveling multi-dimensional tyrant, bent on proving himself against all of existence who was exiled to the Quantum Realm and would very much like to reconnect with Janet who played a very important role preventing him from escaping during the years she spent in the microverse, and who hid the MacGuffin away where Kang couldn't find it. There is much chasing and hiding, capturing and escaping, in the progress of the story, ending in a big set piece battle between good and evil, where the latter is on the verge of destroying all the worlds as we know them if he is not stopped.One thing this movie got right is one of the essentials: a great super villain. In Jonathan Majors' hands, Kang is a Thanos level antagonist. He's smart, capable of being charming, but able to turn on a dime and be chilling in his cruelty. The biggest selling point of this film is the intro of Kang, who is slated to play a big role in the MCU going forward, and Majors alone makes QUANUMANIA worth seeing. Also, this movie looks great and uses CGI well to create an alien world, filled with bizarre looking creatures and strange landscapes. I'm very critical of films that are too dependent on CGI, but this one isn't one of them. Michelle Pfeiffer, as Janet Van Dyne, has still got it: a striking beauty with big star screen presence. Michael Douglas, as her husband Hank, had not lost it either, reminding us why he was such a big deal back in the day. Paul Rudd has lost none of his charm; I think Scott Lang will be his signature character. I especially like the sequence where the endlessly multiple Scotts must try to find a way to reach the power core and retrieve it.But overall, I must say that ultimately, QUANTUMANIA is average at best. I don't think Jeff Loveness, a writer from RICK AND MORTY, is the best guy a for comic book film. The humor doesn't always work, and some of the character development, especially turning Cassie into a resentful teen, seems done only to create some plot tension. The dialogue is filled with trite lines we've heard in hundreds of films before-I never want to see the hero in a superhero ever again stand over the super villain at the seeming end of the battle and say, ""It's over."" To call Peyton Reed's direction unimaginative is being kind-there's not one plot turn in this film we haven't seen before in other MCU movies, and can't see coming this time. There are other nits to pick that range to the downright annoying. On the comic book page, the villain MODOK is truly sinister and grotesque looking, and that is where he should have stayed. Some things just don't translate well to the movie screen no matter how sophisticated the CGI. And the way they used one of Marvel's most iconic monsters in this film is a travesty. And why is Bill Murray even in this movie besides the fact that he just wanted to be part of the MCU. From the way his one scene is shot, I don't know if he was even on the set with Rudd, Douglas, Pfeiffer and the rest the cast at the same time. Was I the only one who hoped we might see The Micronauts show up in the Quantum realm? I know Marvel doesn't have the rights to those characters anymore, but just the same, it would have been nice.I liked QUANTUMANIA better than the last two MCU films-WANKANDA FOREVER and THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER, but not by much. It feels like the MCU has struck out for the third time and this is a problem going forward. Whatever the Russo brothers, James Gunn, and Jon Favreau, brought seems to have left with them. We still have the third GUARDIANS film coming, but after that... Time to go find some fresh talent that understands what makes comic book films work.There is a mid-credits and end-credits scene, the first setting up the character of Kang to be a Big Bad in future projects, and second features two characters from one of the streaming series that didn't appear in QUANTUMANIA, but whose presence might have helped. Neither one exactly left me wanting to know more; what I really want to see is some sign of the Fantastic Four and the X-Men, and when we will see them in the MCU."

However, we are talking about very low expectations at the start, which unfortunately are not the same as they were years ago.Often in the film the characters make stupid choices, with jokes often out of context and a very simple plot, more than predictable. The film should be called ""Kang: Quantumania"", since the whole plot revolves around him and all the other characters are used to introduce them.For the rest, apart from the humiliating CGI of M. O. D. O. K, it is a very classic and even enjoyable film, if you can think of nothing from the narrative point of view. As reported in the title, it is now in the average of today's MCU movies, sadly."
6," Doesn't seem to be a problem.
",weh-54171,/user/ur162227362/,26 February 2023,"So first up, the pros;
the CGI was good, quiet a colorful movie and was good to look at when watching in 3D. The sounddesign was cool but nothing revolutionary. The characters where good portraied and there were some funny bits, like when M. O. D. O. K appeared. The scene with the Ants attacking Kang was kinda scary, but also seemed out of the blue.Now to the cons which we'll dive deeper into;
the story was just predictable, I had a little bit of »Rise of Skywalker« -Vibes, as the ""Rebelion"" takes on the Spacetroopers which is not too great. There are the typical silly jokes you'd expect in a MARVEL-movie.The picture of the almighty Kang wasn't incredibly good portraied: sometimes it seemed like he was unstoppable, then he seemed like he was super weak - just not really an Avengers-kind-of-problem.Kang could've killed Antman easily but the plot armor was thic which made it seem lazy and the Council of Kangs in the end looked rather goofy than intimidating.Klling M. O. D. O. K was just an uninteresting turn of the events and overall I'm wondering about the future of this Phase.Generous 6/10, better than She-Hulk."
6," Mediocre start to the MCU Phase 5
",primenumberone,/user/ur73118543/,26 February 2023,"An enjoyable romp, but nothing you haven't seen before. Personally, I found the CGI overwhelming and distracting from any of the emotional heart of the story.Jonathan Majors is an interesting choice for Kang and is the redeeming performance in this latest MCU presentation as everyone else dials in their performances, which is a pity as Paul Rudd especially, doesn't have a huge amount to do, as usually he's the heart and soul of the story, and usually you're on that journey with him. But this is more about Michelle Pfieffer's character and sheds some light on her previous extended time in the quantum zone.All in all, a fair movie, not the best Ant-Man movie but it's a must watch in terms of Kang's story."
9," Jonathan Majors kills it has Kang
",DarkVulcan29,/user/ur4593705/,26 February 2023,"The first two Ant Man movies the quantum realm was talked about, but in Quantumania we now see it first hand. Scott and family find themselves pulled into the quantum realm, only to discover it's also another universe, and Janets past quickly comes back to haunt her.Jonathan Majors really blew me away has the villian Kang, givin a type Darth Vader like performance, even with his calmness you clearly see the insanity in him. Paul Rudd once again brings likable comic charm, Michael Douglas was good, so was Evanegline Lilly and Michelle Pfieffer. Sometimes Kathryn Newton was annoying , but other times she was good. The effects are awesome, I love the star wars like adventure."
6," Wake up Marvel!
",skea-76723,/user/ur67993173/,26 February 2023,"As a huge Marvel fan, and a person who probably won't be objective with MCU, I couldn't give this film bigger rate unfortinatelly. It had really great potential and expectations were pretty high for a starter movie of a new phase, but final product was only basic. Story and it's development were good, I can not find some obvious bad things, but for a franchise as big as MCU is, this must be better, it's not an option any more. Standards were set pretty high with movies like Infinity War and Endgame and from that moment there were not a move that left me speachless and hyped the way I want to be after watching Marvel. Thematic and side characters are something we saw many times in previous movies, we need something new, refreshing, not jokes like having a guy who looks like broccoli. Movie that introduced villain like Kang is, needs to be more serious, a bit darker, more mysterious. Spare us with stupid and meaningless dialogues, lame motivational lines that 6 year olds find non amusing. With few honorable exceptions, everything seems to be the same with Marvel lately. I will only hope this will change in a near future and that MCU will hit new highs."
5," Average Superhero Flick
",Saif_Hindawy,/user/ur45315009/,26 February 2023,"This movie is nothing special in terms of narrative. It's your classic good guy versus bad guy superhero trope. It is filled also with all kinds of Hollywood cliches such as the family drama about a secret past, the child who surpasses the parent's expectations, and so on. The idea of a Horton Hears a Who style of super tiny creatures living right underneath us in a micro world is cool but certainly not that unique. Furthermore, the civilizations displayed although interesting in terms of look and feel is one-dimensional and not dragged out like I would have wanted it to.The movie is funny sometimes but not frequently enough to be described as a fully entertaining watch. The action sequences are mostly hard to follow, there is simply too much happening on screen. The viewer is overwhelmed by laser guns and other similar over-the-top combat. If you despise movies that overuse hard sci-fi words without actually explaining the relevance of the science behind them, this is not the movie for you. Its quantum this and atomic that. I like the idea of multiple dimensions and that aspect of the movie is cool and I am waiting to see what happens in future MCU explorations of that idea. However, the multiverse aspect is done much more smoothly in the spiderman movies and animations. What carries this movie is the CGI, it is a visually striking piece. Particularly, in the beginning when they enter the quantum realm, it looks like an Alice in Wonderland kind of trip. Just go in with these things in mind and you might still get some enjoyment out of it."
7," Phase 5 begins!
",petrxpp,/user/ur38675714/,26 February 2023,"The third Ant-Man is a spectacular visual spectacle, where filming in virtual studios brings an interesting world flirting with Star Wars and Dune, it is a brisk and entertaining spectacle, at the same time emotions and the great Jonathan Majors work in it. Kang the Conqueror is a pretty tough bastard who definitely has not said his last word and thats a good thing. The acting ensemble is quite old, but I have to mention Michelle Pfeiffer. She is a really beautiful woman and has her own charm. All in all, it is a fast-paced story, in a beautiful world full of wit, action and fun. I would be lying if I did not say that I was hoping for more emotion and harshness, but I will take this.Phase 5 begins!"
10," Unnecessary criticism
",subhrasmishra,/user/ur162744521/,26 February 2023,"In a marvel movie what do I expect?A good story line
Good action scenes
Good suspense
Good comedy
No boring momentsFound all of it in this movie
Just coz you want to criticize a movie
Please see the effort that people have put in.It contains your usual marvel action and more, it contains the comedy I mean ""Its like hugging a dinosaur"". What don't you like about that?Emotions running high over the rebellion and ants. Of course I would have loved more of the ants.Come on people if you liked Loki and She hulk, this movie was far far better than any of those slow moving things.Not as psych as Moon knight but at par with some of the better marvel movies."
8," Absolutely massive!
",ubasarsahin,/user/ur78343404/,26 February 2023,"I don't see a reason for this movie to be hated, at all. It's got everything an Ant Man movie should have and even more. I see the director, Peyton Reed, being more confident than ever and he pulled this movie off so well.Paul Rudd is hilarious as usual and I was amazed to see Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang!I loved the visual effects and all the costumes designed for this movie. I think they were super creative. The ships, the living-beings, creatures and especially Kang!When I was watching quantumania scenes I thought to myself they were actually playing big with those battle scenes took place in that realm. It looked amazing. And I know it's very controversial but in my humble opinion this movie can compete with Avengers movies.Yes, frankly, I am blown away.-Watched in Imax 3D."
7," Not bad... Expected more!
",garethwooduk,/user/ur76271796/,26 February 2023,"I really enjoyed the first two movies, plot for the 3rd I really liked having visited the quantum realm besides Hope & Scott's Daughter Casey makes sense for it be be played out there.I loved the idea that the quantum realm has its eco system and it's own people and strange beings but it felt very Guardians of the galaxy but saying that set pieces were good and everyone putting in a good performance but Kang The Conqueror is meant to be the new big bad?Sadly not convinced, more of a pussy cat and very hard having seen how destructible Thanos was, was hoping for more!Other than that, enjoyed at most just not brilliant!"

4," More plot holes than an overused hillbilly underwear
",keremozkan-76561,/user/ur134260808/,26 February 2023,"I know some will suggest that
what I write is overly critical but even my 12 yr old daughter kept rolling her eyes at the stupidity of the story line and the lameness of the overall dialogue. The characters other than Ant-Man and the Wasp were sadly so over the top and impossible to believe. Once again watching this latest Hollywood so-called block buster you get a sense it was written for someone with an IQ of 13 and most importantly The Bad Guys just have about the worst aim ever... when it come time to shooting our heros from a distance of six feet. And also the ending why oh why must all Marvel directors feel the obligation to indicate blatantly that another (obviously unnecessary) sequel is on the way just to make a buck. As my grandpa used to say even though you put dog poop on good bread and serve it up with top condiments you are still gonna eat crap."
4," Is it bad
",pduffek,/user/ur154716171/,26 February 2023,"That movie lost what was great about the first two Ant-Man movies..........which is that it's a story about a guy trying to make amends. Here's another saving the world. It's so empty that I think: Isn't the time when Marvel TOP was gone? It's not just the problem of the last Ant-Man, but of the entire Multiverse saga. Doctor Strange 2 was rushed, Thor became a parody of himself, and the third Ant-Man became another world-saving figure of the dozen. Where is the difference? Hell, the first Ant-Mans were about family and self-righteousness and didn't need another intergalactic threat. And even Doctor Strange 2 and Thor 4 (although it didn't really suit me) had at least some author's imprint. Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania, on the other hand, is the essence of cinematic emptiness. The only really good projects from the Multiverse saga so far are Loki, WandaVision and Spider-Man: No Way home."
8," Critics are too harsh.
",bjohnston-85027,/user/ur162729453/,26 February 2023,"I enjoyed this film, not as much as Antman and the Wasp but about the same as the original Antman. The only thing I didn't really like about this was the humour, it wasn't the funniest and kind of tried too hard to be funny. I enjoyed the possibility loop with all the Scott's and them all interacting together (I'm a fan of time travel and Sci fi concepts so it was cool. ) Kang was great and I enjoyed the first end credits scene with all the Kang varients in the stadium and loved the second one showing Loki and Mobius encountering the very first Kang who invented Time Travel. Modok was good and I especially liked the fight scene at the end where Scott was massive.Overall it was a good movie and I'm looking forward to what phase 5 has to offer us in the future."
8," Much better than I anticipated
",StormyLines,/user/ur60627186/,26 February 2023,"Based on the mixed reviews we almost waited for it to come to Disney+. But I'm glad we saw it in theaters instead! It was much better than I thought it would be, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. With the past few marvel movies like Thor and Black Panther being just alright I was totally prepared for this movie to be the same way, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was exciting, funny, thrilling, interesting and not at all boring, and there being a quantum realm civilization down there with people living in it was somehow more believable than the underwater city in Black Panther Wakanda forever. I recommend giving it a shot but I don't think everyone will like it."
1," Bad casting decisions and complete silliness
",jelenamnr,/user/ur131777089/,26 February 2023,"The film's entire premise was sadly silly and devoid of any real scientific foundation. The decision to replace Abby Ryder Fortson (who is 14 years old) with Kathryn, who is 26 years old, was a terrible one because Kathryn's acting was pretty bad and Abby was the right age to continue playing the role. This is, by far, my least favorite of the three films. The film also lacked the previously mentioned actors Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian, and TI (they were hilarious in the previous films). I believe children will enjoy it, but it lacks the appeal of the other films. There are numerous ridiculous fist fights, nonstop action, and stunning CGI visuals. This film was less humorous than its predecessors."
5," Meh it was decent
",sewalker-12265,/user/ur98945856/,26 February 2023,"It was an ok film, not one you would watch again. My son really liked it. I didn't like that they didn't really recap the back story so if you hadn't seen the first two (we didn't) you didn't really understand how everyone knew each other. The storyline had lots of plot holes and I don't think any of the science really made sense behind it. I think the writers just assumed people would consume it because they used the buzzword multiverse. The film had some entertaining parts but was very predictable and you knew where it was going the whole time. The actor that played Kang did a really nice job and that part was intriguing. All in all it was ok. The character of Cassie was particularly annoying, probably could of done without her entirely."
10," Don't Trust Haters
",varnium,/user/ur29238510/,26 February 2023,"This movie is in fact the best Ant Man movie ever. Not many people understand the concept of space-time continuum or quantum physics. But Marvel surely integrated those concepts with this Ant Man movie.For those haters out there, you must understand first the basics of those 2 concepts. It has been theorized by Einstein that everything at subatomic level consist purely of probability. There's no certain way to determine whether an object is at one place or at multiple place at the same time. Also at subatomic level, time does not exist in a linear fashion as we human perceive it. Hence everything related to space and time at subatomic level can be purely fantasy or purely science fiction.That is exactly what Marvel did with Quantumania. They created a purely fantasy universe where everything can just be anything and at any place all at once. It's the reason why you can see people or objects can replicate themselves. It's the reason why you can see a ""Star Wars"" atmosphere in this movie. It's the reason why all of geek's imagination come to live in this universe. So it's actually a perfect realization of the ""quantum universe"" here.As for the story line, it make perfect sense. There's no exageration. Every character behave the way they should be and the story progress as how it should be. You don't have to care of what it shows in the comic books, because if it's entirely the same as the comic books, then it is useless to see the movie. So don't complain about the different expectation here.In short, this Ant Man movie is a grand spectacle for everyone, especially for ""Star Wars"" fans."
5," Cringey dialogue, subpar vfx
",mason_whitaker,/user/ur96422460/,26 February 2023,"This one makes me sad. I was really looking forward to this being the redemption for marvel for me. I'm going to keep this short and sweet. The dialogue in this film is ATROCIOUS. I get the whole arc with Scott and his daughter, but my god I physically cringed every time they were interacting in important scenes. Worries me that this same writer is to write the kang dynasty. Multiple scenes looked as if they were standing on a sound stage with a projected image behind them. The lighting was off as well and it completely took me out of the film, you could easily tell when the green screen was standing out. Unfortunate."
8," Star Wars in the Quantum Realm
",matthutsonmovie,/user/ur162050259/,26 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the highly anticipated third installment in the Ant-Man series from Marvel Studios. Directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, the film delivers on the humor, action, and visual spectacle that fans have come to expect from the franchise. However it seems like the writers and directors are just mix mashing movies together such as Star Wars, referring to Mos Eisley Cantina scene and all of the various aliens you might encounter and other science fiction flicks which is not necessarily a bad thing but it doesn't leave much room for originality.The plot of the film centers around the discovery of a new quantum realm, which leads to a host of new challenges and adventures for the characters. Lang must team up once again with Hope van Dyne/The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) to navigate this new realm and save the world from a new threat.One of the strengths of the film is its cast of characters. The chemistry between Rudd and Lilly is as strong as ever, and their banter provides many of the film's comedic highlights. Douglas also delivers a standout performance as the cantankerous Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer's reasons for hiding the truth from her family were not very well developed or reasoned, while Newton brings a fresh energy to the role of Cassie.The quantum realm sequences are visually stunning and provide a trippy and mind-bending experience for the audience. However the CGI seemed low quality in certain aspects where the suits of Ant-Man and the Wasp looks like they were not even really wearing them, you could totally tell that it was CGI. At certain points it look like the film was trying to be Avatar in terms of visuals yet did not stand up to the quality of it. A plus was the action scenes which were well choreographed and exciting, with the use of size-shifting abilities adding an extra layer of creativity to the fight scenes. The film is not without its flaws.The villain, played by Jonathan Majors, is a pretty badass guy and I felt like he was a good villain for this series yet he seemed quite similar to Thanos in terms of his goals. He has his reasons for doing what he wants to do and I feel like this character could be developed even further. As We Know Marvel is planning to expand on this character because The Kang Dynasty film should be coming to theaters in 2025.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a fun and entertaining addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It delivers on the humor and action that fans have come to love, while also exploring new territory in the quantum realm. While not without its flaws, the film is a worthy addition to the franchise and is sure to leave audiences eagerly anticipating the next adventure of Ant-Man and the Wasp."

If that doesn't say it all then what does. Unfortunately, the plot was not entertaining enough to keep its viewers engaged. Super disappointing as the other two ant man movies were good and I quite like Paul Rudd too! A cameo or two could've saved the movie, disappointing to why they didn't include cameosOverall, quality of marvel movies are going downhill but I really hope they do something about it to bring back the magic!!It is important to note tho that the graphics, visuals were great in the movie."
7," Descent, but not like Marvel used to be.
",TheBlandCritic,/user/ur148469193/,26 February 2023,"Here's a recipe on how to ruin a Marvel movie:
1. Allow Disney to buy out your company and then they call the shots and fill it and ruin it with garbage.2. Or, hire Jared Leto.In all honesty, the movie was pretty good. It's not as bad as the other reviews were making it out to be. Yes, it didn't have that original marvel charm and pizazz that we all miss and look for, but it wasn't awful.There were definitely some Star Wars/MIB/Tron feelings to the story, which was really disappointing, and there were some moments of acting that were also disappointing, but overall it was really good.It feels like Disney is ruining movies using the same method DC used when they first began releasing movies: focus more on making the character look cool and spending excess amounts of money on expensive CGI shots that add nothing to the story.Should you spend money on an overly priced movie ticket to see this film? I would say save your money. It was definitely good, but seeing it in theaters didn't really add anything."
7," Solid Launch for Phase Five
",ericknromero,/user/ur3219083/,26 February 2023,"I don't get it. ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" was good. It's even borderline VERY good to me. With all the negative reactions and reviews I've been hearing, I'm wondering if I saw the same movie as everyone else.We pick up with Scott Lang, who is a character exactly like the actor who plays him (Paul Rudd), enjoying life and a certain level of fame as an Avenger who saved the universe in ""Endgame."" His daughter Cassie, played convincingly by Kathryn Newton, is a chip off the old block, so to speak. She's been working on something special, with the help of ol' Hank Pym (Michael Douglass) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and soon the whole family is sucked down into the quantum realm by you-know-who.Michelle Pfeiffer surprised me when I knew I shouldn't be. Her performance as Janet Van Dyne is a reminder to all that she still has it. Janet and you-know-who had been marooned together for quite a long time, allies at first, but I'll let you watch the movie to get the rest of the story. The film does a wonderful job of slowly and simultaneously revealing the wonders of the quantum realm and Janet's role in the antagonist's re-emergence.Speaking of which, you-know-who is none other than Kang the Conqueror, the big bad of Marvel that will make Thanos seem like a warm-up. Jonathan Majors is the perfect actor to play Kang, and I mean perfect. He even has a similar face to many of the comic depictions of the villain. More importantly, Majors has the ability to play all the different variant personalities of Kang when it comes time... and considering the next Avengers movie has Kang in the title, I'm guessing we'll see several more of them.This adventure really is Star Wars-esque in its presentation and feel. Peyton Reed is on it, man, and he even found a way to include a nutty character like M. O. D. O. K. I saw this in 2D, but the directing of Reed may lead me to try and find a 3D version before it leaves the theaters.""Quantumania"" is better than any of the Phase 4 movies not named ""Spider-Man.,"" and I'd say in the top half of all MCU films. So yes, it was a success, not just in giving Phase 5 a proper launch but in being fun on its own."
3," I fell asleep
",jeffrousselvp,/user/ur0786271/,26 February 2023,"No really I fell asleep. Save your money. Boring dialogue. What is a plot? Now I'm just going to pad out the description with meaningless words. Maybe Disney will use it for a script for their next movie. It had a preview for the Flash movie. Oh, I got a lot of Star Wars style scenes in the movie. It also has Bill Murray in it. I had chicken wings and fried pickles with Mountain Dew. It wasn't that bad. I saw it in 3D so that was a thing. Do you remember The Chris Farley show skits from SNL in the 90's? That was cool. I have more fun watching Red Letter Media reviews on YouTube. Bye bye for now."
8," Top shelf performance by Jonathan Majors
",kariokiuhuru,/user/ur162731694/,26 February 2023,"My rating is based on the gravitas brought to an otherwise childish film by Jonathan Majors. His grounded performance gave the movie stakes and I literally sat forward when he was on screen. I can only imagine how difficult it must be to give a reserved performance when all around you is over-the-top comic relief. I will certainly be looking forward to more from Mr. Majors, including the upcoming Creed film.My own preference is to have movies in the real world rather than alternate dimensions or quantum realms but I'm giving 8/10 due to the oddly low scores I'm seeing from most everyone else. Surely was not among the worst Marvel offerings."
6," It's not how it looks in the trailer
",glori1491,/user/ur57477967/,25 February 2023,"It really wasn't what I expected, in the trailer the movie looked better quality in special effects and they put a lot of expectation on it. It does its job of entertaining, but since the whole movie is based on the quantum world (which is dark) it could get a little tiring. Cassie's performance is bad and I really expected better character development, as well as more wasp intervention. Kang is a good villain, and one is left wanting to know why he was banished. The worst character was MODOK, starting with the bad animation and his bad development as a villain. The special effects of the film really continue to be of the same poor quality as the latest Marvel movies and series, where it is noticeable that the characters acted on green screens, the best special effects scenes were in which the actors did not appear, I mean those that were not on green screen."

",dolphins-90130,/user/ur147334351/,25 February 2023,"Don't watch it, spend your time with something better! I used to be a big Marvel fan, but lately the movies are unfortunately really going down in quality. Dr. Strange was still okay, Thor was way to silly but this movie is just bad, bad, bad.... A bad story that largely doesn't make sense, bad acting and bad dialogue. It came across partly as a star wars rip off trying to just get in as many exotic a Ian's as possible. I normally like Paul Rudd but he couldn't bring it around. It was also not funny, a few tries at jokes fell flat. It was cringe worthy most of the time, utterly boring and - I have to say it again - just bad! Unfortunately these 2+ hours of our lifetime we won't get back..."

",abalpn-99472,/user/ur78394155/,25 February 2023,"It has been a decade since I've watched the first two films. The first two films are still my favorite films but this third film really amazed me. It is nothing like what we have seen in 2015 and 2018. The whole Marvel production worked really hard on making this film. When I saw the trailer, the setting sort of gave me a vibe from Guardians of the Galaxy or the Star Wars franchise. Paul and Evangeline still have great chemistry in the MCU. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer also have chemistry together. Kathryn Newton is fresh to the MCU and her character of Cassie Lang is awesome. I did see Kathryn in PokÃ©mon Detective Pikachu. Jonathan Majors is a really great actor and he is the perfect man to play Kang the Conqueror. Jonathan's character is more intimidating than Tom Hiddleston and Josh Brolin. Jonathan really stole the entire movie. I've waited to see Kang the Conqueror and all the Marvel fans cheered for his arrival. I'm looking forward to see Jonathan in the upcoming MCU films in the future. I really want to see Jonathan win an award whether it is from the Oscars, People's Choice Awards, Teen Choice Awards or Kids' Choice Awards. Kang is my most favorite Marvel villain.There are a lot of great special effects and the film's humor is good. My dad, brother and I laughed at humorous parts. The action is what we wanted to see and we were amazed at our seats. Of course there were intense moments that almost made my heart beat fast and I was at the edge of my seat thinking that something was about to happen. That is how Marvel does it when we watch every film. Overall, this film is great to see the action, special effects and intense or emotional moments."
5," Good performance with bad storyline

They totally ruined ant man like seriously guys he is an Avenger give some respect to him he is the one who woke the hopes of the Avengers. Even Jonathan's acting is superb but as a Marvel villain he is fail I just can't beleive guys, he is a Kang man 'Kang the conqueror' a movie has lots of potential but they totally waste it and also they forget to explain quantum realm or they just ignored intentionally I don't know but still this movie is enjoyable if you ignores the flaws.

10," Great fun, Big Adventure in a Strange World
",djmomo17,/user/ur12690203/,25 February 2023,"I absolutely had a blast with this film, and this is coming from someone who did not really care for the two previous Ant-Man films. Unlike those two, this is more of a sci-fi epic, in line with stories which take place ""a long time ago in a galaxy far far away"" :). I think superhero fatigue has set in for me, so when Quantumania decided to go all in on the sci-fi spectacle I was all aboard.Michelle Pfeiffer has always been a favorite of mine and she pretty much leads this film, Obi-Wan style. Paul Rudd is his usual likeable self, and even his daughter Cassie is likeable and unpretentious (unlike a few of the other adolescent heroines Marvel has been churning out).Although the VFX for one returning character are a bit underwhelming, I though the rest of it was fantastic. The developers literally created an entirely new universe, with innumerable alien races. Also, Christophe Beck's music was suitably rousing.For comic geeks:
As a long-time fan of the Fantastic Four in the comics, this film gave me hope that Marvel could actually do justice to an FF film adaptation. Quantumania had exactly the right elements which would fit in an FF film, and in fact reminded me alot of some of those '80s John Byrne issues where the team would go into the Negative Zone. In fact, the Quantum Realm is basically a stand-in for both the Microverse and the Negative Zone. Sharp eyes may note that Kang's robot soldiers are basically styled after Psychoman.Anyways, go in with an open mind and ignore the critics. This was a solid hit for me."
5," It was so hard to watch...
",ragibshahriar,/user/ur86471188/,25 February 2023,"Everything is generic in this movie. Being a Marvel fan, I was trying to connect to this movie so much. But the silly concepts, the Star Wars wanna-be plot, and the childish dialogues don't work at all.Yeah, Kang was good, but he was in a looney toons movie. It's like, everything goes; Kang's power level was never defined. And Cassie annoyed the hell out of me. There were so many 'dues ex machina' going around. Nothing had any consequence. I was just laughing out of cringe.This is not a movie. Marvel has become a content-churning machine. Truly, I feel shame for being a marvel fan. Multiverse of Madness is where I draw the line. Quantamania is just plain silly."
8," Wasn't that bad people.
",aristotelesathanas,/user/ur119558228/,25 February 2023,"It was different than the 2 previous that's true but people wanted more dark marvel projects so here it is. The performances of Michelle Pffiefer and Jonathan Majors were great and the action scenes were cool. The Cgi and dialogue were a little meh somwtimes.. In genaral, it had a good story but it needed to go deeper into the wasp's character, She had less scenes than the other movies. Cassie's character seemed good but with a better script she would be better. Whoever stayed for the credit scenes did good, cause they kinda add some points to the movie. People need to accept the difference between funny and dark and marvel needs to be careful for the Cgi stuff.!"
8," SPOILERS Mostly Good Film. Few Nitpicks
",phillhudson,/user/ur127953328/,25 February 2023,"First: things I want to add or change. This Kang is actually He Who Remains from Loki. He does escape, because why not? He kills all the other timelines and then ""retires"" after creating the TVA. He does not live in a linear line, so make him the guy from Loki Season 1. Bill Murray appears but the film forgets him. Like it forgot Scott's friends from the two previous films. Bill Murray could have appeared later in the film, like have him be MODOK's immediate supervisor. Scott's friends could have had scenes where they tweek with Cassie's device and that is how the team gets home. I also wish MODAK wasn't Darren. Just make him a Quantum native.Second: Editing issues, like we have Scott surrounded by the ""Kool Aid"" refugees, cut to bar with Bill Murray, cut back to next second with Scott, cut back to next second with bar, cut back to next second with Scott. The cuts should be when a time jump is needed or when the scene has set up or established what all it needs to establish. Just have scene with all the Scott drinks to understand the refugees and the leader says ""If you're here with Janet, HE will be looking for you."" Then cut to Bill Murray entering bar. He and Janet talk, he tells Hank and Hope Janet's life they before they have to fight and steal his ship (which he could have (to stay in the film) had helped them escape). MODOK could have used some more time. I probably would of had the actor just wear a MODOK body helmet and edited out the actor's body and enlarged him in the film to make him look more natural. MODOK is also another One-N-Done Villain. He could have been more!!! Also, Kang is killed AGAIN!!! I feel him we keep seeing Kang die over and over again in the MCU, how will the audience see him as an powerful villain since the heroes keep overpowering him. (Before comic Ultron is brought up, it's always the same Ultron, same mind that keeps coming back. This is a different Kang each time.) An inconsistantly: Scott and Cassie should have sufficated why big and removed their helmet. The oxygen molecules would be too small for them to breathe.Third: Good. It is a fun film. The actors are good. Idk why they recast Cassie. I like Janet having a big role. She's one of the best Avengers leaders in the comics. Kang looks like his comic counterpart, or as close as the MCU will probably get. Kang is also always serious. He doesn't joke, he is on task throughout the film. I also like that they had the suit be his source of power, so that when the ant overwhelmed him and damaged it, it made sense why he and Scott had a hand to hand conflict. Also did that by destroying Scott's helmet, he cannot change size if not fully suited. Scott's love for his daughter is still a major driving force. Cassie is trying to be a hero like Scott. Hank Pym is great. Still wish he was the main Ant-man in these films.I enjoyed the film mostly, just had a few nitpicks."
8," Just a fun Marvel movie
",ferreroeleonora,/user/ur155322570/,25 February 2023,"A good story that starts taking you into the adventure straight away.The plot is easy to follow, never boring and really just nice to watch. The cast is great to bring the characters to life.It reminds me of one of the good original marvel movies, where the story begins and ends with the movie, and you can just truly enjoy the experience of watching a superhero story for about 2 hours.Just a comment about negative reviews: after end game, it feels like everyone expectations are over the roof. Can't we simply enjoy a movie, without too many expectations of grandeur or build up of a saga?To be fair, the introduction of Khan is amazing, and the movie really gives a good background story about his character.Just go and watch Ant man and the was quantomania. It's really a good way to spend two hours!"
8," It's ok.
",ISAK2010,/user/ur156977904/,25 February 2023,This movie is 2nd lowest rated MCU movie on Rotten Tomatoes 48% while Eternals are 47% rotten on rotten tomatoes.1st Ant Man movie is the best from Ant Man franchise but I see the problem in this one. I think this movie tried to be the better than 1st and 2nd Ant Man movies but the prequels are still better but still the movie is awesome. Well I watched the movie in IMAX 3D so I think the movie is amazing in 3D.So nobody dies in the movie and Kang will return.In the post credit scene there's a short announcement for Loki Season 2 which is planned to release this summer.Darren from Ant Man (2015) is playing M. O. D. O. K. I think M. O. D. O. K. Is the funniest thing in the movie because when I heard the reactions of people in the theater I realized that M. O. D. O. K. Is the big suprise from Marvel.I highly recommend this movie to be seen in 3D in theaters. It's not the best but not the worse.
5," Poorly written, and a visual mess
",bxuser,/user/ur27853788/,25 February 2023,"As the MCU moves into it's latest phase, the core universe's story revolves around very complex topics like time manipulation and multiverse travel. Two topics that have me personally, SO excited for their potential. The complexity of these topics requires more exposition, and frankly less absurdity to tell a story that's relatable and inserstandable. Quantumania, as well as Dr. Strange 2 falls very flat there... the only exception to this trend being the Loki TV series. In this review I'll compare the tone, writing, and visual language between Loki and Quantumania to give better context why the latest Ant Man qualifies as ""truly forgettable"" and ""see only because you have to"" for dedicated MCU fans.Writing:
Quantumania celebrates the ignorance, pride, and I'll informed wokeness of Ant Man's daughter. The plot was driven by character choices that were instant gut decisions that lacked information, context, or any subtlety.The biggest reason I enjoyed Thanos related plots, was the ""Lawful evil"" nature of his ""well intentioned"" actions which is addressed, confronted, and contextualized by the 'heros'. This was expertly done with the introduction of ""he who remains"" in Loki as well. In those films there is gray space for the viewer to understand that the world is complex, and careful consideration of morals and actions are what make heros, not a 'underinformed gut reaction for whoever looks oppressed'. In Loki, the time spent on character development of Loki, Sylvie, and He Who Remains give their poor choices context, and made for much more engaging drama and emotional impact.Humor: a few funny moments, most were semi crude fart jokes. Small things like fat Thor and a sassy dr. Strange cloak are enough. Weird giant face robots and endless talk of holes is just... Cheap and dumb.Ending scene: terrible and kind of confusing. Was it a Meta-retrospection on how bad the writing of the film was?Visual language:
In one word... Maximalism. This film was so visually distracting that I often was pulled away from the plot. So much CGI that it left me yearning for just a scene with two people talking in a room making sense of wtf was going on. I don't know why they tried to make an Ant Man ""Avatar"", but the mess of crap on the screen felt nonconsensual to my eyes. This film proved that more isnt better, and boy I wish I never found out.It also struck me that in several scenes you could see that the actors reactions looked like they were just standing in a green screen studio. It's got be be hard to react correctly to a scene where your prompt is: ""you're flying on the back of a manta ray while lasers are shooting at you flying over a lake in a forest with fungus trees with a burned out looking sky and a giant head is trying to kill you"". Like wtf. In Loki, the viewers were introduced to one or two new elements/paradigms at a time. In Quantumania, everything in every scene was new. Maybe they did this on purpose to distract from the awful plot.See it if you must, but otherwise it's an easy skip. Jonathan Majors was incredible as always. He was the only redeemable piece of this mess. This film needed more explanation of literally everything, more subtlety, and SO MUCH less CGI."
2," Another weak entry
",vickyl-69725,/user/ur162701623/,25 February 2023,"I honestly don't really think that Ant - Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is worth seeing. I genuinely/usually like movies like this a lot but the plot went way to far in the silly direction for my liking and there was way too many times where it was hard to tell what was going on, who just lost, who was winning and the overall meaning of the story. There was also too much CGI, which isn't always a problem and can be nice if it's done well. However, it was done pretty badly in my opinion which might have been more manageable if it only happened every once in a while but it's actually in most of the movie so it's very hard to look past. It's another weak entry into the MCU and I hope they can fix things soon."
2," Low Expectations, Still Disappointing
",mbogich,/user/ur24920063/,25 February 2023,"You're probably wondering (well, probably not, but maybe you are) if I had such low expectations for Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, why did I go see it? The answer is simple, my brother and I were really, really bored, and he refused to see Puss in Boots 2. So, it's his fault really.My review will be brief because there's not much to say about the new Ant-Man. Simply put, it's the Disney-est Marvel installment yet, filled to the brim with smirky faces and cutesy one-liners. Also it felt like Ant-Man was put into a hybrid Star Wars and Avatar setting. Lost of fluffy marketable creatures and trippy landscapes. I miss the days when comic book flicks had a just little edge to them.I gave the movies two stars instead of just one because of Bill Murray and Jonathan Majors. The movie is unthinkably boring before these two characters appear. Murray, in his few brief scenes, actually made me chuckle. And to the movie's credit, the ratio of decent one-liners to complete duds is better than most recent Marvel movies-something in the area 1 to 27. Majors, as the villain Kang, supplied the only non-tongue-in-cheek performance, and was pretty good, given what he had to work with.Aside from the kiddie tone of this and other recent Marvel releases, there is one other issue I want to touch on: the scope of the threat facing the heroes. In most recent Marvel (and other bad, high-budget action movies), the whole world or universe or multiverse is at stake, and it just kills the tension. As an audience member, you know the good guys will prevail. Still, when it's a case of either the good guys win or all life will end, the happy ending is just a little too obvious.I regret seeing this movie both because it was a waste of time, and also because I don't like supporting Disney and their increasingly mediocre offerings. So here and now, I swear to only pirate Disney and Marvel movies until they once again make something worth paying for.Summary: do not see this movie if you are not in the single digit age or triple digit IQ range.Side Note: there were 10 trailers in the (AMC) theater where I saw this. Movie trailers used to be one of the most exciting parts about going to the movies, but now, both because of YouTube and because they show you at least 8 every time, I'm just about over it."
4," What the f did I just see :-o
",klusik,/user/ur11996505/,25 February 2023,"Although it is a Marvel movie, the experience left much to be desired. The majority of the movie felt like a procession of computer-generated characters on computer-generated backgrounds, acting out a very predictable story.However, there were a few things that stood out - the main antagonist, played by a talented actor, was a truly remarkable character with believable motivations. Additionally, the performance of the actress portraying the Pym wife was noteworthy.Despite these two bright spots, the movie's story was very typical of Marvel, with around 95 % of the plot following familiar cliches, making it quite dull and uninteresting. The dialogue was equally unimpressive, as it sounded like it was written by teenagers under the influence. The main female character seemed to only say ""DAAAD!"" or ""MOOOOM!"" for 95% of the film, making it cringe-worthy.This was the first Marvel movie in over a decade that I was tempted to leave before the end credits rolled (though I ultimately stayed). After this experience, I cannot justify spending any more money on Marvel movies. The film was ugly, terrible, awkward, and unintelligent, save for the main antagonist and sound, which were decent.4/10, definetely not recommending this one."
5," ""It doesn't make sense"" - Scott Lang
",paullevantis,/user/ur81482987/,25 February 2023,"You're damn right Scott!Can someone please explain to me where Kang comes from, why he has all these powers, why he calls himself Kang, why he was banished, how he has an army, why he has followers, why he creates poverty, how he creates poverty, how he destroys worlds, and what he ultimately wants other than revenge for his variants who banished him? At least the actor (Jonathan Majors) was very good, as we know from season 1 of Loki, which is superior to this.You know who's acting sucked though? Whoever played Cassie Lang. How useless can you get?? Also, how does she manage to get imprisoned so much, how did she make that ridiculous machine with minimal help, how old is she (because by my maths she's about 14), and why does she refer to Hank as her grandfather? She made the movie a LOT worse, and so did Hope, who, unlike in the two previous films, was just one dimensional, lame, pointless, boring, and annoying.Positives:
Paul Rudd. He once again delivered an entertaining performance, and paired with some of the best dialogue in the film, his character was very good. If it wasn't, the movie would probably be terrible.Hank Pym: good performance and reliable character.The mind reader dude: entertaining character performed excellently.The ant army UNTIL they decided to let Kang go and disappear for the rest of the movie.Overall, a fair few entertaining moments/characters and points of potential, but riddled with a story that hardly made any sense and a couple of terrible characters."
7," A promising start of Marvel Phase 5, with a few exceptions.
",groundzero-273-397110,/user/ur30812911/,25 February 2023,"A promising start of Marvel Phase 5, with a few exceptions. The things that I liked in this movie outweighs the things I disliked. The story about Kang and Kang as a character was interesting, even though we did not get that much information about him and his past, yet. I just really hope that the version of Kang that was in this movie did not die. The other Kangs that was introduced in the end did not seem interesting at all. Kang did not really feel that powerful either, at least not as powerful as I thought he would be when he is bragging about how many Avengers he has killed etc. He then get beaten by some ants? What?! It would also had been better if Kang actually killed Ant-Man, or at least some of his family... But I suspect that this version of Kang will be back, more powerful and angrier.The comedy was good, even though they try to much sometimes, but a few things made me laugh very much for a long time. Like the broccoli man and how Michael Douglas acted and talked about it was hilarious. MODOK, or Darren, was also very funny to watch most of the time. I have always liked Ant-Man and Paul Rudd in that role, and he was excellent as usual. They could have cut down on Cassie, like a lot, and given some more time for the Wasp to shine. Cassie was really annoying most of the time, and how did she manage to build that stuff and become an expert in 5 years while still pretty young?The dialogue was kinda bad now and then. Like when Cassie had her speech to the people which was kinda cringe, or when telling Darren not to be, you know, a dic..Overall, I was entertained and liked this movie much more than most of the garbage in Phase 4! I'll give it 7/10!"
2," We survived to the end of the movie
",kel-02810,/user/ur135544902/,25 February 2023,"Other than the wow factor of seeing Michael Douglas, Michael Pfiefer, and Bill Murray the film was not enjoyable. Focus is on what they can do with effects. The effects were good which is why I gave it an extra star. The storyline was strained and convoluted we just kept hoping for an ending. Afterwards I wanted a tshirt that said we survived Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania 2023. It was constant treachery with what seemed to me too little relief to develop the human side of the characters. Maybe it is just not my style but I feel like I don't have anything in common with the makers of this movie. Maybe our family was not the target audience but they got our money so I offer this review in return."
3," A regression for Marvel
",mquo77,/user/ur84495571/,25 February 2023,"This movie starts off ok, with a similar feel to the first two Ant-Man movies. Paul Rudd is still great as the main character. Unfortunately, as soon as it goes to ""the quantum realm"" (about 20 minutes in) it stays there for the rest of the movie.I didn't particularly like the quantum realm stuff in pre-endgame movies, I thought it was too silly: populated with giant versions of single-cell organisms. But now it's waaaaaaay sillier, like a bunch of primary school kids got to design a character each. The realm is now populated with all kinds of creatures, even human, although they all look completely different. There is no explanation of what they are, where they come from, it's just a bunch of made-up nonsense. I love sci-fi and fantasy, but the makers of this film have somehow managed to take a blank canvas of a concept and just doodle all over it without absolutely nothing of interest to look at or think about. And the plot cannot save it. If you are following the MCU, you can skip this whole movie and it won't make any difference to anything.I absolutely loved most of the MCU up until endgame, enjoyed most superhero movies most of my life, but the last couple of MCU I've seen at the cinema (this and Wakanda Forever) I actually thought about leaving the theatre after the first 45 minutes. I didn't, because I believe in giving a movie a chance in the first viewing at least. However, to assume people would want to watch this nonsense for 3 hours is very optimistic."
5," Majors carrying the movie almost by himself
",archanademonia,/user/ur68437633/,25 February 2023,"Okay, so what did the writers take before writing this script? This is poor coming from Marvel, and someone is trying to be funny like Taika Waititi but failing hard. Instead of laughing of scenes that I am sure were supposed to be funny, there were a lot of headshaking because things were just BIZARRE.Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly totally lost their chemistry in this movie, the acting from almost everyone was stiff. The whole ""we are a loving family"" vibe this movie is trying to portray feels forced and I did not believe it for a second. The actors who are carrying this movie for everyone are Majors and Pfeiffer, but especially Majors. I didn't understand his character in Loki series and thought he just acted poorly but this man is actually pretty amazing, and now I understand his character in Loki so much more based on the way he acted in Ant-Man. I am looking forward to seeing him again in the next installment he's in.The plot is fine, not really surprising but fine, but the movie is slow in build up with absolutely no memorable scenes. The quantum realm looks stunning with what seems like a lot of inspiration from Star Wars, but that alone doesn't help an otherwise flat and close to boring movie.I've watched the previous Ant-Man movies several times but this does not feel like it's worth a re-watch at all, which is a shame."
7," Great fun
",scottleerobinson,/user/ur98548094/,25 February 2023,"I'm not sure if all the negative reviews I've heard about are just to try and trash the films or if I just went in with low expectations because if them but I really enjoyed this,I found it really funny and beautifully weird.its in no way one of the best marvel films but it's definitely above average and it was nice to have a decent marvel film again after the disappointing wakanda forever.the cast are great,Paul Rudd is perfect as Antman and is always fun to watch,Modok was a brilliant addition and executed perfectly.this was a nice start to phase 5 and I'm looking forward to guardians of the galaxy 3 next,ignore the reviews,even mine,just give it a watch and make your own mind up."
6," Marveltards when the CGI good guy beats the CGI bad guy for the 96th movie in a row...
",villarosie,/user/ur135243249/,25 February 2023,"""Ant Man: Quantamania"" was a disappointing follow-up to the previous Ant Man films. The plot was predictable and repetitive, offering nothing new to the franchise. The same tired formula of Scott Lang fighting against a villain who wants to use the power of the Pym particles for their own gain was used again, with little added to the storyline.The humor and jokes fell flat, lacking the charm and wit that made the previous Ant Man films so enjoyable. The comedic tone felt forced and uninspired, making it difficult to become invested in the characters or the plot.Even the action sequences, which are usually a highlight of the Ant Man movies, felt repetitive and unengaging. The use of size-changing technology can be visually impressive, but in ""Quantamania,"" it felt like the same gimmick was used over and over again, leading to a lack of excitement and tension.Overall, ""Ant Man: Quantamania"" was a mid, boring, and repetitive film that failed to live up to the standard set by the previous Ant Man movies. While there were some entertaining moments, the predictability of the plot, lackluster humor, and repetitive action sequences left much to be desired. If you're a fan of the franchise, it might be worth a watch, but don't expect anything groundbreaking or particularly memorable."
6," Another MCU movie that only earns money but fails to deliver story
",jaysonpajaronvistal,/user/ur158145467/,25 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the introduction to phase five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in which we are introduced to another realm and a new villain. If you have watched the trailer of Ant-Man, it's basically the first 30 minutes of the movie, and should you expect more from that? No! The movie focused more on proving why Ant-Man deserved to be in the Avengers despite making his character comical and a caricature during the Avengers era. Due to this, Jonathan Major's character, Kang, felt like a weaker version of Thanos even though the movie heavily implied that he was powerful and dangerous because of what he wanted to do.The movie has a very rough and uneven pace. The first act felt bumpy and jagged, but the second act was able to redeem it. One good act can't redeem a film overstuffed with so much story, and many characters, that you'll hope everyone would stall their hackneyed jokes. Since this is an introduction to another adventure for the MCU, we are introduced to so many characters, that resulted in them being underwritten, and some characters from the franchise are underutilized. Evangeline Lilly's character, Hope, was overshadowed by Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and I am more invested in Janet's story than Hope's. Bill Murray as Lord Krylar also has a cameo but they wrote his character to be somewhat interesting but was left off, or maybe since this is just an introduction to his character---I don't really know. Corey Stoll as M. O. D. O. K was a fun and weird-looking character as well, but it felt like a one-off that can only be used once. However, I appreciate that they used the same character to play M. O. D. O. K. As it added relevance to the story.In all honesty, it was Paul Rudd's charm and humor that carried the comedy in this film, and this time, his character has more sense and does not feel like a caricature version of Paul Rudd. Unfortunately, lackluster writing and repetitive Marvel clichÃ©s did not allow for Rudd's effortless charm to carry the movie. My biggest problem with the film is how they did not fully utilize Kang's story, it was heavily implied in the movie that he was stronger and bigger than most villains in the MCU and it was shown in the movie the danger of what he wanted to do but failed to demonstrate it. By placing an opponent that is nearly godly level, it should feel threatening and terrifying to the point that Ant-Man can't even fight him toe-to-toe, however, the villain looked like on the same level as Thanos' Corvus Glaive.Is Ant-Man 3 worth watching to keep up with Marvel's new phase? Yes! But the movie settled on being ""just okay"" and is primarily stuck on needing to be bigger instead of being amusing, compelling, and unique. Nonetheless, as an introduction to Phase 5, there is much more to wait for and a story to tell, and the Quantumania is a good realm to start."
9," MCU trying to get back on track
",michaelgrc8,/user/ur35200093/,25 February 2023,"Been critical of the last phase of the marvel universe besides a few exceptions like Shang Chi and Spider Man. Now that we're past that I think the reviews for this film were far too critical and expected the same agenda driven go nowhere movie. That been said this movie couldn't get a 10 just due to the first 20 minutes and Cassies character that was too predictable and seemed to smirk thru out half the movie.Once we got past that the movie hit it in to high gear and it never stopped, everyone was right about Kang he stole the show and is going to hopefully bring us back for more great movies to come.Finally getting back to being excited about the next few films and hope they stick to the storytelling and not agendas."
6," Not as bad as I expected but just OK
",D4V1D2411,/user/ur106641918/,25 February 2023,"I went to see this movie expecting to see one of the worst MCU movies because of the critic reviews and other comments but after watching it I can confirm that most of them are over exagerated. Its still one of the weakest movies of the MCU but after, Love and Thunder, Ms Marvel and She Hulk, its not as bad as those, there ae quite a few things to like. Mainly, the villain, Kang. He absolutely steals the show and every scene he is in, you can feel he is an Avengers level threat and the actor gives his all to make it even better. Scott and some action scenes are also on te good side of the movie, they managed to be entertaining at all time and while these are just few moments, they are enough to save this film a little bit. Buuuuuut, there is also a lot of bad stuff. The quantum world is just boring. Thats just how it is. There is nothing interesting about it, we never know anything about the people living there, we never feel anything for this world, honestly, if it was destroyed or something, I wouldnt even miss it. The side characters are horrible, they do nothing, the Wasp is done so dirty in the movie, that there are times when you forget she even exists, its just at the end when she does something and its not that much. Hank and Janet are also there just to explain scientific things and look smart but besides that, they could very well be dead. And I hated the quantum people, their designs are mostly bad and their jokes are very cringy. The more I think about them, the more I want the quantum realm to be destroyed. Cassie is just there, acting bad, existing and doing absolutely nothing else. The story is just meh, Ant man stealing some stuff for Kang and the side characters trying to find him. Its just ok, but I would have prefered a story more like the first 2 movies, those felt more like ant man movies and had their own style and comedy, things which are mostly ruined in this one. I hope Marvel recovers and goes back into the light path because if they dont and they continue like this, theyre gonna have bad times ahead."

6," Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania
",jboothmillard,/user/ur4248714/,25 February 2023,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has already gone through thirty-one movies and four Phases, this film marked the beginning of Phase Five, it was rated well by critics, so I was up for it, directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On, Down with Love, Yes Man). Basically, Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) has written his autobiography, Look Out for the Little Guy, which becomes successful, and he has settled with his girlfriend, Hope van Dyne aka The Wasp (Lost's Evangeline Lilly). Scott's teenage daughter Cassie (Freaky's Kathryn Newton) has become a political activist, and is constantly being bailed out of hail; she has become estranged from her father since he is focusing on his celebrity status rather than saving people as Ant-Man. While visiting Hope's parents, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), Cassie reveals that she has been working on a device that can establish contact with the Quantum Realm. She turns it on, but Janet panics and forces it to be shut off. But the message has already been received, and suddenly the portal opens and pulls the five of them into the Quantum Realm. Scott and Cassie are found by natives who are rebelling against their ruler, while Hope, Janet, and Hank explore a large city to find help. Hope, Janet, and Hank meet with Lord Krylar (Bill Murray), formerly an ally of Janet's, he reveals that things have changed since she left. Kang (Jonathan Majors), an exiled traveller Janet previously knew, now known as Kang the Conqueror, has become the ruler of the Quantum Realm, Krylar is working for him now. Hope, Janet, and Hank are forced to flee and steal Krylar's ship. Meanwhile, Scott and Cassie are told by rebel leader Jentorra (Katy M. O'Brian) that Janet's involvement with Kang is indirectly responsible for his rise to power. Soon, Kang's forces attack them, led by M. O. D. O. K. (Mental Organism Designed Only for Killing), who is revealed to be Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who survived his apparent death when he was previously Yellowjacket. Aboard Krylar's ship, Janet confesses to Hope and Hank what really happened to her during her time in the Quantum Realm and why she never to return. She found Kang who she assumed was trapped alongside her, he claimed he could help them both escape from the Quantum Realm if she helped him rebuild his power core capable of travelling through the multiverse. After they managed to repair it, Janet touched his chip and had a vision of Kang's true thoughts, planning to conquer and destroy entire timelines. Kang revealed he was exiled by his own variants (versions of himself) who feared him, and Janet turned on him. Janet used her Pym Particles to enlarge the power core and render it unusable. Kang eventually regained his powers and conquered the Quantum Realm some time after; Janet had been fighting him ever since until her rescue. Scott and Cassie are taken to Kang, who threatens to kill Cassie if Scott does not help get his power core back. Scott is taken to the core's location and shrinks down. Scott finds himself surrounded by variants of himself and is almost drowned, bur Hope arrives and helps him acquire the power core. However, Kang goes back on the deal, capturing Janet and destroying her ship. Hank returns, having been rescued by his ants, they were also pulled into the Quantum Realm, they grew in size and rapidly evolved into hyper-intelligent beings; Hank helps Scott and Hope as they make their way to go against Kang. Cassie rescues Jentorra and they commence an uprising against Kang and his army. During the fight, Cassie appeals to Cross's human side that he can change his ways for the better good. Cross is convinced to turn sides and fight Kang, though he sacrifices himself in the process, and dies from his injuries. Janet repairs the power core allowing the group to return home. But while she, Hank, Hope, and Cassie jump through the portal, Kang attacks Scott, nearly beating him into submission. Hope returns to save Scott, together they destroy the power core with a combination of Pym Particles, Kang is knocked into, causing him to be pulled into oblivion. Cassie reopens the portal to return home with Scott. Having returned, Scott resumes his life, he momentarily questions something Kang said about something terrible that will happen, but he brushes it off. In a mid-credits scene, numerous variants of Kang are concerned by the increasing interest in the multiverse on Earth-616 and plan their uprising. In a post-credits scene, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Mobius M. Mobius (Owen Wilson) locate another Kang variant, named Victor Timely, on Earth in the 1900s. Also starring David Dastmalchian as Veb, William Jackson Harper as Quaz, and Randall Park as Jimmy Woo. Rudd returns as the insect-sized hero with some wisecracks, Lilly is fine as his love interest fellow costumed heroine, Pfeiffer and Douglas have their moments, and Majors is well cast as the villain intent of taking over. The story just about holds up as the characters enter the subatomic universe below our own, the special effects to create the alien creatures and landscapes are brilliant, the fight and chase sequences are suitably exciting, and there are some amusing moments. The multiverse concept means infinite possibilities for where it will go next, this sequel is certainly entertaining, admittedly there is a bit to get your head around sometimes, but overall this is a worthwhile superhero fantasy action. Good!"
5," Lacks emotion
",Gagarr,/user/ur2988429/,25 February 2023,"None of the characters really seemed to care about their strange situation. Their attempts at emotion wasn't believable in word or action. I get more emotion in 1 minute of a Taylor Sheridan show than this whole movie. The comedy also fell flat most of the time, with only a few chuckles. I love all the actors, Rudd, Douglas, Pfeiffer, Lilly, but they all seem to be phoning in their characters. The villains were disappointing, lots of talk about how bad they were, but they failed to prove it in any real action. So overall this failure is on the writer, who didn't provide words for the actors and the director who did a great job on the first 2 Ant-man films, but was too lazy to get any emotion out of his actors.I still gave it 5 starts, because the production value was still top notch."

",BigChis,/user/ur162690999/,25 February 2023,"Quantumania is everything it doesn't want to be and nothing it wants to be. The most fun I had watching this movie was joking with my friends about how bad some of the moments are. If you are trying to set up the next big bad Marvel, don't do a big introduction in an ANTMAN MOVIE.This movie succeeds in not taking itself seriously in moments it wants to be taken seriously. You want me to care about Kang then do not make him lose to a bunch of ants. Instead to make this movie better, either give us a light-hearted funny movie like the first Antman or step your big budget toes into at least just a puddle of something interesting and serious, so I will want to spend my money watching this.Marvel is in the rut right now and everyone and there mother knows it. But why but why you ask are they producing the same crap, it's because we still watch it. I spent my money watching it and you might have too, so next time I won't be so hopeful and instead I will go see a movie that does something unique with cinema. Low budget movies need to be saved from Marvel's boots and their throat."

",adrianlarsen,/user/ur111647951/,24 February 2023,"Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania is the supposed third movie in the Ant-Man trilogy. I say supposed because, as many others have said, it's like we skipped a film.In this one, Scott, Hope, Janet and Hank Pym travel to the Quantum Realm. A micro-realm world filled with sentient broccoli, sentient slime and Bill Murray.The movie looks nice, I'll give it that. If you can look past the obvious green screen and chroma-keying, it looks nice most of the time.Kang is nothing in this. He's evil to be evil and I have no idea why he's conquering.

K and the dude with the yellow blasters thingy for a head and Kang omg he is a amazing villian and I can't wait to see him in the future of the mcu. I liked the how ant man and the end of the movie was thinking like is the dude I just fought is he really dead but he carries on with it like nothing happen. It sucked that M. O. D. O. K died but he had a cool arc and it was cool to see Darren again and how he turned and how Kang saved him. The only thing I didn't like was how Bill Murray character was served though."
3," Other than Kang.. this movie subpar at best
",drummaverick,/user/ur153986807/,24 February 2023,"After a very disappointing phase 4 it looks like phase 5 is kicking off with a very poorly written, plot hole ridden mess of an Ant-Man movie. The laundry list of problems this movie presents is too long for this review but I will try to name a few. Scott Lang is a bumbling idiot who is superseded by his snarky, social justice, entitled daughter who is perfect in every way. The punchlines feel like they were written by 5 year olds, and Modok is the movies punching bag- jester that is never taken seriously and the CGI is awful. Kang is the only saving grace for this film and Marvel manages to mess that up as well. Unfortunately they de-power Kang towards the end completely taking away the threat level that he present earlier in the film. There are zero consequences in this movie and it wraps up like a perfect little Disney cartoon. Looks like End Game really was the end game."

6," It's a Cheese Pizza With Way Too Much Cheese.
",thatsgottahurt-1,/user/ur9049833/,24 February 2023,"Take Marvels recent lacklustre offerings, add some Avatar visuals and the dialogue and acting of the last few Star Wars films, and you have this. It's cheesy, in the extreme. It's chock full of the usual tropes and character motivators that plague Marvel films. It feels like we are being force fed the same story, over and over, in all their films. Most of the characters are unlikeable, shallow and forgettable. I stopped caring about any of them about 20, yawn inducing, minutes in. This is not good film making. Loud colours, over the top character dynamics and a weak plot, do not give you a good film. I felt like I was watching garishly dressed, looking for laughs and attention, annoyances. Clowns, in other words. I felt like I was watching clowns. And that makes me so sad."
5," It was like a slap to the face...
",paul_haakonsen,/user/ur22654354/,24 February 2023,"I initially didn't really want to waste a cinema admission ticket on watching ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"", but since my family were venturing out to watch it, I tagged along.And I have to say that the storyline in ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"", as written by writers
Jeff Loveness and Jack Kirby, was just rubbish. It was such a far out there storyline that it was near impossible to take serious. Luckily the movie was kept afloat by the over-the-top and impressive CGI special effects.The acting performances in ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" were good, and they definitely had a good and solid cast ensemble for the movie, with the likes of Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jonathan Majors, Kathryn Newton, Kathryn Newton, Bill Murray and Corey Stoll.The special effects, wardrobe and props are off the charts in ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"", but then again, that is the case with all Marvel movies, now isn't it? And it was, at least for me, this that made the movie bearable to sit through.I found ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" to be a waste of 124 minutes, and it was a rather weak addition to the Marvel line of superhero movies, almost as weak as the ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" movie. I know that I am not returning to watch director Peyton Reed's 2023 movie ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" a second time, because the storyline just didn't latch onto me.My rating of ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" lands on a bland five out of ten stars."
7," It slowly gets better
",jaysonjats,/user/ur123035382/,24 February 2023,"This is a great introduction to what Kang could really do for the future of the MCU. The movie starts off a bit slow with some jokes that feel forced. However, the storyline really starts to pick up in the second half.For the most part, the acting was really good with great performances with from the main cast of the movie. However there are cameos in this movie that seem like a money grab.The visuals and effects portrayed in the movie stand out more than most marvel movies in the past. There were scenes that would leave you ""wow"" but also ones that are uneccesary.Overall the plot of the movie was just alright. This isn't something memorable but if you're a marvel fan would leave you excited for the future of the MCU."
9," Good to Great movie
",iwasafool,/user/ur162685196/,24 February 2023,"I don't understand why people are under rating this film. Great intro, good plot, great fight, descent ending.It's a marvel movie, pure and simple, don't expect some Oscar ridden movie because it won't be and was never intended to be one. Endgame was deserving though . So don't over think it.We have an unrealistic view of how all Marvel movies should be. Keep it simple. If you expect all their films to be the same level of quality is unrealistic because we will keep expecting the next one to be better. Did you ever see Forest Gump 2 or The Shawshank Redemption 2 , how are you going to make it any better, same theory with Marvel movies. Deal with it."
3," Ant-Man has 7 holes, this movie was pushed out by one of them.
",callumdignan,/user/ur147469976/,24 February 2023,"My review of this movie I'll get to in a moment but first I feel like i have to clarify something. Bit of a lengthy review this one so strap in.Since Endgame there have been 18 movies and TV shows (almost as many as there were movies between Iron Man 2008 and Endgame 2019). I've watched everything MCU related and the only MCU content I can reference that was either good or just half decent is Spider-Man: No Way Home, Shang-Chi and Moon Knight. Each of these still obviously have their own problems but these problems personally aren't big enough that it weighs down the rest of the story for me. Everything else has been soiled by completely incompetent writing and just feels like corporate, lifeless, monotonous sludge pushed out by the colossal rectum that is Walt Disney Studio's to keep content and money flowing.I have been a solid fan of Marvel Studios for over a decade now and after Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness I had mentally checked out entirely. The writing for these movies/tv shows has become so ridiculously lazy and convoluted that its impossible to follow logically. They are treating the concept of the multiverse like its this sacred thing that can't be altered and they can't interact or merge but also that you can do anything what so ever with zero consequences because there's an infinite amount of other universes so who cares. Why should we as an audience care about your universe when you very blatantly don't care about it yourself.The multiverse can be an incredible story telling device if utilised properly and with meaning behind it, but they've instead decided to go down the Rick and Morty route and make it so nothing matters. Its entertaining for a moment but also loses all meaning when the stakes you set can be nullified completely at any moment. (Dosent surprise me that my friend mentioned after watching the movie that it felt like an episode of Rick and Morty, especially with some of the comedy, themes and the fact that marvel has now hired a multitude of writers from that show to head multiple different projects, including this one.)There is so much to say about how little there is to say about everything Marvel has released the past 4 years. The formula has been abused so hard that I can do a description of virtually everything they've put out the past few years in one go:Hero and friends are all in a great position, Hero accidentally discovers something, world/universe is in danger, comedy, action, comedy, action, one or two big subverted twists that makes no sense, means nothing and pleases nobody, comedy, action, big CGI fight and then the Hero and their friends are right back where they started. Throw in a few 'woke' wins/ideologies/issues to please the woke crowd and keep them defending any criticism of your films, kick your feet up and call it a day.(For context, the comment on the inclusion of 'woke' ideologies in these films isn't a comment on whether its good or bad, whether you should agree or disagree or whether it should or shouldn't even be in the movie, everybody has their own opinions and everybody is entitled to them. This is a comment on the fact that Disney very clearly dosent actually care about these issues they portray and instead uses these as some what of a shield against valid criticism of their films online.)Of course each new movie/show they put out they have to dangle a carrot in front of you in the form of some major marvel character/actor who is going to show up, and then of course by the end of the movie/show, that character/actor will have been retconned, killed off or just straight up revealed to not be the character you thought it was because ""hey we gotcha again didn't we lol look how clever and funny we are"". They want to use all of these crazy characters and properties they now own to entice people to come see their films but either don't have the balls to commit to any of them or dont have the talent/creativity to bring them to life, so they ""subvert"" our expectations, do something nobody wants and then call it clever. It's borderline false advertising at this point. Its like variations of groundhog day, especially now that I've just watched Bill Murray walk in and out of this movie so quickly I forgot he was even in the film until writing this review.Even without all the multiverse stuff almost every movie/TV show has been made to look so important and game changing yet felt so inconsistent and inconsequential that by the end you could completely remove it and it would make virtually no difference to the overall story. I'm not saying every movie has to have some next level, world changing thing that completely switches everything up but to have everything that has been released feel this lifeless really is a killer expecially when the MCU felt truly incredible at one point. Now its this dead husk being puppeted and milked for every penny by Disney.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is no exception. The concept for what this movie was about is actually great material however it is constantly bogged down by plot holes, terrible comedy and some questionable CGI. Don't get me wrong there were a few genuinely funny moments and for the most part the visuals are fantastic and the artists who brought this world to life should be proud of themselves. Infact everybody involved in the making of this movie should be proud because you can tell pretty much everybody brought it. However this movies suffers enormously from what everything else in Phase 4 of the MCU has suffered from.Horrendously incompetent writing.The overall story and concepts for these movies aren't the problem, its the lack of respect for the characters and source material and the attention to detail that these hack writers seem to not even remotely care about. Its gotten so bad that to even enjoy some of these movies you need to switch the thinking part of your brain off completely. I feel genuinely sorry for some of the highly talented actors in this film that had to regurgitate some of the most incomprehensibly insane dialogue I've ever heard in a movie.""But hey these are just stupid superhero movies for kids you're not supposed to think too deep into it""Some of the greatest movies I've seen are very much family friendly. Implying that because children's brains aren't as fully developed as adults its ok to phone it in and make everything braindead is whats killing cinema and empowering these lazy writers to not care what they put to paper. What made these movies and this universe so herculean now is the attention to detail and the respect they had for the characters, the story and the fans who got them to this point. The overall writing and story for a film should never be sacrificed for the sake of spectacle and subversion yet the writers of these movies and shows seem to think that's now compulsory.This movie has some quality moments, the acting is overall good with some being exceptional (Jonathan Majors as Kang being the standout), some of the comedy definately got a good laugh and some of the creative elements they did with the world and the action set pieces was next level. However, all this really is the icing on the cake with the overall cake being the story you're telling and the cake was so flavourless and inconsistent its impossible to go a few minutes without questioning everything that's happening.Characters being shown in one situation then magically being in a different one next time they're on screen, the most unbelievably convenient, infinitely impossible moments just landing right in the characters laps like magic, gaping plot holes that completely break the universe and immersion, terrible comedy usually at the expense and detriment of the script/story, clunky/rushed CGI, main characters being completely forgotten about and sidelined for the whole movie (Feeling very sorry for Evangeline Lilly, The Wasp is completely underutilised and has been turned from a character into a cog to keep the other characters moving along. The fact that this movie is called ""Ant-Man and the Wasp is quite frankly a joke.), subverted, meaningless plot twists that make zero sense and of course... mcguffins.Marvel... This is really your big kick off for Phase 5?This is obviously a spoiler-free review but the tricky thing about these reviews (which I think Disney also likes to bank on) is obviously a majority of people who haven't seen the movie will be avoiding any reviews with spoilers but without going into the spoilers its impossible to describe just how meaningless this movie and so many other MCU movies have been recently.If you go to these movies to switch your brain off completely and enjoy the comedy and visuals then you'll have a great time however if thats what you're paying disney and these hack writers for then I suggest either waiting until it releases on streaming services or putting on a comedy podcast and finding a few different 4K youtube visualiser's to stare at for 2 hours instead. You might save some money and also hit Disney's pockets just enough they decide to actually start caring about the content they put out.If you're going to these movies to follow the stories and the characters you've cared about for well over a decade you will leave feeling deflated and confused, only feeling more deflated and confused the more time passes by and you chew on what you just watched.Fully done with the MCU now as are a plethora of other people, the universe is so broken and messy that Marvel might as well reboot the whole universe and start from scratch now that they've acquired all the properties that they have.If you still want to watch this movie just wait until its out on streaming, as I mentioned this movie has some redeeming qualities but nowhere near enough to make it worth your money. The writing weighs this film down like a dingy loaded with a ton of lead."
6," No where near as good as the first two, but still good fun
",elijahgcasey,/user/ur160468195/,24 February 2023,"This film disappointed. This film disappointed and surprised. It was not mind-bending or humorous , but it was fun.So it revolves around a man we all know and love, Scott Lang (AKA Paul Rudd). He is an Avenger, a dad and admired by all ages. So his teenage daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) creates a quantum satellite, which gets sent and angers people (Pixels, anyone?). So instead of an agreement, they get pulled into a bizarre universe dictated by Kang the Conqueror (Jonathon Majors, The best of the bunch) who tries to manipulate them and lead them to a chaotic, eye catching quest.Not too bad."
6," Marvel Outing Designed Only for Kang
",Silver5963,/user/ur154978320/,24 February 2023,"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania was a very enjoyable movie, filled with lovely visuals and fun characters, but does it pass as a good movie? Possibly not. Here's why:M. O. D. O. K. - Ok, let's get this one out the way with first of all. Seems like everyone either loves or hates what they did with M. O. D. O.(F). K., but I fall on the side of those who thought he was a great addition! It was a smart story move to have Darren Cross, Yellowjacket, become M. O. D. O. K. After his fight with Ant-Man in the first movie. Although his stretched CGI face may look somewhat off, M. O. D. O. K. Served as a comedic villain (let's be honest, no one could possibly take a floating head seriously, so comedy was the only route for him), who rather humorously dubs himself an Avenger before dying. Hopefully they will bring another M. O. D. O. K. Variant at some point in the future! Perhaps Patton Oswalt from the TV Series 'M. O. D. O. K'?Kang the Conqueror - While Jonathan Majors gives a very good performance as Kang, I feel the writing did him a disservice. This iteration of Kang supposedly killed countless avengers, yet he was unable to stop Ant-Man and The Wasp or the giant swarm of ants and rebels, which kind of undermines him as a characters, especially if he's meant to be one of the most evil variants, so bad that all of the other Kangs exiled him to the Quantum realm. Some things just don't add up there and I think that if Kang is meant to be a bigger threat than Thanos, I hope that the writers have a good plan for Kang, because at the moment, things aren't looking the most promising.Star Wars? - I can't help but notice a LOT of similarities between this movie and Star Wars. Let's take a closer look: there are many strange alien races, a hunter (trading Boba Fett for M. O. D. O. K.?), a ruthless leader of an Empire (Kang literally uses the Force!), and even a cantina scene! I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but it certainly is a bit derivative. Either way, this movie carried the fun whimsical aspects of Star Wars into it, so it worked well in the end.No Main Character Deaths? - Perhaps this movie would've been better if Kang had actually killed one of the main characters, like in the fight with Ant-Man, he could have easily killed him to establish how powerful he really is. Either way, Kang would have seemed far more reputable as the big bad he's supposed to be. Would've been a good surprise too for the audience.Time - The Lang/Pym/Van Dyne family get sucked into the Quantum realm and have to find a way out while stopping Kang from escaping. They get back out and barely any time seems to have passed. Last time Scott Lang was in the Quantum Realm, he emerged and five years had passed. Janet Van Dyne was in there for 30 years! So how exactly does time work in this then, or just purely works for convenience?All in all, there is a LOT to discuss about this movie's ups and downs. It's not perfect by ANY means but it is a really enjoyable experience though so I would definitely recommend it!"
6," Ordinary-Average Marvel movie
",olcare,/user/ur98064456/,24 February 2023,"There's not much to say about the movie, to be honest. Every year, we've been watching a lot of average Marvel movies, series, and mini-series.The worst thing about this film was that it had a lot of problems showing Kang's power, especially in the scene where Ant-Man and Wasp fought him in the last scene, the cheesiness annoyed me.The acting, script, directorial skill, even the progress and handling of the revolutionary theme in the final scene, everything was very normal and ordinary. We've seen too many similar things in many works.The part I liked was the good visualization of the quantum dimension, which was very Star Wars themed. Especially the first scene with quantum was great in the cinema. Also, the adaptation of MODOK character to the cinematic universe was good, but his dialogues and death made me extremely sad because they were bad.In short, there was nothing extra in the movie, it was watchable but the forced joke attempts and poorly executed villain characters ruined the movie. Marvel needs to be more careful now, and realize that spending a lot of money doesn't make a good movie. I think the writers, especially in Phase 4, need to accept the fact that they are doing a bad job and choose a different path. Finally, I should add that the mid-credit scene was really bad, the voice changing was cringe-worthy. It's an average movie that can be watched."
1," Not funny, horrible story
",jaalmagu,/user/ur108716747/,24 February 2023,"I don't know where to begin. This was worse than wakanda forever and Love and Thunder which were quite bad. The story is horrific. Plot holes everywhere, and way overuse of the same tropes over and over throughout the movie. Whoever is in charge kf the current marvel jokes needs to to be fired. Maybe just put Michael Pina back in since he was the funniest part of ant man. This movie even made Paul Rudd look bad which is very difficult to do!Trying not to spoil anything specific, but if you really want to see this, wait until Disney plus, unless you have amc or regal movie pass then I guess you could justify it if you want to waste time or hate yourself or if you like to ""hate watch"" movies. Or watch it ironically as a joke."

More bright n' shiny cgi strobing to distract the drooling screengazers from the total absence of a coherent plot or a single believable, compelling character. It's all just a big amorphous slurry of multiverses, timeloops and contrivances at this point.

4," Paul Rudd carried as usual
",jmeaklim-75668,/user/ur162668649/,24 February 2023,"The movie was weak, simple as that.Paul Rudd's humour is close to any deadpool movie, where the humour outweighs the irrelevant plot. The plot with Janet was incredibly rushed and not expanded nearly enough. Marvels main issue is they feel they have to finish a movie in one. Kang was an extremely powerful character, only for Marvel to completely waste him in the final ten minutes of the movie in a trope which for Marvel has been overused immensely. You can tell that Disney has lost the reigns of Marvel due to bringing Loki back. New creatures were very Star Wars like but still nice to see, Paul Rudd was great as usual. The plot was so rushed though, really disappointed in this film."

My official score would be about an 8.8 out of 10 stars or maybe a 9.2 out of 10 stars, just because twice in the beginning of the film a character keeps something a secret for no real reason. But after that it is smooth sailing! Kang is a freaking beast! The special effects are great, the action doesn't disappoint, you get everything! A slugfest, shoot outs, battlefield action. They really did this well. The humor this there but doesn't take away from the movie's grand scope. This is the kind of movie you will be mad at yourself for if you do not watch it on a big screen! Characters are well developed. You do not have to worry about any kind of forced political or social messages, so yes it is safe for kids to watch.Who are these reviewers ranking it so low and why??? What movie did they watch? Trust me, this is an outstanding Marvel movie. It makes up for Thor 4 being trash. I liked the first Ant-Man movie, I honestly hardly even remember the second Ant-Man movie; but for Ant-Man 3 I can tell you this feels more like an Avengers movie because of how epic it feels and I am not complaining! Totally worth the price of admission! I can not watch to watch this again. I might even rewatch Loki season 1 before I watch this when it drops on Disney plus.

",ceojonathanmontgomery,/user/ur157733223/,24 February 2023,"I am a movie guy and you have to take each movie for what it is. You can't judge a movie based on another in a totally different category. This movie is a movie based on comic books and a universe created by comic writers and artists.The visuals in this movie were amazing. It was like they gave the artist an unlimited amount of micro doses and said create creatures however you want. Let your minds run wild. Since you and I can't prove it a quantum realm exists or not since humans can't do this yet. The physics and creatures can be whatever they want them to be. For that aspect of the movie it was amazing and mind boggling. The universe was amazing and stunning.Now Modoc was certainly the comic relief and made me laugh every time I saw him. He was such a joke and lame villain. But he was always one of the lamest villains in the marvel universe. Kane the Conqueror is a logical Main villain from Thanos. Especially if you have seen Disney Plus's Loki series. Where Ant Man is super small, Loki is above our universe. So they are showing the multiverse and different realms of space, time and physics. I think these types of movies are entertaining and hopefully inspire kids to want to grow up to do something in the sciences. My son since he was 3 has wanted to build robots thanks to movies like this and 11 now still strongly wants to be an engineer. So hopefully these movies do nothing else but inspire children.Now the acting and story we're not anything to cry over or win awards over. I get that. But it is a comic book movie and it is fun and entertaining which is what movies need to be today. In this sad, trouble, hate filled world we live in. We need people to smile and laugh and have a moment of fun."

The villain was pretty bad*ss for sure. Always great to see original cast. Wasnt as comical as the others but was ok. Modok was an interesting character lol. Katy M. O'Brian Was a total bad*ss in this film she can kick some butt for sure. Kathryn Newton, I feel was a strong character in the film. He didn't like the dynamics between her and Paul Rudd mashed well. Bill Murray was interesting to see in one of these films lol but my favorite fish are all the different species were totally totally awesome."
6," It just didn't work
",jonnaharkenson,/user/ur132381721/,24 February 2023,"Ant-Man 1 and 2 were much better movies for many reasons compared to Ant-Man 3 Quantumania. The first film felt more like a non superhero film with low stakes but still a lot of character building, Scott Lang recently gets out of prison but is trying hard to win back his daughter. The first and second Ant-Man film as laugh out loud funny, and especially the second film which probably is the funniest Marvel superhero movie ever (yes, funnier than Deadpool 1 and 2 which I didn't think were all that funny). The 3rd Ant-Man film was not that funny, though there were a few funny moments but I didn't really laugh out loud, the humor felt more like cartoon humor for children while the previous films were funny for both adults and children alike. Speaking of it being for children, the Ant-Man 3 film felt like it was heavily ""Disneyfied"" with much less violence and the violence seem like it has been toned down, plus there was no kiss at the end when Ant-Man and the Wasp saved the day which made it feel like there's no chemistry between the two. Hope's father, Hank, was barely in the 3rd film, while he was integral in the first two films. The 2nd Ant-Man film had way more action sequence, and the buildup was much better (especially when Hank finally reunites with Janet after like 30 years, getting into the Quantum realm to save her finally, and plus they actually kissed unlike Hope and Scott in Ant-Man 3... so the the love between the characters felt more real in the previous films). The boring thing in Ant-Man 3 is they used the same old trope of inspiring the common folk to rise up and fight back against the oppressors, very similar to many movies like Star Wars, Dune, Lord of the Rings, etc. It just felt outdated for a big movie in 2023. It seems like Disney is going to far with the campiness, just like they did in Thor 4 Love and Thunder which that film and Ant-Man 3 felt like it was a movie mostly meant for kids to watch. I guess it's a money making strategy to make it very family friendly and light hearted but it starts to become stale and people get sick of it. A lot of people diss the DC films like Man of Steel (2013) or Zack Snyder's Justice League saying it's too serious and not funny/campy enough, but looking back, I think people are now realizing that these films have more depth and an artistic feel to it.But enough of the bad stuff, the movie did do some good things. Paul Rudd has great comedic timing as always, and he is always likable no matter what. There were some funny scenes such as when Hank gets jealous of Lord Krylar (played by Bill Murray). Jonathan Majors did a great job as Kang, the acting was good.Disney and Marvel kind of ruined this film. The thing that makes Marvel so big and popular is also the thing that is ruining their movies, they are a double edged sword. They wanted everything in the MCU to connect, so they used Ant-Man 3 to introduce the big bad guy, Kang... And they want to introduce a future young hero, Cassie (Ant-Girl), and have her in a future young Avengers movie. The first two films didn't really have anything to do with the main story of the MCU, except only in the end credits scenes. And then Marvel and Disney's obsession with making campy kid friendly films, and the heavily reduced violence disliking kissing in the movies for some reason (no kiss in Ant-man 3, no kissing in the first Disney Star Wars movie). Many have said people are ""burnt out"" seeing superhero films... But I don't think that's necessarily true, I think people are tired of the same old stuff and the movies becoming far too light hearted to the point where people don't even take it seriously anymore. Hence why I mentioned earlier about the early DC movies (ones written by Christopher Nolan, like the Dark Knight trilogy and Man of Steel), these films feel more than just superhero films as they have more seriousness and depth which makes it feel like a non superheroe film. But if you're going to make a funny movie, then make it funny like the first and second Ant-Man films, maybe they should have gotten Paul Rudd involved with the writing to help the jokes land better... And they need to make a movie that adults could enjoy, not just only for kids. I give it a 6 out of 10 because I still enjoyed it somewhat but it was disappointing."
8," I enjoy being inside the Quantum Realm!!
",paulnguyen-94886,/user/ur84407747/,23 February 2023,"I saw it earlier this week and I really enjoy it. Jonathan Majors as Kang was so good and finally Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, Kathryn Newton as Cassie, Evangeline Lily as Wasp, Michelle as Janet and Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank were good...I like that the stakes were high for this Ant-Man movie because he hasn't a villain that was dangerous like Kang in the last two movies and I can feel it in the movie...Ready for more of KANG! I'm glad, it was a darker sci-fi tone for the movie. The visual and CGI is great even though a lot of people in this world, will always complain about it for every Marvel movie that has come out. Very good action, laughs and more!! The two credits scene was so good. I can say, that people already watched it and don't like, will regret it when they could bring back a clip from this movie in the future like movie Avengers Kang Dynasty because how important the plot for Kang will be in Kang Dynasty. Just like in Avengers Endgame and they bring scene from Thor Dark World which we can agree it was not good but it's was important to the story that's been told. I personally, really enjoy this movie! I don't know why it's getting a lot of hate...Because, it's really easy to follow. Go Watch It!!!!"
6," Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania
",CinemaSerf,/user/ur107065132/,23 February 2023,"""Oh, Daddy - It's all my fault!"". Well no ""Cassie"" (Kathryn Newton), not quite. You certainly developed the piece of communications kit that lands everyone in the quantum soup, but the blame really must go to Peyton Reed and Jeff Loveness for directing and writing this latest emanation from Marvel's increasingly un-special film factory. It starts off with a great little device that could quickly put Papa John's out of business before we are sucked into the cantina from ""Star Wars"" (1977) where our recently arrived travellers find themselves pursued by the ridiculously un-menacing ""M. O. D. O. K"" - a sort of robotic killing version of the golden statue from the top of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) after it had had a good time with ""V. I. N. C. E. N. T"" from ""The Black Hole"" (1979) - before Michelle Pfeiffer ""Janet"" explains to her family (and to us) just what has led them to a predicament where they must avoid the evil clutches of ""Kang the Conqueror"" (Jonathan Majors). Now this gift that keeps on giving for this studio never struggles to impress visually, and the imagination of those who create these magical effects and alien shapes and sizes must be commended. However, this latest offering featuring, in my view, the weakest of their arsenal of characters is just entirely derivative and unremarkable. Aside from a very few bon-mots from Paul Rudd the dialogue is dry and the action scenes are all concentrated in one or two sequences whilst the rest of this serves as little better than colourful padding for the thinnest of storylines. Rudd is quite an unassuming kind of actor. Engaging, yes - but somehow just too lightweight for the grandness of the surrounding imagery. Michael Douglas (""Pym"") features sparingly and the cameo from Bill Murray might have worked better in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" - here it is almost laughable. If these are to keep coming off the production line as thickly and quickly as seems likely, then somebody somewhere is going to have to spend much more effort on developing stronger and more compelling stories because the audiences are surely immune to the vibrancy of the special effects by now. This is really forgettable fayre."
5," An Ok Ant-Man
",kccord-57303,/user/ur87299098/,23 February 2023,"It was ok, weakest of the Ant-Man series. The original cast was great with what they had to work with. Kathryn Newton though was the weakest link. I did not care for her performance (unless a whiny teenager was her goal). She has been fine in other projects but as Cassie no. On the other side Jonathan Majors was great as Kang The Conqueror. Looking foward to see Kang in his full potential. I can honestly say this movie suffered from too much cgi. Half way through the movie I started losing interest in it. It was like Star Wars meets the Guardians of the Galaxy. Also was that the best they could do for M. O. D. O. K? It looked silly. I'm a big Marvel and DC fan, but this movie is slightly above The Eternals. Saw it once no need to see it again."

5," The Marvel Movie That Finally Broke Me
",MovieTim14,/user/ur55655796/,23 February 2023,"I'm among the many who felt that Marvel has largely been on the decline in their Post-Endgame glut of content. I hemmed and hawed about my commitment to the brand as I continued to turn up for everything they put out regardless. Now that Ant-Man 3 has released as the official kickoff to Marvel's Phase 5, I'm finally ready to cut the cord, as the lack of quality in their recent content has reached a new nadir.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a soulless product, and its value rests solely in being a set-up for what Marvel will be doing in the future. The first 10 minutes or so were actually promising, starting with the good natured fun and humor of the previous Ant-Man movies, and setting up potentially interesting (though also out of left field?) character conflict. Once our cast is thrown into the Quantum Realm however (thanks to the daddy of all Deus Ex Machinas), there is little to grasp onto to enjoy the remaining runtime.The writing is atrocious, from its structure, to dialogue, plot contrivances, and even signature Marvel humor. The potentially interesting character conflict it sets up in the beginning is thrown to the wayside to make way for endless plot and exposition, as it's made clear that the priority is setting up what Marvel has in store in the future, rather than focusing on the characters in the current movie. A couple of lines are thrown out here and there to try to round out the paper-thin attempts at theme and character development, but they amount to nothing. Ultimately, there wasn't a single thing that did not ring hollow to my ears, and even a cast as effortlessly charming and talented as Ant-Man's could do little to convince me otherwise.The other component of the one-two punch that made the film so joyless to me is the physical setting of the movie. I was amazed (not in a good way) that Marvel had the confidence to set 95% of the movie in an entirely CGI realm, without providing any sense of physical reality for us to grasp onto. This is especially intriguing given that this is an Ant-Man movie, and the characters' size-altering powers are only interesting in comparison to other physical objects that the viewer can inherently understand. I also found the Quantum Realm to be, for lack of a better word, ugly. To clarify, I don't mean the route they decided to take with creature and environment design, which some could find kind of gross. The entirety of everything just amounts to something I found aesthetically unpleasant. I would never revisit this movie as something just to look at.There are a few redeeming factors. Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang was excellent, managing to lend a sense of gravitas to the happenings of the movie in spite of my total lack of investment. I also will never be able to hate dumb action and comic book goofiness, and at least some of the jokes are fairly funny. To be clear though, those standards should be the bare minimum for a film of this nature, and that is the only bar that is cleared here.When Scorsese made his ""superhero movies are only theme park rides"" comments that set the internet ablaze years ago, I was part of the camp that thought they have so much more to offer than what he was willing to see. His analogy has never been more apt than with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, however, and it's a ride that I think I'll remember more for making me want to throw up than for wanting to go on it again."

Not cringy as Thor. And I know people have different opinions about this.There were some plot holes and things that didn't make sense in the quantum realm and this applies to the rest of the movie as well.It's also important to watch this movie as it's an introduction to the next Marvel movies, especially as shown in the two after-credit scenes."

",goiabinhadobem,/user/ur152521004/,23 February 2023,"What is that movie?I went to watch it whiteout expectations, but what I see is one of the worst movies of superheroes of all time
Unbelievable script, horrible edition showing and cutting flashbacks without explications, uninteresting characters, what is that character that need holes?, and the end is unbelievable, the vilan who will destroy the multiverse loses the fight for a group of ants??? I don't belive it.Design of MODOK it's nearly comic, his dialogue with cassie is one of the worse dialogues of all time.The jokes went ALL in wrong time, they are fighting with kang and hank apologize that he's late and the jokes with modok saying that he died as a avanger and that hope is pretty now, just unbelievable.Scott part when he's walking around the street is shamming.The only things that can be saved in that movie are some parts of the CGI that is good in almost everything, just bad at the time when scott and cassie arrives at the quantum universe and kang that's has a good base material, but is wasted with the script."
7," It's okay for a standalone movie, but for setting up Phase 5. . .
",chgames-28385,/user/ur135574361/,23 February 2023,"Let's start out with this, I had no big expectations for this Marvel film like I did with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and there was a reason why. I wasn't expecting much from this movie, plus I wasn't a big Ant-Man fan to even begin with . . . The previous Ant-Man movies didn't leave much lasting impressions on me, and I was meh about the whole series and the superhero in genreal. So when I heard that this movie was coming out, well of course I was going to see it opening weekend just so I could be on top of the game of seeing it, and not being ruined by the movie. I wasn't seeing this because I was really interested into it . . . Not really, anyhow. But after watching this movie twice in theaters the same day, I can say this: it falls short of what I was hoping it would be, but it deliver a solid set up for Phase 5!I'm not really into the Multiverse, Time Variants, and the Quantum Realm because they just make not only my heard hurt just thinking too much of them, but it makes the MCU timeline even more confusing (than it should be). So to begin with, I wasn't into the Quantum Realm so I could care less if they explored it or not, or if they got trapped in it or not. It was just another big expansion on the MCU side just to get more revenue in, is how I see it. But after watching this movie, I guess you could say it got me to enjoy the Quantum Realm a tad bit better, and fully appreciate all the bright visuals and colors they did to make the Quantum come alive. I mean, beautiful world an all, but I could still care less.This movie sets up not only Phase 5 very well, but the villain for it quite amazingly! If you're like me, you could agree that Phase 4 was a very weak and if I'm going to be honest, a bit unneeded Phase. The only two movies that carried the whole Phase 4 on its back was Spider-Man: No Way Home and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. No other mentionable movie that was released during Phase 4 made the best impression (although: Doctor Strange 2 could make it). So after an exhaustable Phase 4, we finally move on to I hope a better Phase, Phase 5. Now look, if Marvel/Disney does this right, Phase 5 could be the most interesting Phase since Phase 3!Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania by itself was a decent, average movie that had its moments while also having their cringy moments also. But for the beginning/start-up of Phase 5, not going to lie: it sets up Phase 5 very well. We get introduced to not exactly the most menacing/mean villain of all time, but it's the powers he has and its the other variants of him that just may make Phase 5 villain(s) the most interesting to watch . . . To see how Marvel and Disney unfolds his intentions, his powers, and the affect he'll have in the MCU timeline (that is, if they do it right of course). Kang was an interesting villian in this movie . . . He was played by a Johnathon Majors who actually did a great job, so I'm excited to see more of him in later Marvel films. Johnathon Majors has potential in the MCU, and if Marvel and Disney does it right, it may just be the biggest role Johnathon has played in his movie career . . . Or it could be the somewhat of a downfall, just depending on how Marvel and Disney plays out Kang.But Ant-Man just being a standalone movie in its series does farily alright. I think the beginning struggled to catch my attention. I think the first time watching it I was just waiting for Kang to appear on the screen, and kind of caring less of what playing at the moment. People/Critics alike raved about Johnathon Majors' performance, so of course I wanted to see if hey did actually a good job . . . And after watching it, I think he did a great job! But this movie has some interesting points that they brought to the table; maybe I could have taken the whole thing serisously if the 3rd act of the movie didn't just go a bit out of hand. I felt like the 3rd act of the movie was the downfall of the movie. It's just got a bit out of hand and that cringy speech in that movie didn't help at the least.The 1st and 2nd act were interesting enough, but my favorite moments were when we were trying to understand the villian Kang a bit more. He was easily the best part about the movie, and outshadowing everyone's elses role in the movie, and not lying here. He's just a villian we have never gotten before, so I'm interested on how they're going to handle Kang, and he might be one of my favorite villians that has been brought to big screen. The other characters in the movie that weren't main characters like Scott and Hope, were more or less so unmemorable and they were in the shawdows in a lot of the movie. So basically, any characters in the movie that didn't have a big role were sidelined people who were underused in the movie.M. O. D. O. K. Was the worst character in the movie and also one of the most unneeded too. I struggled to comprehend/digest him fully, and to be honest I could really care less about him. He wasn't an annoying character, he was just one that made me question why we even have him in the movie to begin with. But besides that character, this movie undergoes a lot of underused characters, and more or less put them in the shadows. Really unfortunate that we didn't get to understand these people in the Quantman Realm more.Besides some questionable choices for the movie, a cringy speech, a 3rd act getting a bit out of hand, characters being underused, and a character not needed, this movie is a bit solid. For being a standalone Ant-Man movie it was okay, but for setting up Phase 5 and its villian, it did a great job! It was a movie that I enjoyed more on my secondtime and understood more. It's not I would want to see over and over, but it's one that I'm glad I saw how they setted up Phase 5!"
7," A tiny but mighty addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe
",rezaeirhamid,/user/ur162605620/,23 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a tiny but mighty addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Paul Rudd returns as Scott Lang, and he's still as charming and hilarious as ever. From the opening scene, you're immediately reminded of what makes this character so fun to watch. He's just an ordinary guy who happens to have a suit that allows him to shrink and grow at will. That's it. And yet, he still manages to get into all sorts of trouble.The movie also introduces us to some new characters, including Kang the Conqueror, who's played by Jonathan Majors. Kang is a time-traveling villain who's unlike anything we've seen before in the MCU. He's arrogant, powerful, and has a wicked sense of humor. Majors absolutely nails the role, and his interactions with Rudd are some of the funniest moments in the movie.Of course, we can't forget about the Wasp, played by the always fantastic Evangeline Lilly. She's every bit as skilled and badass as she was in the first movie, but she's also given more depth and nuance in this one. We get to see more of her relationship with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and we also get to see her struggle with the consequences of her actions.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a hilarious, action-packed adventure that's sure to delight fans of the MCU. Paul Rudd is once again the standout, but the entire cast is excellent, and the story is a lot of fun. Whether you're a die-hard Marvel fan or just looking for a good laugh, this movie is definitely worth checking out."

Well, this was before watching this boring movie.Ant-man , a little guy DEFEATED kang by ANTS.yes , a bunch of ""class -2 ""ants with laser guns that lived a 1000 years due to time dilation and evolved enough to start a civilisation and DEFEAT kang . The guy who butchered a million universes . Yay, kang lost to some ants.Kang's powers were inconsistent . He killed freedom fighters using lasers and when team antman arrives , kang stops using his powers and it becomes a fist fight.The real kang would have mopped the floor with ants.Kang can stop time and those ants would have frozen. Kang could have used lasers. No he doesn't use any of them and just activates a shield and BARELY Holds those ants on his own. You want me to believe that THIS guy , who lost to some ants and ONE avenger be a multiversal time - controlling omnipotent avengers-level threat? Sorry not buying that.Beside that , the first act of this movie is slow , like too slow with that classic "" I didn't tell you because I wanna protect you ""trope.The trailers made my hype for kang touch the skies .

6," Third time's not a charm...
",isabelleskogh,/user/ur153232593/,23 February 2023,"I wanna start off with saying that I had really high hopes for this Ant-Man sequel, especially considering how good the other two movies are. My personal favorite will always be ""Ant-Man & The Wasp"" and so I was hoping for ""Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania"" to be an equally good continuation, but found myself being let down. We all know what the general rule is; the more sequels, the lesser the quality. I personal feel that Marvel usually succeeds at this while most others fail, although there has been several sequels lately that just isn't as good as expected. But still, in my excitement for the third return of one of my favorite Marvel heroes, I was very hopeful for this movie. All in all, it was better than some of the other Marvel sequels I've seen recently and that's mostly because of Paul Rudd and the overall casting of the Ant-Man movies, alongside a well-rounded script that contains both action and comedy. I however was disappointed in the development of Cassie Lang, both the fictional character and the new actress. I loved Cassie in the first two movies and while I realize why they needed an older actress post-Endgame, I still feel they could've done better. I also would've liked to see more of Scott and Hope's romantic relationship, as well as the Lang/Pym/Van Dyne family dynamic. This movie was obviously very much about introducing the Kang character, which I was not impressed with at all. In the end, what I'm left with is a feeling of unfulfillment and putting even higher expectations on a future Ant-Man sequel to give me the same joy as the first two..."

",cherinpaulm,/user/ur134581946/,23 February 2023,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been a disappointment for the past couple of years, with missed opportunities and isolated writing focused more on streaming series than good movie plots. Even with a new movie, the MCU failed to get back on track and introduce a new villain without proper development or pace. It's hard to invest in a plot that's not interesting and lacks character development. Despite the nice visuals, the movie is paper-thin with weak characters and distracting acting. It's a shame to see the decline of superhero movies, and it's hard to imagine that it won't get worse from here."

It's not one of the best, but it's not bad at all.Don't forget that this movie was shot at the time of the pandemic and I believe it took some extra work and adjustments.In my opinion I was only concerned about two things, the fact that Scott starts to become associated with a comical, sometimes awkward character and another is that on one hand we see a very comic book-like Cassie, but on the other hand it seems that there is a blockage on the part of Kevin Feige's team to be faithful to the elements of the ""original story"", which bothers me a bit being a fan of the comics - in short, that's my opinion.I really enjoyed Kang, all the content, and I confess I was apprehensive about the MODOK presentation, but I was fascinated by the work that was done.To like a Marvel movie you have to understand this universe, and I still think that many of the people who rate it negatively don't know what they are talking about at all.Conclusion, good movie...not perfect, and by far to be one of the best.I really hope they grab these new characters that are appearing (America Chavez, Ms Marvel, Cassie Lang, Kate Bishop...) and give the ""Young Avengers"" a future because I think it could work well."
5," Surprisingly disappointing pass this one up
",spencer-w-hensley,/user/ur47032916/,23 February 2023,"Ant Man from 8 years ago didn't really look like something I would enjoy but it was a smart and very well done superhero action movie.The first sequel which came along three years later was also very good and was just as much of not even mildly better than its predecessor. The big key there was good writing, action sequences and introducing Michelle Pfieffer as Janet Van Dyne a role which proved a good fit for her.Adding in Bill Murray to this installment as well as my admiration for the other two films left me very excited for part 3.However it was also somewhat concerning that they were releasing it so early in the year in February as the previous films were both summer blockbusters.Granted Hollywood has taken the traditional dump months of January and February in the last decade and released some good if not great films (Black Panther the original was a good example of this) so it wasn't a huge concern but did seem rather odd they didn't release it in July as Ant Man seems more like a summer type of movie anyways.Then the reviews came in. Critics can be wrong but I have found if the reviews are bad for a Marvel movie then they are usually spot on.Good examples of this were Eternals which was trash in my opinion and the critics were right in saying so, and the most recent Thor putting recieved mixed reviews and as a result was just very average.The good news is the movie could have been worse the bad news is it's barely any better than Eternals which was horrible.The story just doesn't have enough action and is way too slow and while Majors an slang, Newton as Cassie and Murray as Krylar give their very best in their roles, Rudd, Lilly, Pfieffer and Douglas all seem less energetic than usual and don't even look like they are having a good time and share the audiences sympathy that they are just as tired of this series as we now are.Murray's cameo was a standout but he's barely in the movie and unless he had an expanded role it's a waste of his talent.The pacing is also very sluggish which really hurts the movie even more compared to its predecessors and other Marvel entries.Hollywood needs to remember why we fell in love with these movies and stick to the formula that makes them good.Being mildly disappointed with Thor 4 and very disappointed with this and Eternals I'm concerned Marvel is running out of gas a lot and they need to have a lot fresher material if they are going to continue with more sequels.Not the worst movie but a tremendous disappointment. I not only recommend you skip seeing it in theaters but I wouldn't recommend even streaming it on Disney Plus when it comes out to streaming.Stream the first two films again and save your time and money by skipping this one.I know it's already a big hit but this is a huge step down in the good quality Marvel has offered us before."
6," A Mediocre Adventure
",jasmine-creases,/user/ur162634853/,23 February 2023,"Ant Man Quantumania is a mixed bag in terms of Marvel movies. While it has its entertaining moments, the film ultimately falls flat due to several key issues.One of the major shortcomings is the lack of stakes and danger to the main character. There is no real sense of urgency or tension, and the story fails to make the audience invested in the outcome.Additionally, the film's villain is portrayed as powerful and threatening at first, but is easily defeated in the end. This not only makes the villain feel weak and forgettable, but also removes any sense of real danger for the heroes.However, the movie is not without its highlights. Paul Rudd's performance as Ant Man is enjoyable, and there are some visually stunning scenes that are a treat to watch.Overall, Ant Man Quantumania is a middle-of-the-road Marvel movie that doesn't quite reach the heights of the franchise's best entries. It's worth a watch if you're a fan of the superhero genre, but don't expect it to be a standout film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
7," Tiny Flash Gordon
",danchilton-71955,/user/ur68828911/,23 February 2023,"The problem with Marvel trying to widen the scope after the universe effecting events of Thanos and his technicolour dream glove is that the more you explore ""different"" realms the more obvious it becomes that everything is basically the same. The multiverse of ""madness"" turned out to be the universe of ""quite similar but the traffic lights are upside down"" and here the unknowable quantum realm, where physics and time don't exist in any way we understand, is just another alien world.To be fair, the alien world is a pretty cool one. There are funky creatures and weird characters, giving things a 50's B movie or Flash Gordon vibe, complete with appropriate wacky visuals. Sadly all this stuff is rushed, not really giving the chance to take in the view or enjoy fun moments, including a cameo everyone would surely love to have seen more of. You get the feeling an earlier phase of the MCU would have leaned into the ""Lost in Space"" of it all a bit more but here we have to move quickly on to the Super High Stakes. These involve Jonathon Major's Kang, played in a reserved style that makes him menacing but a little out of sync with the rest of the movie. Given he is from another dimension that may be the point. Kang's sidekick MODOK is a fun take on a ridiculous villian but the departure may divide comic book fans.On the hero front its good to see Michelle Pfeiffer given a substantial role and it looks as if a grown up Cassie Lang is intented to be a fixture going forward but Evangeline Lilly has such a reduced role it seems pointless keeping ""The Wasp"" as part of the title. Micheal Douglas is enjoyable when on screen but kept mostly to the periphery of proceedings and while he is having fun you can tell he isn't exactly massively invested in whats going on. Leading man Paul Rudd is, well, Paul Rudd. He brings the charm and liability to Scott Lang you've come to expect. He manages this despite being stuck with a pretty stupid character arc where he begins the film suddenly averse to helping people for no well defined reason.This is symptomatic of some fairly lazy writting in parts, with some of the most by the numbers dialogue yet seen in a Marvel movie. Fortunately there is enough visual and stylistic creativity on display to make the film more than watchable, if certainly no Giant Man of the genre.7 hyper intelligent insects out of 10 ants."

",samog-98289,/user/ur71505114/,23 February 2023,"Major spoilers in this review for everything I'm going to be talking about! First I'll start with the good parts; the only good parts of watching this film were the Welcome Back song moments by John Sebastian as for the bad things about this there were so many things wrong with this movie; why did they recast Cassie Lang?! The actress who played her in Endgame showed a lot more emotion than Kathryn Newton plus she was a pain in the bum! The dialogue is awful & the writing was atrocious! There were so many plotholes; if Kang killed any Avengers which ones did he kill? Also, why didn't Janet tell Hope and Hank about Kang earlier?! They completely ruined MODOK with Darren Cross coming back from the first Ant-Man movie! The post-credit scenes are disappointing setting up The Kang Dynasty (which I won't be watching) & Loki Season 2! Overall this start to M-She-U Phase 5 is not looking good, the worst CGI of any marvel film I've ever seen and is much worse than Iron Man 3! That's why I'm giving this a 6/10! I don't feel like watching this again if I did it would be with my Mum! ;-)"
9," Awesome Movie
",talentvidya01,/user/ur162631553/,23 February 2023,"St got back from this movie and to my surprise I had a really good time watching it. The amount of hate this movie is getting is genuinely stupid given how this was one of the better movies Marvel has put out recently. This movie does have some negatives to it mostly just consisting of some cringey dialogue and some actors not really selling the characters for me but in the grand scheme of the film it really didn't bother me that much. The humour is actually not too bad, definitely some lines which felt abit unnecessary at times but I did find myself laughing a decent bit throughout the film (mostly at MODOK, everytime he appears on screen you cannot help but laugh). I feel with the time they were given on this picture the CGI is very impressive given as they couldn't go to the Quantum Realm to film and they didn't have 11 years to work on this like Avatar did."

",gonzalopez-10431,/user/ur92593929/,23 February 2023,"They're just making movies to make movies.1. Story is so predictable and soulless. Seems like the script is written by a kid, time and time again, the same formula is used to write movies. Besides that, many things didn't even make sense, the writers didn't know how to solve situations so they just created quick fixes to get to the next scene.2. Trying too hard to make characters likable. The daughter was the hero and the citizens empathized with her speech... WHY? She did nothing! If anything the ant guru saved the day, it all feels forced.3. Disappointing villain. They introduce a villain that is really powerful just to be defeated by the bare minimum."
8," A Movie That Doesn't Have To Apologize
",amadour-87687,/user/ur106752841/,23 February 2023,"Wakanda Forever is the best a Comic book movie can hope to be. It treats the genre seriously and with respect. Ant Man Quantum Mania does too. Despite the lightheartedness of the first two movies (which I loved), it delivers as a story carrying a foreboding message that something bad is coming. It gives us a glimpse at the evil destined to infect our corner of the multiverse soon. A lot of very qualified actors flop badly trying to play comic book heroes/villains. In fact the more accomplished actors seem to do the worst. But the cast of this movie is first rate! All of them, from villain to hero and everyone in between. When I saw Bill Murray I figured ""of lord, here comes Love and Thunder"" again! But Bill was great-a little under used but right on target. Michelle Pfeiffer gave the movie some heart, and unbelievably at her age, some sex appeal. And whoever crafted the scene to restore what had been destroyed, created a work of pure genius in special effects and script writing. I really liked this movie-just not as much as Wakanda Forever!"
6," Ant-Man Episode III: Revenge of the Kang
",cedricdumler,/user/ur70857921/,23 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is fine. It's nowhere near Marvel's best and has some serious structural and writing issues, but also contains very strong elements that overall make me come out at the positive side.That is mostly owed to Jonathan Majors, who's since Loki up there with the MCU's finest and most fascinating antagonists. His performance is chillingly clinical and powerful. He owns the screen in an almost shakespearean way and - if handled well for Loki S2, Avengers 5&6 and Co. - could very well end up becoming a historic villain for cinema like Thanos and Joker. Putting him against Ant-Man is a genius paring. The humour that goes hand in hand with Scott Lang contrasts the seriousness of Kang beautifully.The rest of the performances are all very good. Paul Rudd is born to play Scott Lang, bringing in his natural witt and charm as loveable as ever.Kathryn Newton is a nice addition to the Marvel family, although I do think the chemistry between her and Rudd leaves space for improvement. Michelle Pfeiffer did a great job, doing the best she can overcoming the underwhelming writing of her character. Michael Douglas was a freaking delight, we all should be thankful to have such a legend playing the role of Dr. Hank Pym. I was positively surprised about the size of his role, he gets way more to do than in the last film. He also is the star in the coolest scene of the whole movie. (Ant-Charge!)Where this film really lets down is the second act. There's an aesthetic emptiness to everything that felt almost soul-crushing to me who so deeply connects to the MCU and it's lifelike world.The writing of Janet was really annoying. She hummed and hawed around with everything she was doing and hesitated to inform her family about Kang for nearly 1 and a 1/2 hour straight until she suddenly broke out with the whole backstory of the two. Jeff Loveness has a big issue with dramaturgically natural script / character / dialogue development.The third act, with Kang moving into the spotlight, gladly comes with an almost gargantuan shift in quality and tone. It also suddenly boasts some really enjoyable visuals, with plenty of colour and vibrancy. The makeup, masks and costumes were really creative and I digged the Star Wars theme behind it all. The end fight with Kang and Scott was some brutal stuff and almost gave me a feeling of fear for Scott which the rest of the movie never managed to create.All in all I see lots of amazing potential for the rest of the multiverse saga, especially with Kang and his variants moving into the spotlight as we come closer to the big Avengers finale. But with Quantumania I have the clear feeling that the script was rushed to get the film out and give the audience a taste of Kang. They focused mostly on that and ultimately let down the actual stars of the movie Ant-Man and especially Wasp itself. They got sidelined in their own movie and haven't really undergone any character development. The credits in the end read: KANG WILL RETURN. I think that speaks a lot of what we take from this film.I loved the two post credit scenes, the future looks definitely exciting. But I can only hope Kevin Feige don't looses sight of what made the MCU so loved and successful since the very beginning: good writing."

The start was concerning with how mediocre it was...but when I saw the angel's face...when I saw modok...I knew that I would never be the same.

The movie was so boring that my bestie slept during movie as he felt that was the better way to get worth of his money. I barely managed to keep my eyes open as I am a huge fan of marvel.The plot itself wasn't rational, why wouldn't Janet not talk about the big bad kang to anyone, and ants at the end taking down kang was laughable. Marvel is known for its quality but CG was so bad at few places, it looks like it was done by 7 year old on MS paint.No complaints about the acting , the cast was amazing but Paul Rudd looked older than his age.Was happy to see tom in the post credit scene and the other post credit that ridiculed Kang variants looked goofy."

There's some guardian of the galaxy humour with the supporting creatures 'let's torture him' and 'I have holes'Of course like Star Wars you have you have your good and evil and the evil is played excellently by the Caesar / Genghis Kahn / Alexander the Great type empire builder Kang the conquerorGiving the film credibility you have seasoned actors Michelle Pfeifer & Michael Douglas as Mr & Mrs Pym the original ant man & wasp.Pad.

Wait for it to show on Disney if you must. Or, you could do yourself a favour and give it a wide berth. It has none of the charm of the previous two films and absolute zero jeopardy.There is nothing on the line because Kang can jump back and forward through time through multiple personalities.

This film brings real eye candy to viewers and I can guarantee any fan of The MCU is gonna like this movie.

The film ending is somewhat lackluster, also its introduction to ideas and characters that never develop rightfully drag the pace and momentum. Also the performance by actress Kathryn newton is unfortunately one of the dragging moments on screen: not convincing and plenty of occasions forceful. Paul Judd as the so called ""small guy with room to grow"" is good, but not amazing that will blow the audience away in the titular role.

4," Worse Marvel film ever
",BlackXPanda,/user/ur67457485/,22 February 2023,"Where to start, I was really looking forward to seeing this film, after 30 minutes I began to look at my watch. It was totally boring , no real story whatsoever. Only a handful of good moments mainly with the blobby thing and that's why it gets a 4 otherwise it would be lower.Most of the film takes place in the Quantum Realm but it seems at times as if it's a school play production
The big issue and is the whole problem associated with this could have been negated if Janet had told everyone what happened to her in the Quantum Realm. This in essence is what the story is all about. It's very lazy storytelling to rely on I haven't told you that to protect you."

",uvhtnxuk,/user/ur117804016/,22 February 2023,"I love Paul Rudd as Ant Man. I think he was great and the Russo brothers in particular really got him right. But this movie is a lesson on how to fail to tell a story and instead just edit together a bunch of ""moments"". They failed to land this fish.So anyway, this guy gets out of jail and starts working for Hank. And that's when he met Hope. And Hope's all like, ""I want nothing to do with you. Look at my hairdo. I'm all business."" And then Scotty's like, ""you know what, girl? My hearts all broken and I'll probably never find love again, but damn I want to kiss you!"" But then you fast forward..."
8," Stands up to rewatches
",SureCommaNot,/user/ur27127577/,22 February 2023,"I've seen this film twice and it still grips me.First off, Scott (Paul Rudd) has excellent chemistry with everyone. The way Hope shines alongside him as they fight together really shows how much a heroine she is, even though the original Wasp gets more fleshed-out here than she (which is fine, because it was Janet's turn for that). And in all his interaction with Cassie, the love feels real, the frustration feels real, and the camaraderie is 100% consistent with where her character was when she was young. I'm amazed at how much attention was paid to dramatic detail and character-arc continuity. (Some recent MCU releases have lacked in those areas.)Also, I genuinely appreciated that Scott didn't fully learn the lesson Cassie sought to instill in him (caring about the plight of strangers just as much as family members), so this leaves room for his character arc. I'm glad it wasn't instant-morality-learned-in-a-snap. And in subtle ways, she also saw that her naïveté lacked wisdom and planning. She had a lot of heart, but needed practicality. Again, room for character growth, and it was beautiful to see so much of that explored in an action film.And there were some other things left open, that I won't get into here, so I'll just say how much I appreciated that. Too many superhero movies wrap everything up in a nice little bow by the end.Finally, I loved how the movie didn't get bogged down in attempts at humor. To me it was just the right amount, and almost always felt natural. The acting chops of the cast certainly helped.Excited to see where the story goes next!"

4," So much going on, there might as well be nothing going on at all
",kyleschmidlin,/user/ur162611211/,22 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania sees the title characters and their core supporting cast sucked into the ""Quantum Realm"" within its first few minutes. How they get there is a bit silly - Scott Lang's daughter Cassie, who we've never seen much of anything from, just built a little contraption that somehow sends signals to it, and then the device abruptly sucks everyone and everything in the room into it (nice of it to stop at those four walls and not devour the entire earth).It doesn't really matter what the Quantum Realm is, though; just know that it's an alternate dimension, and the setting for pretty much the entire movie. A few of its creatures are charming - I liked the mechanoid cyclops quite a bit - but plenty of them are just basic humanoids. None of them are given a backstory, or even a name you could remember; the nearest any of them get to having a personality is the little guy filled with ooze who wishes he had holes. And the scenery is surprisingly dull; just generic, swirly nebulas that sometimes look interesting but mostly just reinforce that this movie is a gigantic, expensive cartoon. And because there is no sun to speak of, the whole movie feels tinted.It took me a little while to realize, but part of what made this movie stink is that it had none of what makes Ant-Man unique amongst superheroes. Yes, the shrinking allows them to enter the Quantum Realm, but once they're there, there's no earthly frame of reference for Ant-Man's size-shifting. Gone are the fun set-pieces of fights on toy train sets or Ant-Man being flushed down a drain. In the comics, he'd consistently face perils from things like flypaper, and that made it fun. There's nothing fun about this movie, though in typical Marvel fashion they plug in some jokes which mostly fall flat.A lot of stuff happens in Quantumania, but it all happens at breakneck speed, one scene jumping to the next with almost no time for any of it to breathe. There's a scene where Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet Van Dyne stands up to an entire army, cuts off the general's arm, then has a laugh and hugs him - turns out they were old friends, and he offers her a ride. But he's never heard from again, and it's just straight onto the next thing. That pacing might work in some comics, but it doesn't work as a film. It's just two hours of things flying in and out of the story. And the result is possibly the worst thing you can have in a superhero movie: it's boring. When it's constant suspense, nothing actually feels suspenseful. There's no rise and fall in the dramatic or narrative tension.The lone highlight was Jonathan Majors as Kang. His performance was great, and the look was just right for an MCU-stylized version of the classic costume. But the character felt inconsistent. He's an all-powerful conqueror across space and time but he needs Janet Van Dyne's help to repair his ship. He can incinerate hordes of rebels with a single blast but for some reason puts that weapon away to fight the Ant family hand-to-hand.I can really only recommend this movie to MCU completionists. If you've seen the posters, you've basically seen the movie."

Hard to say; it had the same tone and feel as Ant&Wasp; continuing the humor-rationing from movie 1. The most prominent ""comedy bits"" were direct rip-offs of 3 different Rick&Morty episodes. But the biggest, personal, let down is that i was never once scared of Kang. Introducing the new BBEG, the exile, the worst of the Kang variants, & the most ""menacing"" he was shown was when he was punching Lang with his bare fists (which Marvel spoiled by including it in the trailer... love when they put scenes from the climax in a trailer... great marketing...)I WANT to like it; both because I want it to be better and I'm tired of defending Phase4 to Marvel haters who say they got lazy and aren't trying.

",nikhilsawant09,/user/ur155600835/,22 February 2023,"This is a decent movie, but it leaves something to be desired. The story feels incomplete and there are moments when it feels like there should be more to the plot. The action scenes are also lacking in excitement, and there are moments when it seems like the movie is holding back on delivering the full potential.However, the movie does provide a good start to Phase 5, and it does introduce some interesting new characters and concepts that may play a significant role in future Marvel movies. The performances by the actors are strong, and there are some moments of humor that are genuinely funny.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania falls short of its potential, but it is still an enjoyable watch for Marvel fans. It's worth seeing for the introduction of new elements to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it doesn't quite live up to the high expectations set by previous Marvel movies."
7," It was worth it but doesn't fill our excitement.
",Mysterygeneration,/user/ur104853183/,22 February 2023,"Even if it's on an incredibly small scale, something significant is happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The third installment of the Paul Rudd-starring series about a divorced father turned ex-con with a remarkable shrinking suit, Quantumania is also the first movie in Phase 5 of the MCU's overarching, 31 movies and 8 TV shows strong storyline. And it is important. Even if understanding the implications would necessitate a doctorate in molecular physics.Focusing on the pleasant San Francisco day makes it much simpler to imagine Scott and the rest of the lovely blended Lang-Pym-van-Dyne family enjoying their happy post-Blip life. That is, until they are drawn into the ""Quantum Realm"" of the subatomic realm by a teenager fiddling with a MacGuffin device. Why does that matter? One benefit is that Michelle Pfeiffer will get more screen time since she does a great job of putting all the crazy science fiction in emotional reality in her role as the original quantum investigator Janet van Dyne. She is just a working mother who feels guilty and believes that protecting her family by hiding her own previous traumas will help.The Quantum Realm is unquestionably worth visiting, with its microfauna forests and pulsating glowing creatures. Star Wars parallels that were sparked by the trailer are neither unfair nor off-putting, but this prolonged stay does rob us of some of the core Ant-Man movie pleasures: there are no recognisable, everyday objects to size up or down. Whatever strange but unexpectedly prevalent miniaturist kink ""smol"" sights appeal to is thus painfully unfulfilled.Also, there is no room for beloved side characters like Agent Woo, played by Randall Park, or Luis, Lang's former cellmate, with his heist-planning antics and famously drawn-out tales. Everything must make way for Jonathan Majors' eagerly awaited debut as Kang the Conqueror, Phase Five's new Big Bad.Which leads us to the crucial question that may affect your upcoming multiplex visits: Does Kang bang? He does, indeed. In The Force Awakens, Adam Driver was an emotionally charged it-boy, and Majors possesses that same energy. Observe how, even while he throttles his victims, his eyes frequently become wet with pity. The MCU moves forward relentlessly through ""phases"" and ""sagas,"" but what's the point if there's no opportunity to sit, think, and have a laugh with old friends? Kang would undoubtedly grasp this fundamental complaint about this effective movie product in his more melancholy moments."
5," Kang has destroyed trillions but.....
",nbtempest,/user/ur71517524/,22 February 2023,"He is easily defeated by Ant man and ants? This is a really poor set up for the next couple films.It is evident that Kevin Feige has nothing left to offer. I did go into this film with the understanding that it was an ant man film, so my expectations were low to begin with. Regardless, I was disappointed at every turn. I was rooting for Jonathan Majors Kang to sim just about the whole film after having to endure the acting from the main cast. There were several moments where I chuckled, but most of them came from Bill Murray, who was the 5 minute highlight of the film.Instead of the big Marvel into playing, all future films should now just play the music and have the words ""We're Sorry"" on the screen as it's clear that they aren't getting any better."
6," Lacks the magic of its predecessors
",dmansel,/user/ur123353548/,22 February 2023,"Everything is going great in Scott Lang's world. He's a successful author, he has his relationship with Hope van Dyne, and his bond with his daughter couldn't be stonger. All that changes when the three of them, along with Janet Van Dyne and Hank Pym, are transported to the Quantum Realm, taking them on an adventure that has them facing off against their most dangerous opponet yet.With Quantumania, Peyton Reed is the second MCU director to take a character through a full trilogy. With Ant-Man, Reed and his team crafted a simple heist film, a construct that worked famously within the confined of the shared universe. Ant-Man and The Wasp expanded the scope of Scott's world, giving viewers a Ferris Bueller-style adventure comedy focused on rescuing Janet van Dyne from the Quantum Realm. With Quantumania, the smaller, more character focused storytelling has largely been traded in for a wide ranging, consequence-heavy epic that feels out of step with its previous outings. Gone are the good natured antics and warmth of the X-Con gang, who fail to appear in the movie, replaced instead by an underdeveloped band of freedom fighters. The tone of the Ant-Man franchise, the foolish absurdity that Paul Rudd has made his bread and butter over the decades, quickly dissipates in the film's opening act, replaced by jokes that land at an inconsistent rate and cameos that ultimately amount to nothing.Written by Rick and Morty writer Jeff Loveness, the overall issue with Quantumania lies in the story. If the purpose of the story is to introduce Kang the Conqueror as the next overarching villain of the MCU, the ball was certainly fumbled here. While Kang is undeniably a threat, he doesn't feel like an Avengers-level threat during or after the events of this film. While the post credit scenes do a little to push the narrative, the movie itself fails at establishing Kang as a worthy menace, never fully revealing his overall goal outside of escaping the Quantum Realm. The Multiverse Saga was teased and set up throughout Phase 4, doing double duty as something of a dÃ©nouement of the Infinity Saga, but after the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home, Loki, and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, audiences were poised to delve fully into the multiverse and Kang's tyrannical reign upon it. Unfortunately, no such thing happens in Quantumania, continuing to leave audiences in the dark about what's coming or anyone's role in it (except Sylvie, her role was very clearly defined). It's this lack of clear definition that may leave some lukewarm on the run up to 2025's Kang Dynasty, a movie that Loveness is also the writer of.Starring Paul Rudd, Quantumania takes the time to explore the relationship between Scott Lang and his daughter Cassie. The overall theme and strongest throughline of the trilogy has been Scott's love for his daughter and this movie continues it; Rudd and Kathryn Newton have excellent chemistry together. Typically the happy-go-lucky Avenger, Rudd is able to expand a bit thanks the more dramatic elements of the film. These scenes Rudd, an actor proven that he can be just as good dramatically as he can comedically, handles with ease.The story's decision to fixate on Scott and Cassie's relationship comes at the detriment of almost every other character on screen, save Kang. Hank Pym, once again played beautifully by the seemingly perennially cantankerous Michael Douglas, has woefully little to do in this film, relegated to the background throughout the majority of the runtime. The same can be said for Evangeline Lilly as The Wasp, hanging back and serving little purpose other than to ask the questions the audience is already thinking. While the relationship between Lang and Hope van Dyne was fractured between the first two Ant-Man movies, time has managed to heal all wounds between the two here. Rudd and Lilly are always great together, with Lilly's no-nonsense nature counterbalancing Rudd's goofiness perfectly. With Quantumania, however, audiences don't get much interaction between the characters. Lilly is fine in the role, but sadly, is given little to do outside of one major scene.Michelle Pfiffer, bascially teased in the last minutes of Ant-Man and The Wasp, comes to forefront here in Quantumania as the audience's guide through the strange world. Pfiffer carries weight in the movie as Janet van Dyne navigates the heroes through the terrain while providing the necessary back story on Kang. Her agency in the movie cannot be denied, and while she takes a step back later in the film as Kang and Lang square off, she dominates the first half.Jonathan Majors is Kang. A complete 180 turnaround from the character he played in the last episode of Loki, this iteration of the character is as ruthless as he is cunning. Physically, Majors takes up space on the screen, and while he's roughly the same height as Rudd, it's Majors' presence that makes him seem larger than he is. The first of two antagonistic roles this year, Quantumania shows that while he's up to the task, the script and story don't rise to his skillset. Majors is fascinating on the screen; Kang the Conqueror doesn't fully reach the expectations levied upon him by producer Kevin Feige.The most disappointing element of the film is M. O. D. O. K. While impressive visually, and voice acted well enough by Ant-Man returnee Corey Stoll, the arc that began for Darren Cross in the first movie sees a limp and unsatisfying conclusion here. Sprinkled throughout the film generously, a lot of the jokes designed for or surrounding him fall flat in way that can't help but be reminiscent of Thor: Love and Thunder.Peyton Reed's ambition has to be admired. With some of the best visual effects since the MCU has entered the Multiverse Saga, Quantumania is a sight to behold. From the moment the characters enter the Quantum Realm, the background of almost any scene seems to be something pulled from Reed's fever dreams. While that doesn't always work in the film's favor (the actors rarely interact with the background, at times leaving a clear visual impression of two people standing in front of a screen), the praised must be heaped on the visual effects team. The trip to the Quantum Realm, the Mos Eisley cantina-esque scene, and the bevy of creatures found inhabiting the land have many comparing the movie to Star Wars, and rightfully so. It can't go overlooked that Reed unabashedly loves the Fantastic Four and actively worked on a film treatment long ago; there's scenes and ideas throughout that nod to his love of wacky space adventures. While the film's pacing is problematic, especially in its shaky first act, once Kang is finally introduced, the storytelling settles into its pace. Once established, the second act shines as the film's highlight, giving the story the feel of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, painting parts of the Quantum Realm as a desolate wasteland completely unlike what was shown near the end of Ant-Man and The Wasp. The third act, the weakest of the trilogy, enters absurd territory as Scott fights to stop Kang from enacting his nefarious scheme.Overall, Quantumania, while still entertaining at times, lacks the magic of its predecessors. The original spirit of the characters, the charm of Paul Rudd, and the low stakes of the Ant-Man franchise are absent, leaving viewers with a bleaker tone and a lack of goofy charisma they've come to expect. While Peyton Reed is still taking ambitious swings, a number of ideas don't fully connect, leaving the audience with a story that doesn't fully lives up to its potential. Rudd continues to be delightful, Jonathan Majors is appropriately menacing, and Kathryn Newton is a great addition, making the outcome of this project all the more baffling. Worth seeing on the biggest possible screen thanks to some of the great visual effects, Quantumania may have some viewers continuing to question the overall quality of the post-Endgame world we live in."
3," nope
",shronexdobson,/user/ur111355222/,22 February 2023,"This movie is a big let down if this is the start of phase 5. The story is lazy and stupid. Cassie lang is a bad character with bad lines, this lady was really hard to watch. Kang is a bad villain with no real power or appeal. Hard to be invested in anyone with crazy dumb jokes every 10 mins. Modok was a joke & it didn't land at all. If you really want to waste your time on another poorly written, soulless and forgettable MCU flick then I'd recommend biding your time until you can watch it on Disney. I can pretty much guarantee you won't regret not seeing it in theatres, I wish I hadn't bothered."
5," Poor addition to MCU
",cesaren,/user/ur13317542/,22 February 2023,"To sum it up:
GOOD: VFX, antagonist, funny moments
BAD: VFX, weak story, cringe momentsAnt-man movies were always different, an unexpected surprise, a good one. But this third installment was not good, despite some epic moments. Similar to previous MCU entries, the basic premise for the story wasn't compelling enough, and plain childish. Since there is a connection, Loki season 1 did a much better job at presenting/confirming the direction MCU is apparently going to.VFX was sometimes superb but also confusing or even poor quality (granted the nature of the Quantum Realm can be quite bizarre and confusing, but I'm talking about technical aspects).It had many funny and goofy moments, but the most cringe one was with MODOK, several times. It was unnecessary what the writers did with it. On the contrary, Kang was a very interesting antagonist.It's known these movies are part of something larger, but please writers: improve the writing so we can enjoy the next 2 Avengers movies."

",Nutterbutty,/user/ur148938602/,22 February 2023,"Ant-man and the Wasp Quantumania was super cool because it had modok and modok was really funny. The movie also showed modoks ass crack in a shot and it was the best scene in the movie tbh. The movie also had modok dying. Which is not good. Modok is a wonderful character with lots of potential and I believe they shouldnt have killed him. Go rectify your mistake and give every kang their own modok marvel. The main character actually do thing and modok was really cool as he was in the movie more than wasp. 6/10 because modok died and I didnt like that he died because i like modok and his baby ass, because it jiggled and stuff."
7," A Nice End to One of Marvel Universe's Fun Storylines
",inactivekick-76609,/user/ur148142280/,22 February 2023,"Marvel has given us tribute stories for some of their other fabled characters, so it seems only apt they sent the Ant-Man out with a pretty decent closure tale.Sending the main entourage of characters back to the Quantum Realm sets the ideal stage: as it also (finally) gives Ant-Man fans a far deeper look and exploration of the Quantum Realm, and much about its history, peoples (human or not), and secrets it may be harbouring for certain characters.On that basis alone, i think the director and story-line creators did an admirable job of finally cluing us up on the mysterious realm we had previously heard so much about but had nary a clue about. So mission accomplished, and done so rather nicely.Without the hitherto spoilers, it's notable to mention that the ""Super Boss Villain"" of this particular excursion into Quantum Land, kind of steals the show, as he excels as easily the best character portrayal in this entire movie. That said, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and other Earthlings do make fairly good plot fillers.All together this is everything we've come to expect from Marvel, and is nice end to the Ant-Man trilogy.A fun and exciting watch, for sure ;)"

Ant-Man and the Wasp find themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that pushes them beyond the limits of what they thought was possible.The third installment of the Ant-Man trilogy doesn't feel like an Ant-Man movie at all. Scott Lang was anything but the main character in the movie. I would've preferred if the Ant-Man was the main focus of the movie. Another problem I had with the movie was that it was all set in the quantam realm meaning that everything you see is CGI and fake. It looked cool at the first glance but as the movie progressed, it started to become more and more annoying. Just show me something real please! Additionally, the CGI and green screen weren't really that good. I could see Paul Rudd's outline in some scenes. Also, the acting of some of the cast was pretty bad especially with the very basic dialogue.Kang just stole the show. His backstory was very well written and his character had so much depth. His fight scenes with Ant-Man were so good and entertaining to watch. Jonathan Majors as Kang maybe one of the best villains in the MCU and I'm very glad he'll be sticking with us for a long while. The movie had it's funny bits but some jokes weren't really that funny.Score:6/10."
5," Overstuffs its Runtime, Losing the Charm of the First Two Films
",AxelAzzopardi,/user/ur49934204/,22 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania may have been visually impressive, but it failed to deliver the same level of charm and emotional depth as its predecessors. The movie felt overstuffed, trying to cram too many plotlines and characters into its runtime without allowing the audience to fully process what was happening.While the humor was still enjoyable, it often felt like a distraction from the convoluted plot. Paul Rudd's performance as Ant-Man was as endearing as ever, but it wasn't enough to salvage the film's lack of heart.One of the movie's highlights was Jonathan Majors' portrayal of Kang. His performance injected much-needed energy and personality into the film, leaving audiences excited for what's to come in the future of the MCU.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania had its moments, but it failed to capture the magic of the earlier Ant-Man films. Its lack of focus and emotional depth left you feeling unfulfilled, despite the impressive visuals and performances from the cast."

The only good thing about it is Johnathon Majors performance.Seriously, how do you entrust a major franchise with a writer (Loveless) whose mostly known for Kimmel bits, The Oscar's (??!) and Ricky and Morty (which has been in a downward spiral for years).

4," A Forgettable Entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
",zanesavage,/user/ur64918604/,22 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the latest entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, and Michael Douglas. The movie follows the adventures of Ant-Man, who teams up with the Wasp to explore the quantum realm and stop a new villain.The writing in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is lackluster, with a predictable and unengaging plot that fails to capture the imagination. The direction is uninspired, with lackluster action scenes that fail to create any real sense of excitement. The performances are mostly mediocre, with the exception of Michael Pena's Luis, who injects some much-needed humor and energy into the film.The cinematography is unremarkable, failing to create any memorable images or striking visuals. Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a forgettable entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that fails to live up to the standard set by previous films in the franchise.In summary, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a dull and forgettable film that fails to deliver on almost every level.

7," Definitely a wild ride
",jcfuller-00305,/user/ur162593024/,22 February 2023,"One of the most fun and weird movies I've seen in a while, which is mostly a compliment. I liked it! It was fun! I was pleasantly surprised by the sheer number of creatively new designs the quantum realm yielded, the probability storm scene in particular was one of my favorite MCU movie sequences of the past couple years. It really felt like a colorful comic book come to life. The blobby guy was a scene-stealer, though obviously he didn't reach the sheer comedic prowess of Luis, who was missed here. The Pym-Lang family were a great cast of characters to watch and even if the other 2 Ant-Man films may be the better two because of the tonal difference, it was still interesting to see them face a larger-scale threat, and the final battle of the civilians and the heroes versus Kang's army felt very tense and exciting....where has Jonathan Majors been the past decade?? This man can act like nobody's business. Kang was easily one of the best parts of the movie, his backstory with Janet was really intriguing and his unrelenting coldness in his methods was chilling, as was his massive displays of power. It'll be awesome to see him again down the road. MODOK was cool and funny, until his mask came off and I felt as though someone had poured sodium chloride into my eyeballs. Bill Murray was good but underused. I wished there was a little more time spent in San Fransisco (Jimmy Woo!) it felt like we had just barely re-established the characters before they were thrown into the quantum realm. Also, the second trailer for this movie made it seem as though Kang was going to tempt Scott with helping him regain time with Cassie that he lost over the blip, with dialogue that I'm pretty sure wasn't in the Final Cut discussing it (Kang even tells Janet at one point that he could send her back before she ever left her own family). I'm surprised they didn't go this route in the movie, instead having Kang's end of the bargain only being to not kill all of them. Overall though, the movie was really fun, weird, and visually pleasing, and a great time at the movies. The stakes felt higher than most MCU movies since we know Kang is going to be the next big villain and it felt like anything could happen with the timeline.Now, my opinion on the MCU movie prejudice that seems to be growing and growing: People keep dissing on these movies because they're not as 'refined' or something as other movies out there, but It's unfair to compare completely different genres with each other. People that want to say the MCU is too ""VFX heavy"" or ""Unserious"" need to realize that that's exactly what these types of movies are here to provide for audiences: a colorful, funny, adventurous story filled with superpowered heroes that fight evil. And audiences eat it up every time, it's clear that MCU movies are connecting with the general moviegoing public because every single release is a hit (some smaller than others, but still successful) and people keep coming back for more. Those who want to take shots at the aspects of MCU movies that are integral parts of MCU movies should just watch something else. I completely understand disliking these movies if one thinks they contain weaker superhero stories or weaker VFX or weaker comedy than usual, but one can't complain about it the existence of these different aspects in general when they're just pillars of what makes an MCU movie that people keep on coming back to for more. Sure, Quantumania wasn't a masterpiece by any means, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a perfectly satisfying and fun romp through a superhero-filled world, which is exactly what I expected from it. If I wanted a movie without these aspects, I wouldn't watch it. Hope that made sense, and here's to more fun MCU outings.*exhales* but anyways, cool film. OWEN WILSON!!!!!!!!!"
8," Great storyline; plot; body
",alpha-omega-p,/user/ur25559473/,22 February 2023,From a strong and involved comic reader; Quantumania is in my opinion really good; a solid plot; story and all around comic movie; none of the crap like in the last ThoR movie; if you enjoy Wakanda even though they changed some things it was good; and Quantumania is even better just a solid story Kang was a very good villain. It's at times intense; though well balanced and edgy.If you're a true fan of the comics from the early years you'll absolutely enjoy this film I already wanted to stay for another showing; I can't wait until it's released on Disney +It's definitely a movie to be watched more than once I'm sure I missed something lol. I truly can't wait to see Antman & The Wasp Quantumania again.
7," A Fun, Comic Book-y Adventure
",vinniec-53536,/user/ur87833656/,22 February 2023,"In Marvel Studios' 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', our favorite pint-sized (and occasionally giant-sized) hero Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and co. Are sucked into, and subsequently trapped in, the otherworldly Quantum Realm. There, Scott is forced to make a deal with the Devil, or in this case the dictatorial Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), the only one with the means to get them home. As the title suggests, the majority of the movie takes place in this subatomic universe, which doesn't look half-bad, considering it's basically a fully-CG environment. It is home to some unique creatures and residents, who have fairly minimal roles and are ultimately kinda forgettable, though the one named Veb was hilarious. The movie wastes no time getting the plot in motion, as we're off into the Quantum Realm within the first 10 minutes, and it's pretty well-paced overall. As far as the cast, everyone does a solid job. Paul Rudd is delightful as usual, and Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet van Dyne gets some time to shine in a larger role than expected. Newcomer Kathryn Newton portrays Scott's now-teenaged daughter Cassie, and while it was cool seeing her suit-up alongside her dad, she comes off as a bit unbelievable at times. However, it's Jonathan Majors' Kang who steals the show. He's menacing, intimidating, and has a calm-yet-confident demeanor. I've always loved characters who know how much of a threat they are, like Darth Vader, and Kang definitely fits into that category. I truly cannot wait to see more of him in future MCU projects. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention MODOK, the most perfectly goofy and ridiculous character I've ever had the pleasure of meeting in a movie. Overall, 'Quantumania' is much bigger in scale than the previous films in the 'Ant-Man' series, but still retains most of the humor and heart that they've become known for. In fact, I personally like it better than the last installment, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp'. It's a fun, extremely comic book-y (in a good way) family adventure through an intriguing sci-fi world, and I definitely had a good time watching."

It's a good introduction to Kang, Jonathan Majors did an excellent job and he really brought a menacing vibe to the whole film Paul Rudd was great as always, the whole cast was fantastic. I was surprised by the ending and thought that it felt a little rushed. One interesting part of the film was Modok who was funny but sometimes took away from the scenes he was in. The end credits scenes were pretty good, the first one had a good concept and what they were trying to introduce but it felt a little off. The second one was a great set up for another project coming up. So in all Ant Man and the Wasp Quantimania is a fun marvel superhero movie with a great cast and big ambitions that sometimes work and sometimes don't."

My six star rating being an indicator that it was not. Not that this movie was an absolute snoozefest but parts were boring and having all this alaborate build up for another big dumb Marvel CGI fight was very disappointing. I was hoping for greatness and was left underwhelmed. The Quantomverse was very cool to see and explore also Kang being the best part of the film, it was really interesting to learn more of his backstory and see him in a larger role, however Kang was not the only compelling character of the movie, he was the only one given focused attention to other than the heros we already know.

But still very entertaining and packed. Movie was clean and story was good. Plus it ties to the next phase of marvel movies. I assume low reviews are because people were comparing it to some great ones as the story could have been better and perhaps some might think it's a little random.

",scarsley,/user/ur86677613/,21 February 2023,"As the years go by, it's obvious that moviegoers are easily fooled in the thinking what is passing for quality.Kevin Fiege, who heads up Marvel has now become the grandmaster of smoke and mirrors. Lazy tropes, and emotionless storylines. Tired old stakes and storylines we have seen again, and again.Marvel appears doomed as it heads into phase 5, as we see the decline and probably the ending of superhero movies over the next 5 to 10 years.Paul Rudd has never exactly been a superhero type - and never exactly instilled anything but a bland ""Im here"" presence on the screen. And the fact that the movie he is in is more like a weekly sitcom than an exciting adventure of any kind. Never do you actually feel invested and never do you actually feel as if there is an issue at the heart of the movie.The decline continues."

Kang was hyped to be the best thing since thanos and in my opinion, iron monger from the first iron man had more character than the cardboard performance of Jonathan Majors. Hopefully he does better in the next few movies but i honestly blame the script. Wasp was barely in the movie, and Hank Pymm was comic relief most of the time. In the middle there was a cameo from an actor which was wasted as well and didn't amount to anything. The movie was more about janet van dyne than anything.

Antman & the Wasp Quantumania suffers from a problem that is recurring throughout the MCU films, and that is tying up the 3rd act in a satisfying end. This is usually in large part due to servicing the ongoing plot that is the MCU. However, there is a very noticeable decline in quality of narrative in the 3rd acts of most Phase 4 & 5 projects, despite the huge money thrown on screen. It all feels too manufactured, than created.The acting is all good, with Jonathan Majors absolutely crushing the role of Kang.

5," An unimaginative and familiar trip to the Quantum Realm
",hjvergara,/user/ur111907910/,21 February 2023,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is directed to a rather disappointing, unimaginative, and uncreative ""seen-it-all-before"" formula by Peyton Reed, who also helmed the first two installments in the Ant-Man series. It's not a terrible movie, and I'm sure many viewers will be entertained and wowed by the world building inside the Quantum Realm. But I was sadly underwhelmed as I was hoping for a different type of realm: one that is truly unique, different, out-of-this-world, and even hard to grasp and understand. Instead, I felt it was a rather dimly-lit, messy place that could still exist within the constructs of our understanding of physics and the world we inhabit. In other words, this didn't feel like a different dimension. It didn't feel otherworldly. And there are missed opportunities to build and make our visit to the Quantum Realm a weird, magical, and truly trippy awe-inspiring ride.To add to its detriments, this movie feels like a copy of ""Star Wars"" meets ""Strange World"". There are some attempts at trying to create cool, new alien creatures as semi-interesting, yet minuscule supporting characters. However, these are definitely not developed enough to establish a meaningful connection, nor are they inventive enough to really inspire wonder. There are scenes throughout that are startlingly similar to several of the ""Start Wars"" films, but I won't mention specifics to keep this as spoiler-free as possible.At the end of the day, I felt distant from the story. I did not care about the characters as much as I did in the first two installments, and the plot of a rebellion and a ruthless dictator-like villain also feels rehashed and very ""Star Wars"". The attempt to build some emotional resonance with the Scott Lang and Cassie Lang characters, via the father-daughter conflict, as well as the involvement of Hope Van Dyne as the Wasp, feels underveloped and underutilized - almost like they just put their familial conflicts on the back burner as the movie progressed.The movie eventually becomes what feels like a misplaced war movie against Kang the Conqueror. Jonathan Majors as Kang is one of the saving graces of this movie because his performance is commanding, intimidating, and full of personality. The scenes that stand out the most belong to him, as well as Michelle Pfeiffer, who is strong and captivating as Janet Van Dyne.As the first entry in the 5th age of Marvel, I was not impressed and rather bored. I hope the MCU strives to find ways to make better written stories that are more inventive and memorable. And let's amp up those special effects because they're getting sloppy. Also, let's bring back Michael Pena's funny and spunky Luis character, who is sorely missed."
4," Underwhelming
",belikerev-532-859651,/user/ur37847744/,21 February 2023,"This movie left me feeling underwhelmed and disappointed.One of the biggest issues I had with the film was its heavy reliance on CGI. While the special effects were impressive, they felt overused and at times, even distracting. The story also lacked the depth and originality that I was hoping for, and the characters didn't seem to have much growth or development.Overall, the movie may be enjoyable for some viewers, I personally found it to be a lackluster addition to the franchise. The reliance on CGI and lack of originality in the story made it feel like a cookie-cutter superhero movie that didn't stand out from the rest."
6," Oddly Written Story
",xianslad,/user/ur136096497/,21 February 2023,"Peyton Reed's film is a Marvel film written by Jeff Loveness and Jack Kirby. This film is an action/adventure/comedy that entertains the viewer while also expressing emotions for them to feel and comprehend. The plot follows Ant-Man, his family, and his workers as they become trapped in Quantumania and attempt to escape, only to run into Kang The Conquer. This film provided a massive opportunity for the characters to redeem themselves as they are today, but it failed to do so. The film was predictable and unimpressive. It was building to a peak, leading to another disappointing, predictable ending. Although there were some positive aspects, such as the VFX and editing, it was not a perfect film. In Quantum Realm, the setting is both unsettling and exciting. Paul Rudd does an excellent job as Ant-Man. He expresses his love for Cassie as he is compelled to complete a mission to restore time to spend more time with her but is misled by deception. His performance adds a lot to the film and elevates it. If you are a Marvel fan, you should see this film since it continues the storyline that began with Kang The Conquer. There are two end credits; both are important, so take advantage of them."
9," Fantastic!
",trojandem-exe,/user/ur28748132/,21 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania(2023) is a 2023 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the characters Scott Lang / Ant-Man and Hope Pym / Wasp. It is a fantastic addition to the Ant-Man franchise, as it delivers a perfect blend of action, comedy, drama, and sci-fi that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the film.The exploration of the Quantum Realm, where they interact with strange creatures and embark on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they thought was possible, was truly remarkable.The introduction of Khang's character, who is an Avengers-level threat and a time-traveling conqueror with multiple variants, was also impressive. He added a new layer of complexity and challenge to Ant-Man's story. The acting performances by Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Jonathan Majors were outstanding. They brought their characters to life with charisma, humor, emotion, and chemistry.Overall, I believe this is the best Ant-Man movie to date, and I am confident that anyone who watches it will thoroughly enjoy it as much as I did."
6," It was alright
",joliek-26863,/user/ur162579911/,21 February 2023,"This third Ant-Man movie is in an odd situation. There's so many characters that it actually makes it harder for me to connect with them, especially since there's really no time to get to know them and build their personal journeys. I'm assuming that was mainly due to the fact that they had been in other movies already but those never got too in-depth either plus it had been a while since the last film So in the end it was more of a special effects extravaganza that I didn't end up spending to much time caring about. The pacing was pretty good though and I was still entertained by those set pieces so I would recommend an watch if you're just looking for mindless entertainment to pass time."
4," It all becomes a blur after a while.......
",FlashCallahan,/user/ur22668817/,21 February 2023,".........and that literally is a line from the film, summing up how the MCU has become since Covid hit the world. Disney are now jumping the shark 31 films into the universe......Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and The Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet and Hank Pym, and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang, the family finds themselves exploring the pretty redundant Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new CGI creatures, and monstrosities, and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of boredom, and what they thought possible.I love Ant-Man. The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.And 6, and 7.This will go on forever.......Help us."
3," Not Worth Your Time
",joeysleister-29933,/user/ur147212061/,21 February 2023,"The only reason I didn't score this any lower is because Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer carried this entire movie. If they weren't in the movie then it would just be bad instead of borderline bad.It's almost like Peyton Reed saw all the worst parts of Iron Man 2 and decided to make a feature length film out of them.Also I'm a film called ANT-man I didn't expect there to only be three scenes with ants and for Scott to only shrink down three times in this movie. I'm honestly very disappointed after watching this, it felt like a waste of time and I could have been doing something else. It wasn't the worst MCU movie but it's still not a good one."
8," It's a good time
",jenakay,/user/ur64663384/,21 February 2023,"I don't care what reviews say ""Quantumania"" was great. Funny, unique, action packed and filled with MCU call backs for real fans. I was SOOOOO disappointed with ""Multiverse of maddness"" and people loved that trash ""Thor love and thunder"" was a good movie that was forced to shoe horn in humor that derailed it and rushed the storyline. This movie (though the CG is EXTREME) was so cool and unique and a great way to kick of phase 5. If you watched and like the LOKI series you'll be very excited. Paul rudd is always amazing and Jonathan Majors kills it. Just think of this as a starwars otherworld story not grounded in our own and you can have fun, don't go in wanting to take it too seriously and it's a blast and feast for the eyes. Also the side characters are hilarious, on par with Ragnarok.Definitely didn't feel like a trilogy ending film though more like an opening to the coming ones so that was unexpected. I'd see it again 100% if you like Paul rudd, LOKI, or any of the antman franchise so far- hell even just to see Bill Murray make his MCU debut- see it on the big screen(3D not necessary but would add depth) its made for a big screen for sure."
6," Tthe most entertaining Star Wars movie I've seen in a while
",crayne-640-519057,/user/ur42029801/,21 February 2023,"So, saw Antman and the Wasp - Quantumania yesterday. It's like Marvel kept whining to Lucasfilm that they wanted to do a Star Wars movie, but George kept saying no.""Fine! We'll make our own generic story about outsiders joining rebels against a dark empire and overthrowing its evil leader! With blackjack and hookers!!!""The core narrative is tired, most supporting characters never reach their potential, and the performances are underwhelming, although Jonathan Major's Kang manages to convey a certain pain at being who he has to be. Easily the stand-out actor in this movie. Also, I always thought MODOK was ridiculous. Turns out I'm still right."
7," Reminds me of a Spy kids movie
",jfrancosa,/user/ur78891947/,21 February 2023,"I love Marvel movies, but there's something about this one that made me feel that I was watching Spy Kids film. Some bad CGI for Marvel. What's up with that?ðŸš¨Spoiler alert ðŸš¨M. O. D. O. K's CGI is the saddest of them all. A big headed monstrosity that looks like Pac Man. Also, his back story, I don't know, I don't like when writers change a character's back story.Overall, the movie is fun to watch, and if you like the MCU you will enjoy it. Probably not the best MCU Movie, but there are worse. Paul Rudd makes all the Antman movies worth it. Same here. He's a funny guy.Now, the movie plot could've been better."
7," Fun with an amazing Kang debut.
",lschouder-04582,/user/ur69257062/,21 February 2023,"I really miss the serious and grounded tone of films like Captain America: the Winter Soldier. Lately, Marvel films have been very Disney-fied. Having said that, this film was silly but still pretty good. Johnathan Majors has some really nuanced and powerful acting moments that anchor the movie. Kang is a fantastic villain that was perfectly executed. I was also surprised to find myself feeling sympathy towards MODOK. Who would've ever thought that character would translate well to film, but they pulled it off pretty decently.I also think some of the humor helped as well. I think this film should've ended differently, but all-in-all it wasn't a bad movie. However, going forward I really hope Marvel can get back to being more serious and regain the gravitas that made the Infinity saga so great."
3," On & on & on & on & on...
",W011y4m5,/user/ur71088443/,21 February 2023,"In the same way that ""X Men: Apocalypse"" was a thoroughly underwhelming viewing experience after the events of ""Days of Future Past"" (& a signal of the 20th Century Fox Universe's impending collapse), sitting through ""Quantumania"" at the cinema feels very reminiscent of that fateful feature; a total slog, arguably akin to watching a corporate, money hungry studio thrust the lifeless corpse of a dead franchise (which died of natural causes in 2019) in front of paying audiences; held up loosely at the limbs by strings, hoping that the visible movement in the ligaments will perhaps convince viewers that this decomposing husk is arguably still alive & therefore, they should continue to attend future screenings (& grace Disney with their hard earned cash) - under the pretence the heart's seemingly beating.Dear reader, it is not.If the third ""Antman"" proves anything beyond reasonable doubt (accounting for the fact that the movie spends the majority of its run-time, endeavouring to justify its existence without providing an actual explanation), it's that the story irrevocably concluded with (the aptly titled) ""Avengers: Endgame"" & anyone still entertaining the possibility of revivication will be brutally disabused of that fantasy by the time the credits start rolling.I say this because one of the most essential things a writer can do (to ensure a high quality of work when crafting even the most basic of story) is know when to stop (before their tales out-stay their welcome) - to guarantee that our investments of time are worthwhile - & here marks the point where I truly believe the MCU crosses that unavoidable threshold & ventures perilously close to undoing all that's been done, previously - in an undignified attempt to remain relevant. Of course, the boundaries for such a parameter are subjective (& our idea of what constitutes a ""dragged-out"" denouement differs) so others are entitled to an opposing viewpoint but in my opinion, when a continuation necessitates the negation of a prior plot thread's emotional stakes to justify further installments, that's typically an indicator of when you've gone too far (because you're doing genuine damage to what came before & informing the audience that the purpose of the progression isn't to develop & grow for any discernible reason - whilst maintaining the importance of the past - but to needlessly expand for the sheer sake of it, at any cost, providing them with a reason to no longer engage) & resultantly, that's when no further sequels should be granted (as it's clearly over)... However, in order to establish ""Kang the Conqueror"" as a new credible threat, the saga subsequently falls in to that fatal trap (acting as an embarrassing statement of intent - ""I'm not going anywhere"" - really, loitering like an attendee at a house party who doesn't seem to realise it's over) & trivialises the risks posed beforehand. Consequently, Peyton Reed & his scribe Jeff Loveness (in the space of a mere 2 hours) render over a decade's worth of carefully planned, built-up world-building as meaningless - to inorganically shift the emphasis on to *this* antagonist (whose jarringly immediate introduction gives the impression as though an ""Avengers"" level threat was required quickly to maintain fan attention & having already dealt with Thanos - an iconic villain whose foreboding presence was felt for years before naturally emerging - executives alternatively approached them to desperately pitch the insertion of ""bad guy 2"" within the space of 1 blockbuster) who - at this rate - will (additionally) likely be equally inconsequential within a few years... So what's the point? The only honest response is ""profit"" & ""capitalist greed"". That's what this is; more of the same, repackaged unadventurously, yet brazen in its increasingly superficial motivations.The palpable aura of irrelevance is exacerbated further by the sci-fi concept featured; despite the consistent lack of originality in their product, Marvel's outings used to at least have relative structure / coherence & follow a linear format. Now tackling the multi-verse (with endless possibilities, variations of the same characters existing simultaneously in endless realities & universes housed within each other), since literally ANYTHING is possible (rules be damned), the insignificance of what we're watching feels more noticeable than ever considering that feeling (of futility) is ironically shared by the people we see on screen (no longer adhering to any sense of logic). Furthermore, if one universe is destroyed, an infinity of others are not... Again, Jonathan Major's ""Kang"" (who has apparently culled numerous timelines) embodies a hollow risk that's insisted to be monumental - yet we know it's ironically infinitesimal, due the brazen replaceability of everything. As mentioned, that culminates as a tired reaffirmation of the triviality of what we're witnessing (irrespective of its visual spectacle) so rather than carving out a clear, distinct direction... People will leave theatres, reminded how it doesn't have one anymore - yet stuff repeatedly happens, in spite of that - through obligation, not requirement.I haven't even mentioned the humiliatingly shoddy VFX (so soon after James Cameron's ""Avatar"", which is a masterpiece by comparison), awfully expository dialogue, juvenile humour (so many jokes about holes / bodily functions) & convoluted nature of the messy, contrived script. Plus, the half-baked, two-dimensional characterisations, unconvincing line deliveries & surprisingly uninventive cinematography (from Bill Pope, responsible for ""The Matrix"" trilogy). None of it works. None of it will end by its own volition. You'll have to prize that sore, milked udder from their dry, mummified hands. They're squeezing out every last drop & we'll be forced to endure each & every torturous moment until someone finally puts this out of its misery."
6," Atleast you won't be disappointed...
",anuraaggupta-90835,/user/ur160876733/,21 February 2023,"Antman and the Wasp: Quantumania opens the possibilities for the future of the Marvel Cinematic universe ala Star Wars style.It is the weirdest mcu film yet, borrowing elements from a Star Wars playbook. It simulates the tussle between the rebellion and the empire ruled by Kang. There were a lot of alien terrain and new civilizations introduced. The quantum realm was wonderfully visualized though I hoped we got to immerse more in those environments.As for our heroes, character development was stagnant for most part. It missed the opportunity to delve deeper into the father-daughter dynamics of Scott and Cassie after disappearing for 5 years due to the blip. It would have been nice to witness the serious side of Antman aside from his comedic chops.If there is one commendable portrayal, it would be that of Jonathan Majors as Kang the conqueror. His every appearance is truly menacing. Though the casualties he caused seem a little cartoonish to be taken seriously, he exudes great gravitas, worthy to be the next big villain of MCU.The third installment of Ant-man may seem ridiculous at times but it is ridiculously fun as well. I enjoyed the film all throughout."
8," A good Movie, somewhere in the middle of Marvel Movies
",adamlennard,/user/ur83302920/,21 February 2023,"I really did enjoy this film, mainly due to some very good acting and a fun story and a pretty good villain. In terms of the MCU this will probably rank somewhere in the middle which shows just how good the MCU can be. Paul Rudd is perfect as Antman as usual but I personally really enjoyed Michael Douglas performance. Will it win any awards? Probably not, did it keep me entertained? Absolutely and at the end of the day I'm a firm believer movies are about having fun and enjoying yourself and this quite simply is a lot of fun. As mentioned before one big strength is the films villain one area the MCU struggles is it's bad guys and I'm pleased to say Kang is one of the better ones with an interesting motive the fact Antman himself questions if defeating Kang was the right things is an unique wrinkle."
6," My fault for expecting more?
",AfricanBro,/user/ur120413622/,21 February 2023,"So much happened before so unless you just binged every mcu movie before this, I suggest watching a recap video. The one by screencrush was the best one I found. This is unfortunately a pivotal movie in the mcu, so despite everything I'm going to say you still have to watch this.The one thing I loved and think they did splendidly was the story. I think it was great and the most redeeming thing about the movie, there weren't any mind blowing twists but it kept me interested throughout, didn't feel like lazy writing.Kang delivered, character wise, but I feel like apart from the visions from the future he was underwhelming. He's supposedly a multiversal threat, killed so many avengers in different timelines, the big bad conqueror... and he's outdone by antman?(and not through wits, that'd been more believable). It took time to actually see his power because when the fighting starts he seems to be cautious and sorta aghast he's going to lose. Maybe I don't rate antman highly enough, but I feel like Kang should've easily whooped his butt and maybe even killed the entire 'ant squad'.However out of all the characters, Kang's the one that carried the whole movie; Jonathan Majors did his character justice but unfortunately the writers did not. Majors delivered on top his performance in Loki which had made excited to see him again.Dialogue wasn't great, it was pretty dull and the acting was subpar, like they were shooting a Disney channel kids show at times like Cassie's continuously smiling throughout for instance. It didn't try to push for humor as much as other marvel products but the few jokes it had didn't land.Could've paced just a little quicker to make everything feel more urgent and imminent. It was inconsistent, at times I liked it, at times I was trying not to zone out.Story was amazing but the movie was missing that wow factor to make it feel special. I think Kang was arguably it but felt like he only lost so that the Kang variants come through. For the sake of keeping the story going. Also the other Kang variants were all African, thought that was funny.Modok felt like he was written to be the butt of the joke for the movie, felt very underutilized, he was sorta hyped up as this killing machine but didn't deliver. Isn't he supposed to be to Kang what steppenwolf is to darkseid. Plus he looked so silly, I mean it's hard not to make a floating head with tiny arms look silly, but they probably could've made him a lot more ghoulish to offset that.The chemistry between the characters wasn't there, as I said at the beginning, so much has happened before this movie in the mcu, so in that time antman has lost over 10yrs of seeing his daughter growing up already, before the movie even starts. The bond between all the characters wasn't there for any of the characters and it wasn't allowed to develop.Quantum realm itself was what disappointed me the most, I knew I was expecting too much so I lowered my expectations but still somehow got disappointed. I recently watched ""Strange World"" and this was very reminiscent of that, a children's animation.It's not intolerable watch though it's just incredibly underwhelming for what it could've been. You still have to watch it as it's important for the multiverse going forward; but you could just wait until it's released for streaming instead of going to the cinemas if you're contemplating."
9," Going against the tide
",Kyuss077,/user/ur44136179/,21 February 2023,"I saw this on Friday night with my sons. It's a family tradition to see each marvel movie at the cinema the week it comes out. We all really liked it. I don't know why everyone is complaining so much about it. Was it as good as infinity war, no. But it was still a great movie. I am in my late forties and I read comics as a kid in the 80s. I think they did a great job with the characters costumes and the overall design and story. Perhaps the bomb reviews are just a case of some people hating on things when they get really popular. A bit of the old "" I loved Marvel before they sold out"" Spend the $10, see it at the movies and make up your own mind."
6," A fun, pointless ride.
",darrian-zellman-913-210017,/user/ur50371770/,21 February 2023,"A fun ride with great visuals that unfortunately exists only to tell us the one thing we already know: Kang is coming. It will be great to see him in the next films where he's not treated as a one-off character. But again, the visuals are incredible. If you get the chance I highly recommend watching this movie in a ScreenX theatre.If you're a fan of M. O. D. O. K., I think you will definitely be disappointed in the way he's portrayed. I had successfully avoided all trailers so I was pleasantly surprised to see him in the movie, until he revealed himself. Holy crap what a silly character.All in all, it was a fun ride but I definitely won't watch it again. It's pointless. Kang is coming, that's all you need to know.Note: If you haven't watched the Loki series, it might be difficult to follow this next phase of marvel. Check it out!"
7," Beautiful movie, bad ending
",monobunny-49149,/user/ur162492545/,21 February 2023,"I loved the CGI in this movie. The shots were amazing and the characters there uniquie, as always. Paul's character was so endearing and as always I could root for him, but Janet was so frustrating. She kept so much away from the others and I thought she did something bad willingly. I also did not like the ending though. I thought Scott and Hope would need to find a way to get out of the Quantum Realm after defeating Kang, but their problem was quickly resolved. Also Kang was only defeated by being stepped on by a few ants? Really? I cannot wait to see his character more though, it is really intriguing."

It was funny and had great action.. i think superhero movie ratings are starting to get the unnecessary super snobs... if you haven't seen this movie, I recommend you do. I hate that the bar is set so low but maybe you should go see it with low expectations. Just go have fun and enjoy a well put together film. You will enjoy it.Jonathan Majors is the perfect fit for Kang. You will love him as a villain. I can't wait to see how this character evolves.Paul Rudd is always awesome and funny.

5," An unpretentious movie.
",jp_91,/user/ur21881328/,21 February 2023,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is another generic Marvel movie, managing to fail in many respects: the director's work is flat, the soundtrack is totally forgettable, the costume design is very simple, the design of the creatures is not visually captivating, the cinematography is bad and the special effects sometimes look decent but in other scenes they're pretty fake. The script had potential but it could not be exploited, it only entertained on some occasions. The best were the participations of Paul Rudd, Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas who achieve interesting characters. A movie that entertains without any other pretension."
10," Not the Mess People have said it would be. :::LOKI Spoilers:::
",darenlouison,/user/ur162563137/,21 February 2023,"I would have to agree with most, that the direction marvel has taken with most of its new content (Post endgame) has been like watching an icecream van trying to put in its best lap time, on the Nurbergring.But Quantumania does not fall into that catagory.Were you a fan of Loki?Did you understand what sylvie did when she chose to kill the one who remains?Do you understand the gravity of who Kang is, and what he represents to all time, and how scary that really is?If you answered yes to any of the above questions, then quantumania is what you have been waiting for. It cuts out the fluff... (of ""hey, how is that sword able to kill gods?"" and ""why did that bad guy kidnap those children anyway, didn't he loose a child?"" Oh! And isn't the hulk baby mama from a different universe? And why is this first we're hearing of his son?!"") ...and gets straight to the scray reality of why kang is sooo much worse than Thanos.I would almost recommend that if you have only watched loki AND NOTHING ELSE after that!! (From the MCU)
This is where the story picks up. ONLY what this movie!Worth the watch? Yes.Worth the wait? Barely.What Marvel has done lately, can only be compared to going to an amazing wedding, eating the best food at the reception and the last things you're waiting for is for the cake to be cut, but you're then forced to endure speeches from the wait staff who constantly go on about their personal beliefs in weddings and while this one is nice weddings are pointless.The only saving grace is that the wedding cake is a tripple baked, tripple chocolate cheesecake, with a shortbread crust that melts in your mouth, and while amazing, BARELY excuses the drivel you had to endure to get to this point. But it's so good that while you leave the wedding slightly traumatised but so satisfied you forget what you were going to complain about on customer experience form."
8," Change my Mind
",timeblank,/user/ur85931294/,21 February 2023,"Some good points, Seeing the quantum world was amazing, secondly introducing Kang the Conqueror was great. He was intimidating and persuasive. But I do have concerns, Oh my goodness, what happened to MODOK! Wow they made him painfully goofy. The injustice with Kang and his war. It was painfully disappointing on how it concluded.I was thrill to see the Kang Dynasty post credit scene. However, I see Star Wars. It was great. But Ant man was supposed to die. I was disappointed that he didn't. Oh well, I am rooting for Kang because he is the best villain ever! Luis was missed and he was supposed to be the movie. Where is he?"
2," Most Disappointed With Marvel Ive Been
",ThereelscoopwithKK,/user/ur153803309/,21 February 2023,"From someone who enjoyed Thor Love and Thunder while others detested it this movie took it to a whole new level of awful for me. I enjoyed the first 2 Ant Man movies. There was something comforting to the humble Paul Rudd playing Ant man. The characters all fit in perfectly with a simple story. Nothing spectacular, but simple , comedic, and worthwhile.This one on the other hand totally sacrificed Ant Man's character to serve as exposition and did a poor job with that. The characters themselves all felt like different people. Hank Pym feels uninspired , Hope goes along for the ride, and Ant Man is the opposite of his old humble persona which I loved before. His character served as some relief in the past for the other bombastic Marvel personalities. The casting of Cassie doesn't quite fit well with me either.This movie felt like a combination of the worst parts of Spy Kids 3D, Star Wars , and Sharkboy and Lava girl. There was a lot of opportunity to do much more with the quantum realm and this just felt like no effort was put into it. The sets themselves look like they were made in an early 2000s movie. At one point someone in the theaters chair broke and instead of laughing at the movie the audience got amusement out of that.For all the build up nothing ever quite adds up in the story. The one saving grace is that Jonathan Majors is a high quality actor. Even with his skill set they still nearly ruined him with a full and uninspiring script. I came into this so excited after how they concluded Loki season 1, but what a let down.They are going to need another stellar Loki season to try to get this phase back on track. I hope they don't spoil Guardians for me as well with their final send off not long from now."
2," Poorly-made movie with zero heart
",brohouser-514-326979,/user/ur37354242/,21 February 2023,"The writing was lazy and surface-level, and the plot was very basic. You just don't ""buy"" much of the tension or plot development in this one. Side characters and plots are shallow & forgettable. I completely forgot Bill Murray had been in this movie until I remembered a couple days after I had seen it. Cassie is ""introduced"" much too quickly, and the bulk of the main plot kicks off far too abruptly to let you settle into the Marvel universe or get to know the ""new"" characters.The clunky dialogue in the script gave the actors no room to shine, and no performance stood out to me. Straight-up overdramatic Steven Segal level, ""yeah, I came back for you. So let's do this."" ""I don't have to win, we just both have to lose"" type of stuff throughout, with few actual conversations. Almost every line is a throwaway. The few serious/emotional conversations in the film felt shallow, especially since so little depth was shown in the characters or their dialogue throughout. One particular new character was overacting dramatically, and that combined with the shoddy dialogue made some of my theater groan any time she showed up.The entire movie is CGI (totally fine based on the story they're telling) but most of it looks noticeably bad compared to past films, let alone on its own. It's never been so apparent how overworked & underpaid marvel's effects department is. Feels very ""Spy Kids."" There were lots of ""cute"" CGI creatures, robots, and animals, but they felt shallow as well. They didn't seem creatively made or thought out, and the background environments got boring after a while, like it was just the same looped Windows screensaver over and over.I've been on board with Marvel since Iron Man and I admit they've pumped out a few clunkers over the past 5 years, but this one really took the wind out of my MCU sails. They've never put out something as soulless and void of heart & thought as this.I thought it was cool when Kang demonstrated his powers toward the end, even if he did randomly stop in order to accommodate the protagonists' plot armor. Jonathan Majors gives a physically & visually intimidating performance as Kang. The opening of the movie was funny. There was one new character introduced that I enjoyed for the most part. The very last fight was intense and I genuinely didn't know who was going to win."
1," Not good
",malcolmmckay-19016,/user/ur162560654/,21 February 2023,This movie is the most depressing thing I have seen in the theaters. No comedy very suicidal vibes. If you need to watch a new movie go back to the two original.There is a lot of missing notes from this film there is little to no carry over from previous films and the title should have been without antman and wasp. The comedy and fun from previous movies was defiantly missing.Went with a family who enjoyed all marvel movies and they left feeling witty the same feelings as me. I feel that the direction of the mcu is heading in a direction that will destroy the franchise even more. Don't subject your friends and family to this depressing and more over waste of time.
9," I enjoyed it
",Mike-59746,/user/ur162559890/,21 February 2023,"It was enjoyable, with a degree of complexity and humor. I will admit that there were times that I wish I could pause it to try and catch up with the quantum theory that they were applying in the scene. It has some good thoughts through it. The cg was to be expected in a ""QUANTUM REALM""! But then again, perhaps there are people out there that visit that realm daily, that could have made a real set based on the real thing. Who knows these days. The movie was good. There were some rushed, or scattered parts, but what movie doesn't have something that someone is going to cry out-""I would have done it differently"". Worth the trip for me."
5," Ok movie
",kemal-44877,/user/ur74178644/,21 February 2023,"Not as bad as most movies from phase 4. It didn't feel too special. They tried too hard to hide Kang for some reason, it's not like he's the best kept secret for this movie. There are 6 consecutive scenes where characters ask other characters the question who and asked ones don't reply. Actors did a good job, visual effects were good. I watched it with Dbox experience and it definitely add to the enjoyment. I'd suggest everyone to go watch this movie in a movie theatre with 3D or at least Dbox otherwise can get a bit boring. I was expecting Kang to be a bit more intimidating since they claimed Kang is the new Thanos. But nope, still nothing beats Thanos :)"
6," The Fall of an Empire?
",jskitsandstuff,/user/ur125339968/,21 February 2023,"Marvel has seemingly abandoned so much of what once made their movies special. While Majors crushes it as Kang, he is subsequently devalued by the end of the film. Why are there so many super geniuses? Why are they forcing a Young Avengers movie so hard? Nobody asked for it! Nobody needs it!This would've been better with more Scott Lang vs Kang and less secondary characters that nobody cares about (the warriors we meet in the quantum realm take up too much screen time).The big battle at the end feels far overblown, and it could've been done better if a smaller scale was used. Marvel will not be able to keep churning out these big budget films forever if they continue to turn away from what made them successful in the first place."
6," Do we Lang for more?!
",Stanlee107,/user/ur17087537/,21 February 2023,"This is another fun marvel film. However, many critics may argue that the golden era/phrase of marvel films is behind us. It is still very watchable but I wouldn't suggest it is as average as most DC adaptation films except for maybe the Joker & the Batman that are cream of the crop.Back to the film, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is enjoyable being the lovable underdog avenger character that lives on reminiscing about his glory days. The rest of the team members have a nice believable character dynamics. The surprise cameo was just fantastic & he may have stolen the best scenes from this film. The storyline is fine & special effects are decent but not spectacular.The trailers made the common Hollywood mistake of showing too much & spoiling one key end scene towards the end... Any potential viewers shouldn't be too disappointed by this film."
8," Really funny!
",nicholasvalenzuela,/user/ur157573696/,21 February 2023,"I went to watch this movie during discount Tuesday, with my mom and little sister. During the movie nothing really happened between us barely any talking/jokes. Throughout the movie I found my self laughing pretty hard, it was a really funny movie, and such an upgrade from the last one. The plot of the movie could've been a little more and there could've visualized a little more at steak but that's just a suggestion (doesn't need to be fixed or anything) The visuals were amazing, and I really enjoyed the editing style. Everyone else rated the movie 8-8.5 they thought it was hilarious but a little stupid at times."
6," An ok MCU movie, like (almost) everything post Endgame
",zoomzoom-1,/user/ur3468275/,21 February 2023,"The first two Ant-Man movies were light on CGI and action, but strong on character driven story, which what made them so likable. This one goes the opposite way: the Quantum realm is now a galaxy, far far away (yes, everything is star wars like over there), and Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly's roles is reduced to one liners. Paul Rudd is still, mostly, the heart of the movie, but the actress that portrays his daughter lacks any charisma, and her path from a little girl into the next super-hero is a bit unclear.Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors are the only interesting characters in the movie, although I'm still not sure what are Kang's motives.It's not a terrible movie, and a two hours run time makes the chaos easier to digest, but at the end, pretty forgettable."
7," Actually I'd give it a 7 1/2.
",strizbiz-99429,/user/ur69599468/,21 February 2023,"Ok, I know everyone has their own opinion, but if you take yourself too seriously, you're not going to enjoy it. If you liked the other Antman movies you might like this. Visually it's amazing, lots of eye candy. If you've read Marvel comics growing up you'll appreciate it more so than people who've never picked up a comic, I'd don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave it at that. I enjoyed it for what it was and it definitely had a couple of cool surprises. If you're looking for a serious Oscar nomination worthy movie, go watch something else, this movie was fun and imo did it's job as an Antman movie. It had humor, action and cool cgi. Would I give it a 10? No, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it."
6," Boring.
",dandfish,/user/ur72957529/,21 February 2023,"Thor 2 and 4 were bad but not boring. This was boring. Took forever for the action to happen. Having Ant-Man go toe to toe with Kang kinda undersells him as the next Thanos level threat.Ant-Man is the little guy with the small scale stories and they introduce the new Thanos with him?The quantum realm was lame in the sense this could have happened in space. Nothing about the movie that needed the quantum realm specifically. It needed new rules or something.I hate when world's set up rules and then break them. Scott was in the quantum realm for 5 years during the blip, but only felt like 5 mins. Janet aged 30 years and acted like she lived there 30 years, not 30 minutes. Keep the rules straight."
8," I love this movie
",jdstwhvcz,/user/ur162541624/,20 February 2023,"I felt so regret that I didn't go IMAX theatre. The world of quantumania is so beautiful. This is a great journey to explore the quantumania. I was so surprise that some comments said that Scott became less important. The entire story was just about Kang. For me, I found the bonding between Scott and Cassie impressed me a lot. This story is not just about Kang. This is a good introduction to let the audience knows about the villain and multi-universe in Phase five. This movie is much better than Dr. Strange. At least Ant-Man' trailer is match with my expectations. I look forward to see Kang in the other movie and episodes."
5," Well this party died!
",ppxdndg,/user/ur132338757/,20 February 2023,"This whole thing felt like a 2h 30m episode of Rick and Morty written by Justin Roiland.I'm saying that because it actually is from a writer from Rick and Morty. Because (I think to cut costs) Marvel decides every single thing they make now has to revolve around Rick and Morty writers.Every single time they even attempt to make a joke it always ALWAYS lands flat. Maybe some slight bits quirky are sometimes cute but for almost everything I watched with a dead face.However...The only reason why I can say this has any value is M-effing Kang The Conqueror. THIS is a Marvel villain. Literally almost every scene he is apart of is even remotely Good. He's so much a threatening character to be a really good replacement to Thanos and Jonathan Majors makes this performance his own. His acting is almost TOO good for Ant-man and the Wasp: Quantumania.But unfortunately, there is a Yang to this Yin. And you pretty much know what it is - It's MODOK.I have never seen something butcher a really good villain so bad it becomes laughably awful even when he's not telling a joke, but here we are. And that Terrible CGI head isn't doing any favors either.Did they took inspiration from the Patton Oswald MODOK show? Because I swear MCU MODOK and stop motion MODOK are practically the same thing.However, despite MODOK's head the visual facts are really good especially for a Marvel movie.My Advice is for you to wait till it's on Disney+ if you just want to educate yourself before the next two avengers movies."
8," a film that works well, exactly what the MCU needed!
",raulvg-31151,/user/ur80990822/,20 February 2023,"The film is funny and with good performances (with the exception of the bad performance of Kathryn Newton) Paul Rudd remains incredible and has the best performance in the film, a perfect actor for Scott Lang and in this film, he proves it again.For fans of the films, I believe that the criticism is exaggerating, of course I understand about the negative / positive points that critics point out but it is certainly better than most are saying.The jokes are good and for that matter, I mostly point out Corey Stoll and his mostly comedic performance as MODOK.The script fails a lot, especially in the first act with the character of Janet Van Dyne and Cassie Lang. It also has some classic little conveniences, but that definitely won't get in the way of the movie!Kang, again the villain played brilliantly by Jonathan Majors is really menacing...
As for the post-credits scenes, only two characteristics: Confusing and Important-for-the-Future!"
6," Good, but the act it getting old
",mistela67,/user/ur22008378/,20 February 2023,"AMWQ is a good movie, full of exciting special effects, a powerful bad guy, lots of action and a spattering of comedy mixed in. Unfortunately, it stuck to the same cookie-cutter format that the MCU has been relying on, post EndgameI guess that could be considered good or bad news, depending on what you like to see. But I will say this, watching MCU movies as of late is like eating pizza everyday for, like, a couple of weeks straight. Love pizza, but too much of a good thing is never a good thing. I'm still waiting for something in these new Phases of the MCU to move me like I was moved in the early years of the MCU. Sadly, AMWQ doesn't do anything for me.I still don't know why Infinity War and Endgame seemed so damned good. I guess Infinity War and, to an extent, Endgame had more humanity to it. Those movies had character growth, more emotional interaction, more substance to who the actual players were and how they tied into the plots. Those movies surely had better quality writing, and the acting, as I remember it, was also much better than what I've seen in recent MCU movies. What I've noticed is that the MCU is trading quality scriptwriting for CGI, and the narratives are now focused on female heroes, and genius children/teen, whom also tend to be MENSA level scientist and inventors. I'm not stating that those people don't exists, but it's being overdone, almost forced on us (remember the pizza analogy).Couple this with some very poor writing (the way MODOK was challenged to conversion via a flurry of ""d*ck"" references was disgusting and cheap).So, yeah, Ant-Man/Quantomania is a good enough movie. It was fun to watch, and it will make money. I guess all these MCU movies will make money until they don't...which probably means people are finally getting sick of pizza.6/10 fun, but nothing unique here."

",jmpsnmailme,/user/ur149117666/,20 February 2023,"Best MCU movie since Spider-Man No Way Home. Acting was great, lots going on (maybe too much for casual viewers?), all with a wonderful message about importance of family. Introduction to a brand new villain that will be tied to the other films yet to come. It's not a perfect movie, certainly there were parts that were cringe, however most of it is fun, with some great weird visuals and action. I would have liked them to spend more time on certain characters to allow us to grow an attachment, but with a 2 hour runtime not sure what you cut out to get more in. I think most people's enjoyment will depend on the type of movie they are expecting going in."

",cruise01,/user/ur57691865/,20 February 2023,5 out of 5 stars.Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania is an awesome superhero film. Being the third film and while setting up a bigger threat to the mcu. Kang is an awesome villain. Giving him an insight and his motives to his evil agenda. It will be exciting to see more of him.The plot is great. Taking Ant man and his friends to quantumania where there is like a whole new universe of characters. While they are trying to escape it.The action sequences are exciting. The visual effects are awesome. The cast ensemble is great as always. Jonathan Majors delivers with his villain role. There is another surprise character without going into spoiler territories.There is a mid and post credit scene that is important. It is one fun wild ride of a film.
7," The writing is still weak, but i was smiling during the movie
",marauder-02891,/user/ur109061913/,20 February 2023,"If i want to be short:Is it worth to watch? Sure, it somehow made me smile at the cinema, and it is making you curious about Kang, especially with the two end credit scenes, but dont have too high expectations, just try to enjoy the ride, it has a few unexpected turns, but you get what you can expect from a family oriented Ant-Man franchise.If you want the long version:I will not be mean to Marvel, they get enough criticism from everyone.Kang is in the MCU, lets see how it will play out on the long run.""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantummania"" was a wild ride sprinkled with a lot of risk on the part of the storytellers, because i think they only had the concept of what they try to do but they had no talent to make this work.The characters were played well by the actors, i dont think any of their performances were that bad (maybe Modok and the daughter of Ant-Man felt REALLY out of place, but that was mostly because of the writing), the problem is that Marvel is unable to write a story what captures emotions. At all.When a character is well written, you know why you like it or why you dislike it, but Marvel in phase 4 failed to show the MCU fans why they should like their characters, they all feel generic, no trademarks or signature moves or character flaws/strenghts which would lift up the characters, the writing is not focusing on those things, but in the superhero genre these are the things which makes the fans go crazy for their heroes.I cant say that Marvel is not trying, but if it cant pin down EXACTLY what each character means for the MCU and for the fans then they cant move the masses.Ant-Man at least has Paul Rodd who can play the character and it is not hard to build the story around it.The reason why i am not willing to give this movie more than a 7 is because the concepts which are thrown into the mix now could have been more clear, more articulated, i cant stop thinking that the whole quantum world and quantum people thing was created half heartedly, just to have a plot device, nobody cares about them or their world and their only reason is to introduce Kang.I get it, it was easier to do it this way, but that means Marvel is taking shortcuts, and i am not a big fan of the idea.I felt Kang's presence, the actor did a good job, but even if it is the 3rd movie of the Ant-Man trilogy, i kinda feel like it did not have to be so family friendly, or that the family friendly part could have ended at the 2/3 of the movie and they could have gone for a hardcore ending, showing what Kang really is about, his resolve.The way the movie is now, it is a strong 6, i only gave it a 7 because i liked Kang, i liked Paul Rodd, but the story writing was still weak."

Not even a stellar cast like Rudd himself, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer and Bill Murray could save this movie.i am getting done with Marvel.

6," Nice to Look at But Otherwise Ho-Hum
",brentsbulletinboard,/user/ur156441404/,20 February 2023,"If you're looking for a dazzling display of special effects (especially in 3-D), then this latest installment in the Marvel Universe's ""Ant-man"" franchise is for you. However, if you're looking for an absorbing story, more along the lines of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" (2022), you'll probably want to look elsewhere, despite the superb eye candy on offer here. Though visually dazzling, director Payton Reed's latest feels like something of a placeholder entry in the ongoing string of movies in this long-running series of action-adventures. Set in a vividly colorful, fantastically landscaped universe that exists below our reality at the quantum level, this picture tells the story of an unlikely superhero (Paul Rudd) and his family of colleagues (Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathryn Newton) who become inadvertently trapped in this strange world and desperately look for a way to get home, but they must first match wits with a dastardly, powerful villain (Jonathan Majors) who stands in their way. What ultimately transpires, however, is a story that's eminently predictable and fairly formulaic, reminiscent of many other such tales, such as ""Tron: Legacy"" (2010). Also, like many other Marvel movies, the concluding sequence is once again entirely too long (even though the overall length of this production is, thankfully, comparatively shorter than many of its protracted peer releases). To its credit, the film features fine performances by Pfeiffer and Majors, as well as a commendably lucid explanation of the rudiments of quantum physics. However, these strengths, along with its stunning visuals, aren't enough to overcome the overall narrative blandness of this offering. While ""Quantumania"" is certainly best viewed on the big screen in 3-D for maximum visual effect, this film might otherwise be considered a candidate worth waiting for its streaming debut. The kind of overkill on display in this work isn't doing the Marvel Universe any good, something that really needs to be borne in mind for the future of these releases."

4," The Return of Mr. Electric
",jace_the_film_guy,/user/ur79005849/,20 February 2023,"The opening of this film is fantastic. I found myself laughing seconds after the MARVEL title rolled. Paul Rudd's performance as Scott Lang never feels like an act, as he naturally fits the role. His character is charming as ever in his 5th movie as Ant-Man.Marvel is known for extensive world-building and interconnected stories. Since 2021's ""Loki"", it has been known that Kang the Conqueror is the next Thanos-level villain in the MCU. This film gives us a deeper look at Kang, and the casting for his character (Jonathan Majors) is excellent.By leaving the regular world and diving into the world beneath (the Quantum Realm), the film relies heavily on green screens and computer-generated imagery (CGI). These graphics and effects are some of the poorest of the franchise, with a character called MODOK being the worst. There were times that the film was reminiscent of 2005's ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"".Other than the CGI, the biggest weakness in this film is the screenplay. From rushed plot points to painful dialogue, it is evident that the screenwriter had never written something of this magnitude. In the emotional and climactic moments, the script is so bad that it distracts from the story, with the audience in my theater audibly laughing.""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a small piece in the larger Marvel storyline. This is felt throughout the film, as the convoluted Quantum Realm and endless timelines are explored. The first two Ant-Man movies succeeded in simplicity, but this sequel was anything but simple. In short, the character of Scott Lang is better as the friendly, neighborhood Ant-Man.Best Character: Kang
Best Scene: Scott's Book Reading
Best Quote: ""I don't have to win. We both just have to lose!"" - Scott
Best Piece of Score: ""Theme from 'Quantumania'"" - Gives serious Avengers Campus vibes."

These people are paid millions of dollars to make good movies and they are paid more than they deserve because they have to take lip off a dummy like me. I long for the days when Superman was done with wires and looked fake versus what we get today - CGI that looks fake. Hey I know let's put some colors here and a swirl there, it will be beautiful - well, it wasn't.

Michael Douglas comes full circle. Scott's and Hope's story is solid, and the crazy cast of characters in the Quantum Realm are terrific. Great set up for the Kang era of Marvel. The end credits are very well done, especially the final one. All in all, I think this movie is very good, and I'll see it again!"
5," Marvels latest film falls short
",TheDanishMovie-Nerd,/user/ur157552764/,20 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and unfortunately, it falls short in comparison to its predecessors. While Jonathan Majors' portrayal of the villain Kang the Conqueror is impressive, the rest of the film disappoints.The plot revolves around Kang and his pressence in the quantum realm as well as Janet Van Dynes past in the realm. However, the story feels disjointed and lacks the coherence that previous MCU films have demonstrated.Despite the presence of a talented cast, the film fails to engage the audience fully. The humor, which is a staple of the Ant-Man franchise, feels forced and falls flat at times. The action sequences are also underwhelming and lack the excitement and tension that is expected from a Marvel movie. The overuse of CGI and the bad lighting that many scenes suffers from makes the movie feel rushed in production and not espacially appealing to look at.However, the one bright spot in the movie is Jonathan Majors' portrayal of Kang the Conqueror. Majors brings a menacing and compelling presence to the character, making him the only truly strong aspect of the film. His performance hints at the potential of this character for future films in the MCU and I could see myself viewing him as a villain on par with Thanos.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania fails to live up to the high standards set by previous Marvel movies. While Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang is notable, the rest of the film is lackluster and fails to engage the audience. It seems to be an ongoing problem with the latest MCU movies, which rely too heavily on CGI and action sequences at the expense of a well-crafted storyline and 3-dimensional characters."

There are strange life forms with cool tech and weaponry. And, there is plenty of over-the-top action, punches, and explosions. No, it isn't a complex, heady film, with a deep, meaningful message or plot. But, it doesn't need to be. It's exactly what it DOES need to be. A fun-to-watch bit of entertaining fantasy and escapism.

K, and marvel needs to stop with the green screens. Kang starts off as an imposing villain, but then the audience never gets to see what everyones so afraid of. Antman is a B team avenger, and he defeats the greatest multiversal Kang, how can any follow up Kang be taken seriously. Apparently this Kang defeated Thor, and I can't see how."
9," Great start to Phase 5- with a couple of exceptions
",kmthompson-53778,/user/ur162544854/,20 February 2023,"I would give this an honest 8.5, but I will be generous and round up to a 9. I went to the movie having low expectations given the rough critic reviews. I was surprised- I thought it should have been rated a bit higher than it was. I thought the acting was fantastic, the CGI was great (with the exception of MODOK). And the comedy was not too much (as it was in Thor Love and Thunder). The pacing was good for the most part, although some parts were a little slow.Personally, I think this was the best Ant Man so far, and it was my favorite Marvel movie since Spider Man No Way Home. Although there are a handful of better Marvel movies in the last five years, this was good enough to make me excited about upcoming Phase 5 movies."
10," What on earth are the critics watching?
",rwdelos5517,/user/ur18526750/,20 February 2023,"This movie is absolutely fantastic, with everything you'd want in a comic book adaption. Great cast, funny dialogue, heartbreaking dialogue, and a villain whom you can't help but feel hopeless against. At this point, people are just criticizing for just about no reason. Is it perfect? No. The Godfather is perfect. But, this movie is fun, sets up the future perfectly, and leaves you anticipating the future of its universe. Also has two of the best post credit scenes in any MCU film to date. Jonathan Majors is going to be a force in these films, and I for one can't wait to see his Kang take on the rest of the superheroes!"
5," okay film to watch nothing special.
",sarwarh789,/user/ur39465376/,20 February 2023,"After watching this movie, I'm glad I was around and was enjoying watching Marvel at its best. (Phases One to Three). Everything now and moving forward is just going downhill, production, acting, script, direction, and storytelling. This movie was okay nothing spectacular, again great for kids/teens these days so perhaps they may enjoy it more. Ant-man the original was a far better, relatable film with a really good storyline.I did enjoy the humour in this film, didn't feel like your typical marvel humour which was good to see, but everything else was just mehhh okay I guess, I don't want to use the word boring."
8," Honestly, better than you expect
",peteragordon,/user/ur74188451/,20 February 2023,"Honestly, this was the MCU film that two weeks pre-release I was most excited for in a long time. Kang, direction, answers and more were all teased. The trailers did nothing to reduce my anticipation.Then, the critics came out and announced their first reactions which were mixed but mostly positive. Then, their reviews came out and I was incredibly nervous. Watching the RT % drop each day was worrying. Then the audiences seemed to come and out and speak. At the time of writing it's at 84% and I was relieved.This is easily the best Ant-Man in terms of scale. If you're a fan of the small, contained palette cleansing Ant-Man films then you probably won't enjoy it as much.The cast are phenomenal with shout outs to Majors, Pfeiffer and Newton.The major grumbles that I have towards this film is the thing that stops it being one of the all-time MCU films:
1. The comedy. It intrudes too much and sets a weird balance of tone. We could have had a really dark storyline. The humour in places is great but often misplaced.2. Quantity. This is already the 8th film in less than 2 years not to mention the quantity of Disney+ shows. This is being rectified by Feige and co.Overall, if you want an enjoyable two hours that goes by insanely quick, this is for you. Trust the audience and not the critics.Also - stay for the mid and post credit scenes.In Feige and Kang we trust!"
5," Half baked
",vibhus-17780,/user/ur81435868/,20 February 2023,"Phase 5 of MCU kicked off with a half baked moviePros - Major positive of the movie was ""Kang the conqueror"" an intresting antagonist , brutal , ambitious , strong and terror , he literally carried the most part of the movie . Jonathan Major delivered an impressive performance , last time he played ""Me who remains"" in Loki series ( Last epi ) , contrast between this two characters was well shown in his performance . Asusual Paul Rudd as ""Scott Lang"" did a great job in his comical character . In third act particularly , face off between Antman vs Kang was brutal and literally rare from Marvel contents (like Green Globin vs Spiderman building fight sequence in NWH) . Post credit scene set's strong foundation to the upcoming projects and Multiverse Saga , best one in recent time . Comedy part worked well in few places .Cons - Usual plot and bland screenplay but somehow keeps out from getting bored . After well establishing the antagonist Kang , his ending in the movie wasn't convincing one . Asusual emotional part was spoiled by irrelevant comedy dialogues . Technically not upto the mark off Marvel standard , CGI and VFXs were too cartoonish and poorly executed in most of the places . Comparing to it's previous movies making was average . Clumsy editing , well noticed in 3rd act .Overall , movie could've been watchable one if they had done better in making and graphics . If you're a ardent Marvel fan then give it a try , because it has important details and sets a foundation for future projects . General audience , watch it your own risk . Not a kick off we expected for phase 5 ."
7," New variant of the same script: The Multiscript.
",lahilaastravnar,/user/ur133456720/,20 February 2023,"Big production, with good actors, magnificent CGI, and nice new elements, for a telling that is another deja vu. This script could have been written by chatgpt. Although Kevin Feige likes self conclusive film and TV series episodes, the time is too low to show a deep telling, and this is theresult: deja vu. Marvel is showing infinite variants of the same story. TV series has been saved from this cliché till now, doneting us original telling and great shows, but Kevin Feige said all this has to end: less series with more autoconclusive episodes. Probably this one will be the last Marvel movie I will see at Cinema. And if the depth of series will go down, I will stop to see series on Disney Channel. Sorry, but this is the business that is deleting the fantasy of Marvel and Disney old school: Marvel was a niche producer who gave us quality productions, now it has become a mainstream producer of mass-produced products. The future of entertainment appears more dark."
1," Too much, too fast and jumbled emotionless story
",Killerb44,/user/ur12009578/,20 February 2023,"Too much, too fast and jumbled emotionless story. It is not an awful movies but it does show how avengers will be full of women and men have to be shown as weak. Scott loses a lot of fights and the females in the story are always there to rescue him. On top of this it is yes another storyline where a girl is set to replace a guy in the hero role. Also the bad guy, Modok, becomes good because he is told not to be a d!ck. It makes no sense. At any rate the movie tries, once again, to put too much in this movie and it's a jumbled mess. It is worth a watch for the ant man character and Kang. But there is a lot you could fast forward through so I would wait until it's on Disney+."
7," Enjoyable if you're a sane Marvel Fan
",nicktaylor1017,/user/ur162428816/,20 February 2023,"As someone who has been a die hard fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe since it's inception, I can confidently say that this movie crack my personal Top 10 MCU films. This movie is a great overall introduction into who Jonathan Majors' Kang the Conqueror truly is. While at the same time further cementing Paul Rudd's Ant-Man from being a funny laughable franchise to a dark twisted nightmare. Everything that can possibly go wrong for the Lang- Pym family occurs throughout this film. The biggest question throughout the film was what was Janet Van Dyne AKA Michelle Pfeiffer so afraid of. After seeing the film I can understand her fear as Conquering is inevitable towards the MCU's future. Kang did not come here to play as he show cases his skills to the point where it's pretty clear that he will take that top spot as the Avengers biggest threat to date. Lastly, there are two post-credit scenes, they are worth the wait as they come off as the most important recent post-credit scenes to date pre-luring everything before Endgame."

",Pairic,/user/ur40547513/,20 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania: A fun SF/Superhero comedy romp where the three generations of insect people get sucked down to the Quantum World. Bill Murray plays a compromised resistance leader but Jonathan Moore eats up the (nano) scenery as Kangg, an evil dictator. All sort of creatures, sentient jelly blobs, heads composed of laser cannons, a veritable Star Wars mix, plus humans of a sort as well. Maybe this is one of the problems with the film: it has obvious influences from Star Wars, Stare Trek, Dune, even Flash Gordon.; it finds it difficult to out it's own stamp on tjings. But there are plenty of battles, jokes, one-liners and exotic machines. It provides two hours of entertainment. Directed by Peyton Reed, written by Jeff Loveness. 7.5/10."
10," Perfect start of the Phase 5
",ahsankhan-79903,/user/ur60559515/,20 February 2023,"Watched the movie last evening and honestly don't agree with or even see where the hate for the movie is coming from.I don't believe on critics. The movie is made for the audience, for us, not for the selected critics.Seems like majority of the audience loves the movie and my theater burst into applause after the movie.Quantumania is a huge, epic movie and a great start to Phase 5, a new dynasty.Kang is MENACING and you feel every bit of his power. The humor was handled perfectly in this movie and while they changed MODOK they did an amazing job with how they handled him.This movie is a solid 8.5/10 for me and has only increased my hype for the next two phases, especially for Loki 2."
," Soulless Waste
",jojunno,/user/ur6848692/,20 February 2023,"Marvel really has fallen and it can't get up. This is the third legacy character that they've absolutely wasted. In fact, for Doctor Strange, Thor and Ant-Man they not only wasted great established characters but superb casts. Add that they made Kang, the main villain out to be a chump and it appears Marvel has no plan moving forward. Not Kiang the conqueror but Kang the chump.This movie adds to the malaise of poorly written disappointments that is permeated the MCU since Endgame. With one of the worst third acts of any movie in recent history. MODOK use and ""dick"" turn could be the dumbest thing I've ever seen and that's not even a spoiler. He also ended the movie as if they ran out of budget. What an absolute waste."
9," Excellent movie
",kcwilsonii,/user/ur34619297/,20 February 2023,"Paul Rudd is in excellent form and they made sure not leave out the humor that he brings to these movies. Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas bring the drama needed to the film.You never got to see much of the Quantum world last time, but this movie brings it in to the light and displays some great imagination when it comes to the creatures and environment down there.Watch the end credit scenes both tie into later MCU movies coming out tin the future. One is at the very end.This is a family film so bring the kids some great stuff in the film from that perspective.The worst part of this movie was waiting for the movie to start. Nearly 30 minutes of ads ..etc absolutely terrible."
7," A very good film - The critics got it wrong.
",neilbowers,/user/ur73651971/,20 February 2023,"Having read the reviews from the so called critics. You'd think that this is the worst ever Marvel film in the franchise.However, please ignore these critics because clearly they'd been watching a different film to what I watched this afternoon.Since we last saw Scott Lang a lot has changed in his life. He can't walk down the street without people recognising him and he has also brought out a book about himself being an Avenger.Scotts daughter is a chip off the old block in that she has been in and out of prison. However, rather than steel things Cassie uses her new found knowledge to do good.This is where we find that during the 5 years of the blip Cassie and Hank Pym have been building a contraption that fires a signal down into the Quantom Realm. Which as we find out later isn't a good idea.Having opened the door way via the contraption to the Quantom Realm out heroes are dragged in but split up and spend time looking for each other.The quantom realm is like no other and they soon discover that other unkown species live in this realm but live in fear of an individual.When they find out that Janet Pym is back things look bleak because having spent 30 years in the realm and managing to escape things are not good.There is a short but funny cameo from Bll Murray who meets a sticky ending which leads to the introduction of Kang (Johnathan Majors) who is hell bent on conquering all the realms across the multi verse and has already conquered the quantom realm.Once he realises that Janet is back he goes on the offensive to crush the rebellion that is beginning to build up and seak his revenge for Janet leaving the realm with him still in it.Helping Kang conquer the universe is an old adversary from Ant Man, Darren Cross who has now become M. O. D. O. K. (Mechanised Organism Designed Only for Killing) and he does have some of the funnier lines in the film as well.The characters within the Quantom Realm are funny at times and the relationship between Cassie and Scott is really sweet and it also seems as though Scott has gained some respect from Hank Pym too.I'm not going to spoil the ending for you, as you'll just have to wait until you go and watch it or wait for around 6 months before it appears on Disney +.The graphics etc. Are really good representing the Quantom Realm. The acting isn't as bad as some of the reviews will make you believe.It is a bit slow in parts but to be honest i've seen worse films in the Marvel Universe (Thor: Love and Thunder) being one. But, it's a solid start to phase 5. Critics have no idea, It's a really good film."
6," If Marvel made plays and not movies
",pmjawn,/user/ur111959077/,20 February 2023,"Have you ever heard that line from Homer Simpson: ""now this movie is turning into a play.""? That's what I kept on thinking throughout the movie. It was way overboard on the theatrics, I would not have been surprised if it broke out into song and dance as that is where I thought the film was headed. And I really love Antman, he's my favorite MCU hero, but the movie did fall short. It's meant to be watched falling asleep on your couch with a Disney subscription and not in the theaters at $20 bucks for standard. On the positive side, I do look forward to Jonathan Majors being in the MCU, I just hope Disney doesn't turn the MCU into the Star Wars franchise. (You know what I'm talking about.)"

Not much more I can say with our adding spoilers.....
Looking forward to the next MCU movie that possibly ties up all these loose ends that have been left untied... .Make sure to stay for the two end credits scenes, yes, back to two end credit scenes..."

",aroydigi,/user/ur86980652/,20 February 2023,This is so mid because only post 2 credit scene is only I like it. There is nothing new experience and ripped off Star Wars are u kidding me ? BTW I already say it in lower bar but Ant-Man 3 go through the ground. Look like I have to shift to DC movies only James Gunn will understand the feel of real people movie test.How long this will getting to understand people are changing and this need to stop. Make some risk put an emotional villian witch I don't see in Kang. Plus there was no replication in this movies plus I didn't have time to watch hole MCU movies and series because there is to much that I didn't want to watch anymore after Endgame everything was an beautiful ending to MCU phase that I don't see anymore... !!!!
8," In think it's really good. Plz watch the movie and don't judge the movie on ratings, coz this was extremley comic based one❤ i love it❤❤
",dilshansandaru,/user/ur130981251/,20 February 2023,"Antman gave a good start to Phase 5& the Wasp Quantumania reviews are one example of not watching movies after being dependent.Especially, those who ask if they need to read comics to understand movies are confused. But for Marvel comic fans, this is a good movie for Kang.Not many cringe jokes like love & thunder have been added, Action & Storyline is quite good. Because the storyline of this is not completely finished, it will continue for another movie... If you don't have a good knowledge about the comic background, you won't be able to imagine who lost in the end.Visuals & Cinematography: Superb & Beautiful (Vfx artists should be seriously appreciated for the effort they put into this. Some scenes reminded me of the first movie Doctor Strange) It doesn't matter if you haven't watched this in 3D.Cgi: Good (Wakanda Forever has normal level. Talking about the characters, all the characters have been treated very well. Except MODOK.MODOK's origin and first appearance are badass. Even though it's pretty badass with the Face Shield/Armor, it's confusing when you show your face. But as said before, there is almost no movie that has successfully shown a giant floating head. So the look doesn't matter.But the character who has given some cringe dialogues from the middle is a mess.Kang is given an origin quite different from the comics and suitable for the MCU. Jonathan Majors was killing it. As I have been saying since the day Jonathan was cast, there is hardly anyone better than Jonathan as Kang. This Kang is an emotionally driven character. Seeing the expressions on Jonathan's face that he is a kang variant who is patient enough and can't bear it, the way he fights is professional.FeelIt is noticeable that he is like a boxer. Perhaps Jonathan may have used the experience he gained from Creed 3 for this one as well. The best thing about the movie is Jonathan Majors.And this is only one variant. We still haven't seen a dangerous Kang. Because like I said before, this is forwardA story that has to be continued... If you haven't seen the two Credits Scenes, you won't be able to imagine anything. If you don't understand, I'll watch all the videos about kang.) Credit damn Accurate to that scenefrom comicsChassy is fine. Because the character has been built beautifully as a person who is still learning to be a hero and is not amused by stories like I'm better than previous hulk/thor.Hank Pym My gosh, finally we saw him as he wasshould be. Although it was quite disappointing that Hank was not the age of iron man like Hank in the comics, but an old man, we get to see the badass Hank Pym like in the comics. And Janet & other characters are also okay.This story, which gives a good start to Secret Wars and Kang Dynasty, does not end here. So it can be said that the story has been done beautifully. Ratings don't matter. The movie is a perfect start to the Multiverse saga. Btw, don't make fun of the movie by commenting and spoiling it in the comments..."
2," quickly got bored
",sjo-15,/user/ur19847129/,20 February 2023,"It started off well. The bits set in the real world have humour and character.Then they go to the quantum realm and it falls apart. The vast majority of the film is CGI. Endless CGI. Too much CGI. Seen it all before.We are expected to care about a war happening in the quantum realm between two factions its hard to care about. We are told which side we should root for.Then at the end we are told we might have rooted for the wrong side - it might not be as simple as we thought.Then in true Marvel style something weird happens that has you questioning everything, including whether its worth it at all as they can now throw away all rules required for something to be realistic and have something we can root for, and do what they like.Paul Rudd can't save it, watchable as he is.Michelle Pfeiffer is miscast.Michael Douglas is under used, restricted largely to comic relief.The whole film is started by the actions of three characters who should know better, and if they behaved as they would in reality would never have carried out the actions that cause them all to be sucked into the quantum realm. Of course they shouldn't have been messing with what they were messing with... (Makes it even less believable).Might have worked better at 90 minutes - the length such movies used to - and should - be."
8," Why all the hate? It's not Weatherman, it's Antman.
",intrepidami,/user/ur7477130/,20 February 2023,"I know people are used to Scott being the butt of a hundred jokes and constant laughing through the first two movie. This is a different tone on purpose. This is Ant-Man fighting against a Multiversal threat. How big a bad? He mentions planning on taking down Eternity! And he's ominously cool and collected and supremely confident the whole time. Only when engaged in battle does he get angry, and when he's angry, watch out. He is but one of 1,000,000s of Kangs, and the rest are all afraid of him! People complained about MODOK. MODOK is supposed to look ridiculous. People complained about darkness. THEN STOP WATCHING PIRATED CAMS. There was never a too dark scene in the theatrical version. This is clearly an introduction movie, about the phase five big bad. It did what it is supposed to do. To load it up with laughs would mean an extra hour runtime. The movie showed Scott coming into his own as a fearsome hero! Joining the heavyweight class, instead of being ""tic-tac"". My guess is the early reviewers may have watched a screener that was darkened on purpose, Disney realizing it would be available on the net before the premier if they gave out a crisp clean copy."
1," Should be called, Janet and the Wasp
",fearlusbun,/user/ur152828076/,20 February 2023,"Antman completely overshadowed in his own film, belittled and made fun of for no reason other than to glorify a seemingly child genius and know it all Janet. Taking the same tropes as Thor Love and Thunder every concerning scene that could lead to danger is interrupted by terrible jokes or banter.A light-hearted fun action film starring Paul Rudd comedically growing or shrinking and dealing with that, has been simplified down to him being shamed for ""not helping enough"" even though he's had 2 movies and been a part of 4 now trying to help do just that.The plot is pointless, there are no real stakes, was this a movie just to introduce Hope as Antman's replacement? MCU movies now lack all depth and intrigue that they used to have."
6," No, Yeah No
",dorMancyx,/user/ur125833174/,20 February 2023,"""Phase Five"", ""Kang the conqueror"", ""multiverse"" --- it all sounds so monumental, but looks so tottering.Great visual effect (shout out to the VFX workers), as illustrated in a motley of scenic, architectural, and environmental designs; especially the long shot of the flight sequence, which captures the flamboyant otherworldliness of quantum realm. Action wise, the movie presents a short yet meticulous combat scene between Kang and the Ant-family, displaying tacit combos and fluent choreography. Moreover, giant Ant-Man demolishing the citadels is quite similar to AOT, and the way Kang suspends the hurtling cane gives me Kylo Ren vibes, not to mention the quantum species are really comparable to the aliens of Star Wars, which are all nice little allusions in my opinion but could be a sign of Marvel's creativity fatigue. And here goes the negatives.I'm sorry, but Cassie's actress is terrible at portraying her character, showing no emotions facially or within the eyes when her father falls off a cliff or gets beaten to death by the villain, which contrasts farcically to her anxious voice. Introducing terrible ""New Avengers"" is hereditary as we've seen in Phase Four (Iron Heart, Kate Bishop, America), which is why Stinger is even more frustrating and illogical of a character: unreasonably caring, doted by her family, and excuse me incited a local rebellion as a two-day visitor? Speaking of which, the rebels demonstrate so potent a motive with so little characterization, as they seem even less important to the plot development that actual ants. And speaking of ants, how in the flabbergasted-ness do ants overpower the timeline-shattering Thor-killing multiverse-conquering Kang? I understand how Jonathan Majors is grinding to perform this so-called ""ultimate antagonist"" of Phase Five and Six with contorted facial expressions and balefully imperious tone, yet Kang's failure in the film simply makes this villain far less menacing. Though titled ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"", the movie leaves no room for Scott (I'm sorry Paul you tried) or Hope (basically Black Widow but only the stingers) to literally and figuratively ""grow"" as main characters. Michelle and Michael's chemistry is the only landing ground for comedy (oh yeah the jokes suck btw); though in terms of between-character scenes, I loved the backstory of Janet and Kang, as their brief interaction exhibits a mother's yearning and a warrior's sympathy with pure dialogues and micro-expressions, which in turn deepens the duo's contradiction.If this was a film of Phase Four, I'd let it slide with a 7/10. However, we're in a new Phase with new expectations, and the customers will not be satiated with Marvel serving the same meal as before."
5," A KANG SHOW !!!
",shaikhirshad-41223,/user/ur99503134/,20 February 2023,"This movie is just made for the Introduction of a Kang. Otherwise there is nothing proper that seems to have build up in this movie. First of all JONATHAN MAJORS as KANG is PURE GOOSEBUMPS. What a performance by him literally Stoles the show from everybody. The way he portrays the role of kang is simply superb. Story and plot is very weak as compare to previous antman movies. J don't why so rush director has to introduce kang if you don't have a proper story and you all just rely on Kang's Shoulders. I'm shocked to see that Wasp doesn't even have a proper dialogue in the whole film I mean literally she is one of the main characters and you didn't even give her the proper role she deserves. Very poor writing, Screenplay is fast very fast paced doesn't even build the main characters properly and rush to conclusion. CGI is good but 90% characters are CG so sometimes it is hard to connect with the new ones. Paul Rudd as antman is promising but he should deserves better. Janet in her role is amazing and good to watch. Storywise movie is very average but the performance of KANG save the film and the mid-credit & post-credit is the highlight of the film do not miss that....(5/10)"

Just like other big name characters like the Hulk, Hawk Eye, and Thor. Is there a flu that makes them all act the same?Terrible script writers who know nothing about Marvel Comics.Kang the Conquerer is suppose to be an over-arching villain, the most important Kang and he's like a chump in this movie. Another villain made pointless in a useless movie, just like Namor in Wakanda Forever.There's no importance or deadliness to the Villains anymore. Now Marvel is starting to trash their best villains. Why? This is basically writers who have no idea how to write from Comic to Film or know anything about the characters.Instead of establishing Modok as a good character, he's another throw away joke villain. The character belongs with A. I. M, X-men and Captain American; what's he doing in an Ant Man movie? Do Marvel Script writers even read Marvel Comics?These are hollywood writers who live in their own bubble and think the Wasp saving every part of the world, is what a character should be.Pathetic."

",dlinderman-55448,/user/ur61379422/,20 February 2023,"First of all - Jonathan Majors as Kang is gold.I loved every second he was on screen. Both the actor and the character itself were amazing in my opinion.Outside of that... I didn't enjoy it much.It's never good when I find myself looking at my watch during a movie at a theater. None of the jokes landed with me at all, I didn't laugh at a single thing throughout the film even though it was evident they tried to get some laughs.Paul Rudd was okay, but at times felt like he was phoning it in. Pfiefer's character was the most unnecessarily likable thing in the whole film too. ""I know all this bad stuff about the multiverse but I'll tell you later"" became her mantra in this film. Did they NOT have enough time for her to give a condensed version while wandering through the CGI world?I know I'm getting a little burned out on the amount of Marvel films and shows, and that might sway my opinion a little, but this film absolutely failed to reach my expectations for the true start of Kang the Conqueror. And while Majors did an amazing job, and Kang is now a character I look forward to seeing more of in the coming films, this entry failed to impress me the way I thought it would."

",unknowman-19320,/user/ur159841591/,20 February 2023,"WARNING SPOILERS!:The problem with this movie is the terrible punchline, unnecessary jokes, Modok and cringy scripts.I don't like for a movie about Kang, they had to make it look funny and put some jokes at very unnecessary moments. It takes the tension out a lot and breaks the moment.Modok was nothing but a joke. I was genuinely surprised and was quickly invested in him when I found out he was Darren from the first movie but yet again his lines were trash and a wasted potential to be a side villain to add more drama into this movie. In Aquaman, Black Manta was in the same position but was utilized way more effectively.They should take time to develop the tribe/people of the quantum realm especially the buff women who was in this movie a lot.Don't pay huge actor and kill them the next two minutes. You're giving fake hope to the audience and made them angry.Improve the script man. Seriously, the conversation that Modok and Cassie had about stop being a dick cringe a whole LOT and the iconic line the trailer where Ant Man said ""we both just have to lose"" mean nothing at all. Like, I thought he was gonna trap himself in the quantum realm leaving him and Kang in that place in order to protect his family or something but no. He won and happy ending.Overall, a good enjoyable movie but way too flawed. Great storyline, villain, plot and pacing. Tho questionable tone.Edit: Oh, I also don't like that Modok always stop whenever he had the chance to kill Cassie, ""oh there's no way to run Cassie you're trap"" like bro just finish her already."
6," Should have been much more darker
",hanseugen,/user/ur6096376/,20 February 2023,"While the MCU Phase 4 was quite underwhelming, despite Movies like Spiderman and Series like, Wandavision, What if and Loki I was really looking forward to Quantumania. I was hoping that Kangs first apperance in the MCU would be remarkable but looks like Kevin Feige and his crew were not brave enough for that. While you get a glimpse of Kangs power in some scene it's not enough to win against Antman and this is where I have a problem with the movie. It should have been, much, much darker. Now we need to wait until Loki 2 for a pick up of the story line as I don't expect any input from GotG 3 for it."
6," An underwhelming start to Phase 5
",pranayjalvi,/user/ur62249628/,20 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp : Quantumania starts the beginning of the Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and to be honest it's an underwhelming start to say at the least.Most part of the movie is in Quantum Realm and yes the CGI/visual effects were good as always, however the pacing and the whole setting itself looked too formulaic and repetitive, as if the movie was trying hard itself to prove it as a Marvel movie. The antagonist of the movie had a very brief impact on the whole movie, given that he was supposed to be one of the strongest. Jonathan's role as Kang was the positive takeaway, with an expectation of appearing in future films as well.Although it felt very generic with nothing new to offer, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a fun MCU entry that gives a hope of jumping into a new saga with something interesting to offer.My Rating : 6/10."
8," To understand this movie Loki series is a must watch
",maheshmm-76826,/user/ur157771244/,20 February 2023,"Note : If you haven't watched Loki Series, there is no point of you watching this movie and come here to give a negative review.To understand this movie , multiverse and all about Kang the conqueror you must watch Loki Series to understand the concept.Movie starts a bit slow with mixture of humour and fun. The second half of the movie is amazing.Goosebumps moment: when the Ants come at war with the team.We have 2 post credit scene. One which shows all the other variants of Kang ( again to understand this u should have watched Loki series)2nd post credit scene goes on where Loki and Mobious go on to find another variant of Kang (should have watched Loki series to understand this)As a whole it is a good movie compared to all the other phase 4 movies."
10," Like Doctor Who and Starwars gave birth to sheer brilliance
",juliangabrielgray,/user/ur142705847/,20 February 2023,"As my review title suggests, this movie was like a great superhero movie meets Journey to the Centre of the earth, then Doctor Who and Starwars gave birth to sheer brilliance.It was complex, creative and visually stunning.There was humour, sadness and multiple complex emotions envoked but the greatest being shock & awe (if that's considered one emotion).The actor that played Kang is an acting chameleon and I can't wait to see what he does next in the next MCU phase.The introduction of a proper multiverse setting was extremely cool and even more so the introduction of the battleworld where multiple new next phase products will be housed.10/10."
9," I'm not sure what the hate is about
",jwburke93,/user/ur30950919/,20 February 2023,"People are acting like this movie is the latest Thor, it's not. It does have some silly moments. But there are plenty of intense moments as well. I went to go see this movie this afternoon and I finally felt like the MCU has hit its stride again. I feel like it's been awhile. I have not been a fan of the new marvel shows, I've honestly felt like they've been pretty lost. This is the first movie that has felt like the MCU is heading towards something, although it may not be the extract thing people guess. All I will say is that people need to give this movie a chance. I'm not a fanboy or a boy, I feel like a lot of the votes are from bots. It's a good movie and deserves a chance."
7," Not a bad movie, not the most exciting
",torgis,/user/ur126446324/,20 February 2023,"I might be the last person on earth who doesn't compare every movie I watch to another, I feel like comparisons can ruin any movie for someone.I thought this one was a pretty good movie. I can't say there was a moment I remember where I was genuinely concerned for the main characters' well-being or safety, or any memorable ""emotion"" moment (but to be fair, that doesn't happen too often). I was a little annoyed with Janet for a good portion of it and I'm still not a huge fan. I liked Cassie, thought her character was a pretty good interpretation of the comic character, but much smarter. I agree it wasn't as light-hearted as previous Ant-Man appearances, but I think the situation warranted it. I loved Kang, thought that was done very well. Interested to see how it plays out in the long-run."
7," Loved movie
",gavraskaranand,/user/ur158453343/,20 February 2023,"I have watched it and loved it. But there were some useless jokes in the movie which I thought shouldn't be in the movie. Aswell movie has really good plot and story but some flaws also there aswell has some good moments, and cool visuals. However if you look a little deeper, a lot of things stand out. Like the fact that they were harvesting quantum energy from the quantum realm in the post credits of the last movie, yet Janet didn't seem concerned, even though she is very worried about the quantum realm, which they show in the trailer, so it's not something you'd only gather from watching the movie."
6," It's fun... but not everything works...
",parksiet,/user/ur73501762/,20 February 2023,"What happens when you're solely focused on your next big Endgame and try to stuff 6 hours worth of stories into a 2-hour movie? You get a Quantumania. Hours of content being shoved down our throat with absolutely no time to process any of it. But beyond it being overstuffed, all of the charm from the first two movies (specifically the first) has vanished. A lot of Ant-Man's appeal was his operation in a normal sized world, either tiny or large- but when the world he occupies is larger than life itself, the effectiveness of that charm is gone. It has no heart. It is just spectacle for the sake of spectacle.I sound angry. I'm not, I have to say I did like the movie. Quantumania is a fun sci-fi adventure filled with goofy comic book weirdness! It is far from Marvel's best, but I did have a fun time. But there are so many issues... so let me back up a bit and start over...Martin Scorsese's views on comic book movies are no secret; he claims they are more like theme park rides than true cinema. For years, I have staunchly disagreed with this stance, I love the Marvel Cinematic Universe and found so much to appreciate in their films. But after seeing Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, y'know what?He might be right.It pains me to say this, but Quantumania is not a great film. To be clear, I enjoyed the movie. I'd even give it a thumbs up! But it is a fun movie, not a good one. It is, by all accounts, a theme park ride.And frankly, that disappoints me.I come to Marvel for the characters I love, the heart and emotion in the stories, and yes, for the fun superhero action. Infinity War and Endgame were such huge successes not because of how fun they were but because of how they captured people's imaginations and emotions. People felt tied to the characters and couldn't wait to see them all come together. I for one, was so emotionally invested in those films, and all of Marvel at the time.Why do I bring that up? Well, because I felt nothing while watching Quantumania. There is no emotional weight to it, nothing compelling me to invest myself in the story. It is all spectacle, and no substance. I felt so empty coming out of it. It felt so forgettable and I never seemed to actually get into the movie. I just couldn't buy into what it was doing. And I am so crushed to say this, because I was looking forward to this movie so much! I really wanted to love it, but alas, it is the first Marvel movie in a while that I have come very close to not liking.I love the first Ant-Man film, and its sequel Ant-Man and the Wasp has even grown on me over the years. This one felt nothing like them. An Ant-Man film it is not, lacking the spirit and everything else that made the franchise what it was. It is completely different, and delves into very odd corners of the MCU. Doing this isn't a bad thing, but I mourned the loss of the charm that the first two films had. I loved the small-scale heist plots. I loved the simple narrative of a dad trying to get more time with his daughter. I loved the unique action set-pieces; battles taking place on a toy Thomas the Tank Engine, or using a Hello Kitty PEZ dispenser as a weapon. I loved Michael PeÃ±a's character, Luis, and his awesome storytelling! It had this really heartfelt and likeable element to it, and was different from what we were used to in the rest of the MCU. Yes, the films did serve as a sort of ""palate cleanser"" after the big Avengers films, but that worked for them! I think the decision to make the third Ant-Man film an ""Avengers-level event"" movie was a mistake, because that essentially forced them to get rid of everything that made these films special. (Including Michael PeÃ±a which I will never forgive.)And I gotta blame director Peyton Reed here. He bit off more than he could chew. I can understand wanting to do one of the bigger Marvel movies as the Ant-Man ones are on the smaller side of the universe, but forcing the Ant-Man franchise to become one of the major events was a big mistake. It didn't work. Frankly, Peyton Reed was operating in his niche with the first two films, and he's just completely out of his element with this one. You can tell he is trying so hard to make it a big sci-fi spectacle, but comes up short in almost every way. He just got a little too ambitious. Tonally the film is all over the place, the pacing doesn't make sense, action scenes are cut together really oddly and the film overall seems to have no vision. It just sort of exists. Even with the action scenes, there are no memorable moments, and frankly there were barely any real action scenes in the film. I really can't help but wonder what this trilogy would have looked like had it been helmed by Edgar Wright (who was originally supposed to write/direct the first film).And like I said, it doesn't work as an Ant-Man film by any means. Sure, it has the characters, but them being in the story doesn't change anything. The only characters truly used in the film are Janet van Dyne and Kang. The rest were completely wasted. Scott (Ant-Man) doesn't even have a character arc, he is just kind of there, alongside Hope (the Wasp) and his grown-up daughter Cassie. The characters are likeable and I love seeing them on screen, but they really had nothing to do, and it just felt like what happens when characters show up for cameo appearances in other character's films. The problem is this is an Ant-Man film with no real story for Ant-Man. He feels miscast in his own story, heck, it was unnecessary for him to even be there, and the film never truly explained why he could take on Kang. I just never believed any of it. The film lacked verisimilitude, in terms of character, plot and world-building.Jeff Loveness really needed someone else here to help flesh out his script. It feels like a shell of a great movie. Dialogue isn't great, for one, but that's minor. There are lots of moments that work, but they never add up to anything. There is never any weight to what happens either, it felt like things would happen with no setup or reasoning at all, they just would happen because they had to in order to progress the plot. It's a very by-the-numbers plot that barely holds up and steals so much from other films such as Star Wars. But not great Star Wars... the one I would compare it most to is Rise of Skywalker. Why would you take so much from that? The structure of the film is a mess too, with no discernible 3-act structure - the characters end up in the Quantum Realm, stuff happens, and then all the sudden we're at the end. It just felt like there was no buildup, no real reason for this story to be told. Heck, I try to think back on this movie and it's just a jumbled blur of colours and meaningless content. It's so forgettable and lifeless. It's such a missed opportunity for a great Ant-Man story. (And at this point I wouldn't mind giving them the chance to do an Ant-Man 4 *properly*.) Frankly, there were missed opportunities throughout the entire film, and most of the issues stem from the writing. I really hope either Loveness can come up with a significantly better script for Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, or that Marvel finds a new writer for it... if we're in for more of this in an Avengers movie... count me out.The worst thing is that I'm here complaining about the movie when there were still so many things I liked about it! I can genuinely see how some audiences are enjoying it more than I did, as many standalone elements I really liked and even loved! The problem is, they just never came together to make me love them all as a final product. I liked many of the creative ideas offered up, I really liked the visuals of the Quantum Realm (even if you could very much tell it was shot on green screen/the volume), I liked seeing all the new and returning characters and cast members (Paul Rudd is fantastic and charming as always (too bad he didn't have more to do here), Michelle Pfeiffer is awesome here, and I really liked Kathryn Newton as a grown up Cassie), and I LOVED Kang.Before I go into anything else let me make one thing very clear: Jonathan Majors is INCREDIBLE as Kang the Conqueror.There are some amazing actors in this movie, including Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer, but Jonathan Majors puts them all to shame. He truly carries the movie; the only times I truly found myself invested were when he was on screen. He is operating leagues above everyone else! He is so menacing and truly embodies the threat of Kang. I was completely blown away by his performance, he stole the entire movie and then some! Truthfully, he was so compelling I found myself almost rooting for him! Kang was even a fantastically written character, he worked the best out of any character in the film and I am super interested to see how they handle both Kang and Majors in the future. But my god, Jonathan Majors can truly do no wrong, he is giving an emotionally acrobatic performance that this film and franchise does not deserve. For instance, much like with Gorr in Love and Thunder, we are only told of what Kang is capable of and what he has done but never shown. Film is a visual medium, it would've been nice to see some of the events we hear about occur, but luckily we have such a fantastic performance from Majors that it's hard not to see Kang as a major threat!Which brings me to an interesting thought... why didn't they just make this a Kang the Conqueror movie? Marvel has never done a villain-centered piece before and it could have been pretty interesting - and certainly would have worked a lot better than this. This film pretty much only works as Part 1 of Marvel's Phase 5 anyways, all the Ant-Man stuff could have been saved for something else, something more fitting.I love Marvel, I really do. It's why I'm being so critical of their missteps when they happen, because I don't want to have to write this again. But they need to step up their game."
8," ENTER THE REALM
",wolverinexfitxmma,/user/ur154260804/,20 February 2023,"ANTMAN 1 explains Michael Douglas role in his involvement in SHIELD and his research on the quantum realm. And the space time continuum. Explains him as the original ANTMAN and his Wife the Original WASP then their daughter.... and Paul Rudd character as a thief and Douglas using his talents. Douglas vs Hydra.ANTMAN 2 explains Douglas and his wife's involvement and research in the quantum realms, how she disappeared for 30 years.Now the third installment finally explains what she did in those 30 years. She helped a person release from prison. After being exiled for crimes that were done against him and now he wants revenge. Unfortunately his vehicle was damaged and Phiefer helped him repair his ship so he can complete his mission. She unknowingly help orchestrate a being that would enslave a world.Phiefer really had no place in a superhero film. She is good for drama films. Douglas was perfect as the brains behind the suits. Kang brought an interesting development for the new Avengers film. Kang Dynasty. Will be a interesting installment. I love how each character of the avengers movies brings a piece of the story together."
7," You Know What.......
",owenpont-70803,/user/ur143796475/,20 February 2023,"Does this film have problems. Yeah, and are the obvious? Yeah, but is this film fun? Absolutely. For this film to have such a low rotten tomatoes score shocks me. I thought Antman And The Wasp Quantumania was going to suck, but it actually wasn't horrible. For one, Jonathan Majors steals the show as Kang. He delivers a powerful performance and runs the movie the entire time. And the entire film reminds me a bit of Star Wars so thats a plus. The main problem to me is the ending and the crazy amount of plot conveniences and basic pure stupidity put in this film. I think they needed to explain somethings in this film and fix its ending to fully pull me in to the Quantum world. But overall, this was still at its central core, a fun enough, enjoyable marvel film. And at the streak marvel has been going. This film is more of a plus then a minus."
6," Same old burger...
",Drawmort,/user/ur44965663/,20 February 2023,"This film is light and basic, with fast-paced action sequences that are always accompanied, framed and structured under layers and layers of CGI, with Marvel-style humor, Marvel-style heroes and Marvel-style villains.The paragraph you just read has a latent ambivalence and can clearly be used for many MCU movies. It's ambivalent because it can be what a lot of people look for in a movie, but it can also be the cause of what they call ""creative fatigue"" after dozens of films under the same formula, for a genre that rarely shows anything new, just changes settings and characters.Which side am I on? Well, Quantumania entertained me, because of its action, science fiction and adventure. The villain is a good antagonist, who has a decent development compared to previous villains, has great powers, but I admit that he was defeated perhaps very easily. Are there flaws? Of course! M. O. D. O. K falls into the category of wasted villains like Task Master and the humor is pretty ineffective. Although I don't hate this type of content, I don't think it's the great wonder either. It's your average superhero movie, which you'll like more or less depending on your mood.Now, let's face the fact that this is MARVEL-level cinema. It's not a high standard, never has been. We just have another product of the great machinery headed by Feige. The purpose has always been to entertain mostly teens and young adults. If we see Quantumania through that prism, it seems to me that the film fulfills its mission. It's a warm bath in the waters of CGI, which even tries to reach older generations by incorporating clear references to legendary sagas like Star Wars, but in a much more psychedelic way like the recent Strange World or as someone said out there, in the style of Moebius, although perhaps we are exaggerating a bit with this last statement. Now, if we're going from this movie alone to say that Marvel is fatigued, I don't believe it. Let's leave that excuse to She-Hulk and Ms. Marvel.This is just the same old burger pulled from the same food chain started in 2008 with Iron Man."
6," A let down and Predictable
",Beesmiley,/user/ur157972303/,20 February 2023,"I'm a huge Marvel fan so was excited initially to see this. Things got predictable very fast and I found myself just counting down time for the movie to be over after the first 20 minutes. Some parts of the father daughter theme throughout the movie made things corny, should've kept the daughter as a secondary character.The Predictable - The machine gets broken at the beginning and somehow wisps everyone in, predictable. Near the end when the villain is winning, ants come from nowhere to help save the day, predictable.Also, what was up with all the irrelevant sexual references?I left the theatre not satisfied in the end, I recommend you wait for this one to get to Disney plus."
7," Not as bad as the reviews say
",wendieta,/user/ur75218339/,20 February 2023,"First of all, this movie is not perfect. It's definitely not one of the strongest MCU movies, but it's certainly not the worst. After being treated with poor phase 4 movies, this movie feels pretty good. It's much better than the likes of Eternals and Thor Love and Thunder. Majors is a good choice to play Kang, but I feel he wasnt given a very good script for this movie. MCU's biggest problem has always been the villains, and to some extent, it's the case here too. Kang is supposed to be an avenger-level villain, but it doesnt show it here. He has the presence and powers, which he shows when he threatens scott and cassie and freezes janet, but when it comes to the final battle, he doesnt use those powers. Instead he uses his energy beam thing, which I think is not as effective. He couldve destroyed the ants easily, but no. He even got his suit damaged by the ants. There are plenty to like about this movie though. Paul rudd is great as ever, and kathryn newton is refreshing. I like how she's not suddenly a strong and experienced fighter even though she has the suit. I do miss michael pena and TI, but I understand they wouldve been underused if included. Overall I think it's a solid, though not great, entry. I gave it a 7 because I found it entertaining enough, and that it marks the beginning of the Phase 5, which has potential."
5," Ridiculous
",mohafinearts,/user/ur89026616/,20 February 2023,"One of the worst screen play in the series. It is ridiculous in many scenes, predictable. Many scenes even have conflicts with characters.

This movie was to set up the next chapter in Marvel and it did that. I hope most stayed after the credits, just like most marvel movies, there is always more. But they tried to keep it kid friendly which is hard when you have a powerful village like Kang. I think they could have push the violence up a little more. I'm hoping they cover Kang a little more so fans that don't know him as much, can really learn who is and why he is the way he is. Overall, a great movie. Make sure you have seen the other ant man movies as well for a better understanding of the current events. Also watching Loki on Disney plus also will help as well. It all ties together."
9," A thoroughly enjoyable marvel movie. Don't listen to the hate!
",hmyvzxr,/user/ur134293007/,20 February 2023,"Marvel Studios know how to create ultimate fantasy and this Ant-man movie doesn't disappoint. Action starts within the first 15 minutes and you are immediately transported into a world of chaos and wonder. They introduce new characters which are comic book accurate and Kang as a villain is incredible. He is in enough of the movie to keep you wanting more and a great villain set up for further plot lines.Don't listen to the hate! With so much rubbish on Television, we need more of escapes like this. Creativity at its best.It's easy to criticise for the sake of finding flaws. Ant-man may not be the most popular super hero, but he has earned his place in the MCU.Well done Marvel!"
1," What the heck was that?
",smushsucks,/user/ur41533081/,20 February 2023,"I think it was during Guardians 2 I thought to myself 'You know if Starlord just used the powers his dad gave him, he could just bring his mom back and end the movie without a final battle.' The simple act of having a Marvel superhero listen and communicate better would eliminate a lot of the frustration of foisting a big battle scene into the end of the movie.In the case of Antman 3 they could have canceled the whole movie. Antman doesn't communicate with his daughter (who magically created hardcore science by 'reading her father's girlfriend's dad's notes'!?!). No movie, over in five minutes. If Hank Pym had a five minute conversation with his wife about the dangers of the multiverse he would not have thought letting a teenager play with it would be a good idea. No movie, over in five minutes. If Kang had a conversation with Mrs Pym, at any point during their thousands of hours fixing their multiverse machine, she would have either decided not to help or understood him better. Nope. If Antman's daughter hadn't told him saving the world meant nothing and he was lazy, perhaps he would have found a way to engage her more in his work. Nope.The movie was so poorly written it was hard to focus on how a massive city (looking like it could fit millions) was overrun at the end by an army of a couple hundred people. It was hard to fathom why the head of the bad guy from the first movie was reanimated for comic relief; and was repeatedly and easily defeated after they introduced him as the genius/genocidal killer who dragged them into the Quantum Realm. Why is Bill Murray in the movie? You could delete that scene completely and just say they got captured when they entered the city because everyone seems to know who Mrs Pym is.Trainwreck from beginning to end and a waste of money. A total insult to people who enjoyed the early Marvel movies. It's hard to believe how far Marvel has fallen since the end of Phase 3."
4," Firm not good
",maytinhdebansg,/user/ur162525347/,20 February 2023,"The movie is beautiful but not good, too many stones
Solve the situation too quickly
The villain Kang initially built very well, but the ending did not show anything, at the end of the movie, the feeling of strength was even lost to Iron Man, even at the part where the ants were spared, he couldn't understand how to get out. .Do everything to get the core, but when you have it, you don't know how to keep it, fight and then be broken again and die, too badAnt-Man is over-buffed, it doesn't matter how many guns are fired, but at the end of the movie, when Kang kicks with normal strength, his hat breaks, it's really too much to watch."
7," Leave your expectations and enjoy
",markallenchi,/user/ur75256941/,20 February 2023,"Not as bad as some have made it out to be. Definitely mid/lower tier Marvel, but also fun and enjoyable. It's not Endgame,but that's OK. This is 100 times better than Eternals and Love and Thunder. Probably better than the first two Ant Man/Wasp movies. This gives me Guardians 2 vibes.Good
Kang definitely had his moments. Michelle Pfeiffer looks/is amazing. The movie really should have focused more on Kang's history and why he was exiled.was he the good Kang? MODOK was ridiculous but they played to that point.Bad
The rebels and Billy Murray took away from the main characters. Cassie was annoying and poorly written. The post credit costumes are TERRIBLE. Like, High School drama club terrible."

The only downside is Luis isn't in it. It all makes sense story wise, short term and long term, and it sets up a lot of suspense for future movies and series in phase 5. People are just comparing every single marvel production to endgame now and in comparison they say it all falls short. It might not have the same overload of fan service, but I prefer that. I wouldn't listen to the hive mind on this one, I want to go and see it again! Doesn't have many of the issues that many recent marvel productions have had."

Because the only thing that's good in this movie is where Jonathan Majors appears.Majors, honestly it's Kang, but the script, the direction, are not even close to the level of his performance, I literally feel that Majors is caged in this, this script garbage, and I feel that everything that happened in the movie and the way Kang perishes, is silly, stupid ... and disappointing, the MCU should take some time, because this phase aims to be worse than the previous one."

We sat down, knowing we were going to get Paul Rudd's humor mixed with a set-up story, and had absolutely no problem with it.Was it Marvel's best? No. Neither was Ant-Man, or Ant-Man and the Wasp. These are fun stories that sit on the side and somewhat add to the rest of the Marvel Universe while being funny, thought-provoking, and entertaining.I enjoyed seeing the (Not!)-Micronauts on the screen. I saw them in the commercials, and was excited to see a version (that was really, truly NOT the Micronauts, mind you) in the film, since they (the Not-Micronauts) come from the same realm.If you're going in expecting something massive like Avengers, you're too spoiled. Enjoy it for what it is. Don't read other reviews until you've seen it, and then get other's takes. Seriously. :D."

8," It's Marvel meets Star Wars!!!
",bhernandez2216,/user/ur53037576/,20 February 2023,"This movie was pretty enjoyable! Paul Rudd still nails as Ant-Man and Jonathan Majors was brilliant as Kang, and the performance choice for the MCU! Jonathan's performance was phenomenal and he has done a great job playing Kang the Conqueror!Evangeline Lilly did a very well job with Hope / The Wasp, and Michelle Pfeiffer was also fantastic with her part for Janet van Dyne, and Kaitlyn Newton did a good job as well, and same goes for Michael Douglas, one of the most brilliant actors in Hollywood who made his great acting career in the spot light.To me it felt like Marvel meets Star Wars for the very first time in the Multiverse, and I gotta say it felt like it has pretty good vibes, when you think about it.The director Peyton Reed did a pretty good job with his third installment and to all of his previous films like Ant-Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp. Sure the third installment had pretty different story to tell, but to me it was pretty entertaining when it comes to the MCU!Not bad Quantumania! Not bad."
6," Above average entertainer
",shanemessman,/user/ur147826688/,20 February 2023,"Marvel phase 5 kicks off with the taste of Ant Man. Some high expectations with average results. The movie takes a ok start getting the audience in. As soon as the plot takes over the movie starts feeling really slow the action doesn't feel good. The climax is when the movie actually does it's best. Everything happening all at once with great intensity states. Action feels appealing with a solid purpose. Acting is best by Paul Rudd and the villain, others were ok with the acting. Comedy is fairly kicked in certain times feels good. The runtime is actually fine but plot makes it feel slow.Suggesting better pace would boost this film."
1," The official beginning of the end for marvel
",dfttnhvm,/user/ur135740231/,20 February 2023,"This is the worse written most nonsensical marvel movie, what a waste of 300 million, Paul Rudd seems like an extra in his own movie, Kang is easily defeated, dumb comedic tone, the quantum universe is poorly designed, the daughter is more powerful than modor, first time she uses the suit and she's a master, almost single handedly defeats Kang gimme a friking break, the way they handle the whole movie is a clear sign that the whole marvel universe is tired and should retire, they handle the whole quantum verse however is convenient to their badly written plot, just doesn't make sense at all, it's not even entertaining, cgi looks 20 years old, no emotion no climax no nothing, marvel you're done go home."
," Gilded Era of Marvel
",AvalonFour,/user/ur105874009/,20 February 2023,"If you're a VFX nerd like me and watch Marvel movies for the visuals, then you will love this movie. If you go to the movies to watch an actual good movie, save yourself the time and money.Visually, this movie is stunning. Props to everyone on the visual effects team. That's what all 4 of my stars are for. As a VFX artist myself, I can tell that an unbelievable amount of work went into making this movie look great.However, I named this review the ""Gilded Era of Marvel,"" because it is just that. As great and stunning as it may look, it is not so pleasant underneath. The story, writing, directing, and dialogue is just stale and cheesy. It started off strong and promising, but I quickly lost interest in the second act. Every 20 minutes, a new ridiculous plot point would be introduced out of left-field and I couldn't help but roll my eyes. I really wanted to love this movie, but admittedly was completely let down.Marvel should have ended with Avengers: Endgame. But unfortunately, the Marvel filmmaking business is now all about the money more than the entertainment. Consequently, the consumers are now to be given a revolving door of templated garbage."
6," Expected more from this film
",Reviewosaurus,/user/ur156806726/,20 February 2023,"Scott Lang, Hope Van Dyne, Hope's parents Janet and Hank, and Scott's daughter, Cassie, get stuck in the quantum realm and need to find a way out. Paul Rudd, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Jonathan Majors' excelled in their roles and were the highlights of the film. Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang really brought the character to life, but I felt how the character was written, was underwhelming for him to be the next big villain of the MCU. After leaving the cinema, I felt like this film didn't make any progress in the MCU; Ant-Man got through it without having a character arc, and I'm not fearing Kang like I did other villains of the MCU. I hope over time, the decisions of this film play out, and maybe this movie will get better as it ages."
9," So much better than the reviews
",tigerpride11,/user/ur57110255/,20 February 2023,Anyone trying to rate this within the Avengers movies is an idiot. Think Guardians. It's its own entity with lots of.humor and good action. Very good movie but I doubt it's gonna be a central character in future films. Overall great entertainment and fun. That is what movies are supposed to be.Its a very good continuation from part 2 and they get pulled back into the quantum verse. The new villian most likely will become a person of interest in future movies. Greta acting and adds a lot to the movie. Loved the new characters they introduce in quantumania and they add to the humor and humanity of the movie. Not sure why it's getting bad reviews but I thought it was great fun.
7," don't believe the bad reviews...
",64ctgst,/user/ur4172252/,19 February 2023,"My rating is more like 7.25 stars but IMDB doesn't give you an option to review movies that way.Look - was this a ""great"" movie - like 9 or 10 star movie - absolutely not. Is it a 1 - 6 star movie? No. If you're a fan of this genre, it falls into the 6.25 - 7.25 star range (which is ok - if you ask me). I don't think you're ever going to get the Marvel movies like Infinity War and Endgame ever again.Paul Rudd is doing a solid job with a semi-boring character. His Ant-Man (Scott Lang) is a regular guy - and there's stuff there with that... but not enough to be a 3 movie lead character in the Marvel franchise. I think the Hank Pym Ant-Man would have been MUCH more interesting. But anyway - Rudd is fine.I've seen reviews saying that there's ""no plot"" - well without giving away too much - they get sucked into the Quantum Realm (aka the Micro verse) - which is actually really cool - and need to get home. That's a pretty big plot! Then they get into what Janet van Dyne's time was like in her 30 years in the Quantum Realm. Then they encounter a version of Kang (the new Thanos of the Marvel Universe). ...and there's more but right there is a bunch of plot! They encounter some cool characters in the Quantum Realm (M. O. D. O. K., a great cameo by Bill Murray and Kang - who is not quite as intimidating as Thanos but is quite interesting and deep.The special effects were sometimes great, sometimes very average. The scale of the movie (no pun intended) is actually incredible - think James Cameron's Avatar. I think the special effects were solid considering the odd nature of the Quantum Realm.It's a solid movie. Could have been better in a bunch of ways (trimmed down the run time, some casting choices, slightly better special effects) but that's any movie. I don't love the recasting of Scott Lang's daughter but i loved how they reimagined M. O. D. O. K. I also don't exactly love Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet. Love Paul Rudd and Michael Douglas and LOVE Jonathan Majors as Kang."
4," Don't waste your money on this one
",galant-38340,/user/ur83800688/,19 February 2023,"The first movie is quite original and then it went downhills for each sequel.First the movie started off with a privileged girl with an attitude who think she is saving the world by spending her time protesting and then supposedly know how to create a machine (uneducated kid) that can send people to the quantum universe. She has never fought before and suddenly she is fighting monsters.The whole movie is a mess with the bad story lines and imitations of Star Wars. Nothing is original and they should just stop making anymore of the marvel movies, it's getting very bored and insulting.I gave it 4 stars instead of 1 because I like the older actors who is the one carrying out the show."
7," Kang is great. Everything else is ok.
",evansjoshyr,/user/ur64692948/,19 February 2023,"Quantimania is a strange a little movie. It tries to be an adventure movie, an Ant-Man movie and almost an avenger movie of sorts. There are far better adventure movies and the first Ant-Man has a more personal, funny and cute story. But it does succeed at being an entertaining watch in a couple of ways.Kang is the obvious highlight. Everyone knows it. The acting performance was amazing. He was intimidating and interesting. He was a scene stealer and is completely worth seeing the movie for. My only complaint is that the movie made him an Ant-Man level threat instead of an avenger level threat, which seems strange and unrealistic.Other strengths include good visuals, little bits of typical MCU humor (that don't undermine the kang threat imo) which occasionally made me smile and some enjoyable but basic character development between Ant-Man and his daughter.It's not the best or worst marvel movie. It's just a fine, standard superhero movie that happens to star the new large MCU villain. Can't wait to see more Kang."
7," Just for Fun. Some Opportunities Were Missed
",nemesis2000-2,/user/ur15496036/,19 February 2023,"The movie is what it is; just for fun. Quantumania is more comedy, drama, weighing more on comedy. Again the comedy hurts the weight of the story in this film as the intense story with the main villain needing more emphasis. The setup in some parts of the film did in fact heightened the gravity of the situation, but events that followed downplayed everything. Because of who the villain is they could of made him just as strong in the comics, but downplayed him like how they did with Gorr the God Butcher in Thor Love and Thunder.Is it entertaining? In my opinion, yes. Was it a spectacle/memorable? To a degree. There are some parts where you could tell writers were writing in filler material. Without that material the gravity of who the characters are remains the same. In my eyes Quantumania has a similar feel to some 90's films I grew up with that were there for fun."
1," WHAT IN THE QUANTUM JUST HAPPENED? DISASTERCLASS!
",samstersam,/user/ur162519182/,19 February 2023,"I swear a these god damn quantum ants need to get of my screen. Marvel let's it's self down once more. This was an acid trip of absolute quantum-nonsense. I can't express how angry the acting, the writing and the quantum ants made me. Someone needs to be fired and sent to the quantum realm because personally whoever is responsible for this should be out of my timeline.The shear amount of embarrassment that these actors must feel, I would be very surprised if they have the balls to go to another audition ever again.Although Kathryn Newton is very Quantum niceeeeee (if you catch my drift) so she's forgiven in my book."
1," boring and formulaic
",Riz11,/user/ur18299882/,19 February 2023,"It was a generic super hero movie, big bad guy we must beat up who wants destroy the world. No real back story on Kang, except he was exiled to quantum realm. Kang is supposedly extremely powerful, he has defeated thor and avengers in other multiverses yet gets defeated by large ants, then has a fist fight with ant man without the suit. The quantum realm wasnt really a factor or multiverse for that matter, it didn't really play any major role in the movie, besides multiple ant men piled together so ant man could reach the multiverse travel sphere. Attempts at humour were terrible, best part of the movie were scenes after the end credits with multiple kangs from different timelines and the loki scene where they show a scientist version of kang. So much could have been done with multiverses and quantum realm, yet this is just a brainless smash em up movie. Very disappointing."
5," Poor writing, logic problems, mediocre VFX + Artstyle
",sam-76092-82282,/user/ur162024468/,19 February 2023,"The story / script are the bones of a movie. It is the deepest you can go. In Ant-Man 3, the story is simple, predictable and you've seen it all before (think a shallow shadow of Star Wars OT), not to mention in some parts illogical such as Kang. He is meant to be powerful. He is not, unless in numbers apparently, which is a weak and disconnecting plot device.It is not a funny movie, I felt embarrassed in places - the humour was not weaved well with drama.The VFX feels worse than my first blender projects, with endlessly repeating objects, disgusting colours and is plain unimaginative. Not to mention the known poor treatment of artists. MODOK was awful and did not translate well, he ruined any drama. It went too far with it.The acting is fair, with Jonathan Majors outstanding, but the script must have been disagreeable to their mouths (especially that post credit scene).At the end, when Ant man was getting his head smashed I realised that was what I came for, it should have been a tragedy not a comedy, the raw power of Kang needed to be shown against such a lighthearted character. Alas, there was potential which was unused, Majors showed his prowess but needed more (or less) screentime. All I wanted to see during the movie was Kang and the pain from him on others, the horror. I think Cassie should have died (unfortunately)?Overall, disappointing and makes me anxious. It made me feel embarrassed & unhappy; what a movie makes the audience feel is most important, everyone should come out the cinema with the high of a giddy comic book nerd - they just watched a $200 million dollar live action comic book! Btw, the same writer is for Kang Dynasty, the next Avengers..."
5," Mediocre at best
",kshizj,/user/ur28794085/,19 February 2023,"If you remove the words ""quantum"" and ""time"" from the whole movie, it'll literally make no difference to the movie at all.It was almost like watching a rehashed version of jumanji except instead of going inside a game, the characters go inside the ""quantum realm"".I have noticed another couple of irritating things about the marvel movies.1. Why the hell is everything related to ""quantum"" stuff and the ""multiverse"" purple? Also, it feels like those repetitive slides on windows media player in early 2000s.2. I understand comedy is good, but its a lot more forced that it should be I think.Also, the actor playing Casey is pretty bad at acting."
7," Good MCU Film
",demonblade-37792,/user/ur140486858/,19 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is pretty good with its scenes, action, the story. The story has to do with the family of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hank (Micheal Douglas) all being sent to the quantum realm and want to go back home safe and sound. Although, they meet obstacles along the way of the civilization of the Quantum Realm, M. O. D. O. K (Machine only designed only for Killing), and Kang the Conqueror in the way. Ant-Man must do what is best for his family and fight whatever is in his way to go back home. Overall, I thought it was a good MCU film because I liked the acting and story. Some stuff that I did not like is that that the film is mainly dialogue and setup for the next MCU films coming up. It was not the best MCU film out of all of them or great, but it is good for a single viewing in theaters in my opinion."
8," Not the worst of the Ant-Man franchise and clesrly not the worts of the MCU
",SamC12,/user/ur63572280/,19 February 2023,"I get it. The movie was weird and certain ideas were not executed well (MODOK...)I get why phase 4 was less appreciated by fans. They are taking risks and they are not going with safe ideas.Quantumania was a good movie, with a compelling villain, good visuals, great characters and well made humor.My main problem with the movie is the many shifts in tone that are not always smooth. Kang brings a seriousness that is really well made, but in the process, you loose some of the charm that first Ant-Man gave us. Other than that, I would rank it in the same place as the first Ant-Man and, better than the second.Give it a chance!"
10," It was entertaining
",loveseason-63905,/user/ur161711802/,19 February 2023,"The first hour felt like a waste of time. Some things don't make sense like why did Cassie not tell about that machine to Janet this whole time? The main character didn't really feel like the main character. The visuals were ok i guess? I don't really care about the visuals but honestly the fight scenes were really amazing and i liked how much Scott cares about her daughter in this movie, even though her daughter doesn't care about herself and her dad. She just wants him to continue risking his and his family's lifes. Even though this movie wasn't a good Ant-Man movie, i think the preparation for Kang Dynasty and Cassie being in the young avengers team was good. Although i think this movie is kind of underrated as it is definetly better than every movie they released in 2022. I hope we see more Ant-Man in the future, better."

Naturally his mother in-law (Michelle Pfeiffer) held a secret that if only the daughter had known she wouldn't have been fiddling with this power.They end up in this adjacent/nearby/lesser/greater/alternative world, and adventures commence, father-daughter mend their relationship, and mother-in-law and father-in-law save the day, with giant mechanized ants, after the usual almost victory then setback then somewhat bigger victory then setback then triumph! And then some incomprehensible post-credit scenes.A poorly written sub-ordinary story you've seen in every movie since done the first time long ago, but mostly in Star Wars IV, V and VI.Bar scene with weirdo aliens? Check.Living squid-like creature as drink stirrer? Check.Jabba the Hutt type character but played without make-up by Bill Murray? Check.Dialogue as witty and creative as Star Wars I and II (which is to say it was neither witty nor creative)? Check.And a narrative that had all of the surprise of a remake of Cinderella? Check.Who writes this drivel? Where has the creativity gone? The only actor in this mess who was competent was Ms. Pfieffer.

3," I was so disappointed.
",klc-91300,/user/ur110250847/,19 February 2023,"I was looking forward to this. We were promised a new adventure and a new villain and this was supposed to kick it off. Well, I left the theater feeling really let down. I don't think there was one thing I enjoyed in this movie. First of all, it's 90% cgi. I absolutely pictured them in my mind while they were onscreen in bodysuits with those electrodes attached against a green screen, I could just see that instead of what was happening. The ""acting "" was dull and uninspiring. When I get to the end of a movie and can't remember much except there were people in it, you know it's boring. If they did recast the daughter role, they need to do it again. There's never a sense of danger throughout, especially dad and daughter scenes. Oh hey, let's have some snappy dialogue right before someone tries to kill us, and hey, let's happily hug and high five right after because we were so scared. I never felt one ounce of desperation or inspiration throughout, they were all phoning it in. And as far as introducing the new big, bad guy? What a letdown. I actually chuckled a little at the visuals of all of the versions of him breaking free because I felt no dread at all in thinking about where they were going or what they were going to do. It was a boring, cringy yawn fest that did not excite me for this next phase. They should have nabbed James Gunn to co-lead with Kevin Feige instead of letting him go to DC. I bet the next phase is going to be DC kicking Marvel's butt."

",assefawmiriam-80629,/user/ur162501474/,19 February 2023,"I have read a lot of comments saying this movie doesn't hit the way it's supposed to.For me Rudd's screen time felt limited for being the main character. Also, one of the reasons I love ant-man is because he is relatable and feels like a human who just happens to have powers. When you place him in an another dimension the entire movie, there is just nothing to relate to anymore. Everything is so outlandish that it just becomes ridiculous, but they are fighting for their lives so the tone they are setting is that it's supposed to be taken seriously. But the visual and storyline ends up feeling forced when they overdo it. Honestly, I think the actors saved this movie. This storyline could have become a lot worse."
4," Painfully Boring Multiverse Adventure
",tkdlifemagazine,/user/ur88886235/,19 February 2023,"There are elements of this movie that are fun and interesting-just not enough. Marvel's deep dive into the Multiverse has become common place and confusing and lacking in the essential elements that made these movies so much fun. This one involves a problem not coming from the exterior, but created within, and that makes it not as interesting or easy to care about. The characters are good. Paul Rudd is fun as the lead- he managed to strike the right balance always as a marginal superhero. Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, and Michelle Pfeiifer are very good. Jonathan Majors is terrific as the villain. Bill Murray has a quirky and fun role. The problem is that it is all not enough to save this one. I would wait till it hits Disney Plus and manage my expectations. Better than The Eternals, but worse than most."

Furthermore the soundtrack was great and it fits perfectly to the epic final battle... Finally the two post credit scenes were awesome especially the first one with the council of Kangs....

Now, I will give it this, Kang is really really good and I think Jonathan Majors did a phenomenal job with his character and I can't wait to see him again in the MCU. Also, visually, the movie looks great. It kinda reminds me of Star Wars mixed with Guardians of the Galaxy. With all of that being said, the story of the film is just so bland, and also the pacing is not that good. How is Cassie so smart at such a young age and able to build this communicator? Well, we never find out because we have to hurry to get into the quantum realm as quick as possible so we can get to Kang. Seriously, it took like 5 minutes to get there. Wasp did not even feel like a main character to me, and MODOK's death was just so lame it was laughable. That could have been the most unserious death scene I have ever seen. I felt like I was watching that death scene from Deadpool 2, but at least that scene has its reasons for being the way it was. I guarantee in about one week I will have forgotten pretty much anything about the movie because it's all pretty forgettable. The movie is not unwatchable, it just needed a lot of improvement."

I'm not sure what people are expecting with the Marvel films. At face value Antman 3 is a fantastic voyage to a realm barely explored. It has its lighter moments of humor that is expected from the Antman brand. It is also a departure from the San Francisco setting, for the most part, and throws us all in the deep end of the Quantum realm. It's visually fascinating and had me wanting to soak in as much as I could. I will not give anything away about the film, but please don't let any of these mediocre reviews persuade you from enjoying this movie."
5," Another disappointment
",tpcatoz-90650,/user/ur108369751/,19 February 2023,"When I saw all these negative reviews I thought people were just being pessimistic or just nit picking. Unfortunately, they were right. I wanted to like this movie and I was pretty excited going in. I didn't expect a life changing movie but I expected a solid marvel movie, the movies we got leading up to Endgame.Just like most of the other shows/movies to come out after Endgame, Antman 3 is underwhelming. For most of the movie it felt like the protagonists were just running around with everything blowing up around them. And all we heard about was how big and bad Kang was. Janet was petrified of him and said how advanced his technology was and how no one could even imagine it's power.We finally meet Kang and at first he seemed intimidating but at the end of the movie he is defeated by ants. Yes you read that correctly, he was defeated by giant ants. The man who is suppose to be bigger and badder than Thanos was defeated by Ants. The man who claimed multiple times that he killed Avengers before was defeated by insects.And at the climax of the movie when Scott says he doesn't have to win, Kang just has to lose, he destroys the portal back to earth by eliminating Kang with the core. Cassy yells out and it seems like Antman and Hope are stuck in the quantum realm. NOPE, 30 seconds later Cassy just builds another portal so Scott can return. It just takes away from Scott because he basically didn't sacrifice anything. He literally won against Kang.I'll stop there, but this movie is in the bottom tier of Marvel movies and was clearly made just to move along the Kang story. Kang doesn't appear to be anywhere near Thanos' level but I still have hope that Marvel can get their act together and make better movies and shows going forward. Or maybe that's just the nostalgia talking."
2," Bitterly disappointing waste of talent
",drakande,/user/ur154617393/,19 February 2023,"The Marvel train has delivered yet another weak effort with a very poor story. Almost every scene has a large plot hole. Nothing makes any sense of consistency and continuity. This is a significant deviation from the Loki storyline even though it is supposed to be the same storyline. The quantity world is just too weak to make a story out of so it's basically presented as a microbiology version. Big people above and the little people beneath. Which is ridiculous snd goes nowhere. The technology discrepancy is ridiculous. Kang is literally light years ahead. But they portray him in one breath as technologically superior, but when convenient, evenly matched. And then it's Star wars version 2, with ridiculous weak diverse species who's acting leaves much to be desired."

The acting was fine, but who really stood out was Michelle Pfieffer as Janet Van Dyne. Her, Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd are the true stars of this movie, as they should. The only problems with this movie is a lack of humour. Especially from Paul Rudd, who was lacking screen time in his own movie. But the thing that was so weird about this movie is that it reminded me of Star Wars, so many elements from Star Wars was used in this movie. Watch this movie if you just want to have a great time at the movie theatre. But don't read too much into it or expect for it to be a masterpiece."

The humor was so stale that the theater was silent almost the entire time any form of joke was made (attempted)
Plot was terrible and should've been used for another character that isn't AntMan. AntMans character isn't designed for anything heavily intertwined with plot, and he especially isn't someone to use when introducing MCU's new Villain. This movie seems like they just wanted to get AntMans movie out of the way because they had no idea what to do with him.There's no issues with the casting, however, the new writing makes it seem like they're taking two toys from opposing companies and trying to make it work.They also need to bring back Michael PeÃ±a - he stole both of the two movies ."

Kang it's played gracefully and powerfully by Majors who lends his imposing physique to the character.This film it's just a fun adventure with great writing that knows doesn't need to be a world changing event (not yet) but that needs to convey the dire consequences of its resolution.Go to the cinema to have fun and meet Kang, it'll all be okay.Also, the being with holes was hilarious."
2," The script and the direction of the movie isn't good
",raykg-570,/user/ur87808103/,19 February 2023,"If you go to theater just to see the new Supervillain Kang The Conqueror, then go watch it, its worth it. Definitely one of the best Villain they have ever shown other than Thanos. Even all the Actors did a really good job. BUT, other than that, the story, the characters, the pacing, the comedy/jokes, all of them are BAD.There was a scene where one guy got knocked out by the enemy but when his friend came to get him up, he is suddenly fine, and the most shocking thing is the ending, Kang The Conqueror is supposed to be the new Big Supervillain, but they just threw that idea out of the window and just beat him up with a lot of ants, YES, ANTS, not the main heroes. He was so powerful and badass when suddenly a lot of big ants swarming him and destroying his suit. I was like ""what? What was that?"". This movie is supposed to be introducing a new supervillain but they already killed him in his first movie, which making him less threatening. The script is just so bad. And apparently, the writer of this movie is also the writer of Avengers 5, which seems to be a red flag."

O. D. O. K , David Dastmalchian(The Suicide Squad,Dune Part 1) as Veb and Jonathan Majors (Loki, Devotion ) as Kang.I thought this was weaker than The Previous two Installments also it was great to see Paul Rudds Scott Lang get more serious lines of dialogue. Pfeiffers Janet Van Dyne and Majors Kang had the best performances of the film also it was great Kang had a larger role in his debut than Thanos in 2014's Guardians Of The Galaxy basically if Ronan and Thanos and his were flipped. Katy O'Brian had an underrated performance as Jentorra hope to see her in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. The weakest role and performance was Kathryn Newtons Cassie Lang/Stature also it was a disservice what they did to Emma Furhmann that shouldve been her role all i could think when watching it was that shouldve been Furhmann also did a terrible impersonation of Abby Ryder Forston as well though Marvel has recasted Unknowns in Prominet since then Xochitl Gomez, Iman Velani and Tenoch Huerta Meija since then Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.Amazing Score By Christophe Beck(Frozen II), Cinematography By Bill Pope(Alita: Battle Angel ) and Direction By Peyton Reed(Ant-Man And The Wasp) Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.

",lopresti-46927,/user/ur74523449/,19 February 2023,"The newest installment of ant man wasn't perfect but it had its good and its bad.Production value was great as it should be for a multi billion dollar franchise. But the vfx and editing was on point for sure.The characters good and the chemistry. They had an all star cast with Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, and Paul Rudd. Also, Johnathon Majors did a phenomenal job with Kane.The weakest part of the movie was the story. The first act was fine and moved along at a good pace but it slowed a lot in the second act. The third act was fun and action packed but the end fight didn't sit well with me. The dialogue was decent and quirky at times, but never cringe."
7," A Good End Of The Trilogy
",alindsayal,/user/ur147091341/,19 February 2023,"We have made it to the 31st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the start of Phase 5 Ant-Man & The Wasp Quantumania, I have watched it now and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Ant-Man, The Wasp & their family sent into The Quantum Realm, where they come face to face with Kang The Conqueror.Main Character
Paul Rudd is back as Scott Lang and I think once again he does a great job. He has plenty to do this time and his character has truly progressed since his first film. He is more confident as an Avenger and this shows in how he acts. His character has a clear progression and it is great to see Rudd deliver this really fun performance. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for The Wasp played by Evangeline Lily. The only reason I am putting her as a main character is because her name is in the title but she is given nothing to do in the film. Lily has shown that she can give development to Hope Van Dyne but she is really pushed to the side for other characters as that is a shame.Supporting Characters
The real star of the film for me though was Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror, Majors knocks it out of the park and provides a chilling and charismatic performance as this new antagonist. He has huge shoes to fill from Thanos and I was worried he would be saved for his future appearances but he is in this film a lot and he is given a chance to thrive and give a glimpse of what could be to come. Michael Pfeiffer plays Janet Van Dyne and she is given so much screen time here, we learn more about her time in the Quantum Realm and Pfeiffer does a great job in fleshing out this character that we have barely seen on screen. Kathryn Newton is the recast for Cassie Lang and she is a fun character here, the dynamic between her and Rudd is well realised and she is given plenty to do here which I mostly like. Michael Douglas is back as Hank Pym and despite having less to do, he is still enjoyable and still seems to have his passion for the character and the role.Story
The story was okay, my favourite parts were learning more about the backstory of Kang and what exactly Janet was up to during her time in The Quantum Realm. It was nice seeing some progression and development in Ant-Man from his actions in Endgame. But as I mentioned before, the film completely underuses Wasp and as a major character that is a big shame. Also, the final act makes some decisions that I am not sure works for what the audience are told in the film with way too much taking place.Script
The script was good. With it being an Ant-Man film there was plenty of humour here and the majority worked for me. It also had good drama and for the most part the two tones are separate and work well together.Style
The film is mostly set in The Quantum Realm and that means there is plenty of CGI here and for the most part it looks great. The visuals are very striking and colourful which makes it interesting and dynamic. The film is also paced pretty well, with the runtime feeling appropriate. But I felt like the action scenes could have been filmed better, there was a lot of shaky cam going on especially early on that made it hard to focus.Overall
Overall, Ant-Man and The Wasp is a good film that does an effective job of delivering an interesting film that sets up the future of The MCU. It probably fits in the middle in terms of quality of Ant-Man films but if you enjoy these films then it is worth a watch.Rating - 7/10."
8," F-ANT-astic!!! Movie only some minor issues.
",iamsini,/user/ur70136436/,19 February 2023,"This movie feels like it would've done phase 4 some good as opposed to being the kick off for phase 5, never-the-less I think it accomplished what it set out to do, if only at the slight cost of what we love about the antman movies which is only really accomplished by having this character interact with the real world. It keeps a good family dynamic alive while giving us one of the best villain introduction comparable to Thanos if not better seeing as we get the motivation from the start. Dope visuals and cgi but shaky in some parts. M. O. D. O. K was hilarious! Kang!!!! Overall this movie was awesome!"
8," 70s style sci-fi weirdness
",jharbert-47785,/user/ur155974843/,19 February 2023,"A lot of sci-fi these days worries about being grounded more in known science. Concerned with being picked apart by the internet and Neil deGrasse Tyson. I really enjoyed that Quatumania does more of that old school 70s style weirdness while still having things that hint at the science that inspired it. There are crazy creatures, landscapes and communities all over the place. It put me in the mind of something like 'Flash Gordon'(1980) and that's exactly what I've been hoping for from an Ant-man film.It's not Oscar bait, but it's fun with a cool world that they play in. The cast is entertaining and Johnathan Majors especially, is fantastic as Kang. The film does start to tie all the strings Marvel has been placing together. Which gives what is a popcorn flick a bit more weight.All in all, for me it was what I expected and hoped for.Note: there are two end credits scenes."
7," Johnathan Majors saves this film.
",cam7468,/user/ur33377801/,19 February 2023,"It is a lot to take in. I felt the story was rather lazy and predictable. For such a major event in the MCU, I felt it deserved more. However, this film is all about Kang and Johnathan Majors absolutely smashes this. One of the best performances from within the MCU in my opinion. Can't wait to see more of him. I felt the script let Cassie down, very cliche and cheesy moments when the film was trying to deliver serious points. I felt the humour in general was there however, which kept the tone from the previous Ant Man films.Unsurprisingly, there is a lot of CGI. This was expected, as near enough the entire film is set within the Quantum Realm. I think you have to embrace the wackiness, not critisize it. Overall, I feel it's a film or strong performances but a weak story - it's Johnathan Majors film."
2," Just plain bad.
",jason_kressen,/user/ur129419122/,19 February 2023,"I hardly leave reviews but this latest MCU flop was flat out just a waste of my money. I haven't seen a Marvel movie in a while and really only went to go take my nephews to see it. As most have said, Kang is only positive in this but he's not nearly enough to save the film.Writing was terrible, plat was incoherent, the jokes are just way too flat and the activist daughter, Cassie, is just insufferable. Of course Disney has to insert politics and also included an insanely awkward plug for Socialism towards the end. JUST STOP. Overall I don't see myself getting sucked back into the MCU again, if anything after seeing this I'm probably not spending another penny on seeing any these again, it's just not entertaining."
4," I love 40 minues of this movie the other 70 I do not
",harry-34518,/user/ur104275634/,19 February 2023,"Peyton Reed said that when creating this movie he wanted to make an avengers level movie. Well, he failed miserably. Too blinded by the direction that the movie needs to point the MCU in it gets lost in itself with a messy plot and uninspired mediocre direction. The movie was Sold in the trailers as a qauntum realm hiest for scott to try and complete for his rewards to more time with his daughter. Well i'd like to see that movie because this is not it. Instead we get a tiny hiest that lasts 5 minutes and an awful tory about a rebellion full of characters no one could care less about. Kang makes for an intresting villain and is one of the stronger mcu villians but he is ultimately undermined by the story, we keep getting told 'oh he's so evil' but we rarely get to see that side of him. But oh when we do it is this movie at it's best.The script has some very nice lines and floats out some nice ideas however, the script as a whole is just awful. It's either expostion or messy one liners or just Cassie saying 'dad' in a monotone voice with no facial expression. None of the characters have an arc none of them get any real development, there are hints of Scott having a possible arc but we never see it. Instead character development is erased in service of the plot, but the plot is so messy that it doesn't help. The movie lacks a general structure it feels like so much has happened, but nothing has happened. In addition by the time the movie ended i just struggled to see the point. If marvel wanted to spend a whole moive setting up Kang as the next big bad atleast have the story be good, atleast make us as the audience invested. Kang is meant to be our next big bad but not once did i fear for our heroes.The direction as a whole is a mixed bag Reed delivers some nice shots but overall there are alot of shots that are just awful. Some moments were so badly directed I couldn't tell what I was looking at and not in a good way. I know the qauntum real is difficult to pull off in live action but the CGI was so obvious at points that the movie felt like it was being directed by VFX artists. When you look at 2022's mcu movies despite their issues they all visually had something going for them, this does not. Furthermore, the movies action is lacking i can't think of any memorable action peices in the movie they're all over before they can even begin.The cast for the most part were brilliant especially Majors and Pfieffer. Newton is the weakest link in this cast but the script and direction don't do her any favours so I can't fully judge them.I did enjoy the opening of the movie and i thought it was nice just see Scott Lang being Scott Lang and seeing his life post avengers. Then when we fully got to see Kang introduced and have his first interactions with Scott I really love but after 20 minutes it all fell apart."
5," Good Ant-Man Movie, Bad Marvel Movie
",laroseparadis,/user/ur162507217/,19 February 2023,"I'll start with the first part of my title. As part of the Ant-Man trilogy, this was an okay movie. It had the humor of past Ant-Man movies and was in the style that the two previous movies were. It was fun, funny at some parts, and overall had kind of low stakes.However, I really don't think this movie advances the Multiverse Saga at all. This was the movie that was supposed to introduce the next ""big bad"" of the MCU - Kang the Conqueror. In the comics, Kang is known as one of the most evil, powerful villains. He's killed multiple variants of multiple Avengers, multiple times. In the film, he even asks Scott, ""Have I killed you before?"" There are many variants to Kang - Nathaniel Richards, He Who Remains, Rama-Tut, but Kang is supposed to be the worst of the worst. The other variants are supposed to be scared of him. In Loki, He Who Remains certainly was.With all of this in mind, I was actually really excited to see this movie. As the first project of Phase 5, I was ready to move out of the train wreck of Phase 4 and into something that would start to put all the pieces together. I was really excited to see Kang, and honestly, Kang was the best part of this movie. He was scary, evil, and I could definitely see why Marvel wanted to have him as the next main villain of the Multiverse Saga.I felt this movie really did the character an injustice. Kang is an incredible villain, who was defeated by a bunch of rag-tag Quantum people and ants. As someone who is supposed to be one of the most evil characters in all of Marvel comic history, this movie just felt like a funny way to kill a bad guy. It severely underpowered him and just completely took away his credibility as a powerful villain.In past movies, Scott Lang has never really been the typical superhero guy. He has a criminal past, he's still trying to figure the whole superhero thing out, and he's really just a dad trying to be the best he can be. I absolutely love Scott Lang and I think this movie really could have elevated his character. Let's be real - Ant-Man is there as comedic relief. This movie could've changed that. Marvel could have truly moved him to a hero who is desperate to save his family and will do anything it takes to make that happen.Quite honestly, I think this movie would have been way better if one, or all, of Scott's loved ones were either killed or taken by Kang. This is the problem with Marvel - they are not introducing high-enough stakes. As I mentioned earlier, Kang is supposed to be as evil as evil comes. Marvel could have shown this with deaths that would really impact Scott. Instead, they chose to keep it fun and light-hearted. That's not really who Kang is as a villain.Marvel was completely fine with introducing high stakes with Thanos. At the end of Infinity War, the good guys literally lost. That's what made both Infinity War and Endgame so good - you didn't know if the good guys were going to win or lose. The stakes got real, people died, and our heroes had to get really tough.Overall, I think Marvel missed the mark with this movie. I think this could have been a really cool introduction to Kang and Phase 5, and it would have gave more hope with the rest of the Multiverse Saga. I'm interested to see where Marvel goes from here, but I don't think it's looking good."
6," MCU Presents - Frozen Pizza For Dinner
",alex-88278,/user/ur82906877/,19 February 2023,"Ant Man and the wasp presents itself to the audience as the story-telling equivalent of a frozen tv dinner served at a the price of a high end meal (production costs be damned).Sure the ingredients are all there - a villain, a hero, a problem, and a quest, but despite getting your mashed potatoes, salisbury steak, and brownie square, you know that before you even take the first bite, the quality just doesnt exist.Quantumania's storyline seems fit for a disney + mini series more so than what will likely be the last solo film of Ant Man, and even that, must be shared with a sidekick.There's a laundry list of issues with this, so lets tackle all of them out of order, kind of like the plot and pacing of this actual film.The main problem with this type of duo driven approach is that 'buddy cop' duos must actually be duos. Nobody went to see Ant-Man for the wasp. Nobody cares about the Wasp.Batman and Robin are a good analogy of how the ""sidekick"" character is supportive and plays out.In Ant Man and ""the wasp"", the wasp gets equal (if not more) actual screen time and significance, while in the process, also neutering Ant Man's appeal, power, unique abilities, and connection to the audience. Paul Rudd is funny, lovable, down to earth as a middle aged dad turned super hero. The Wasp - Evangeline Lilly is flat in her acting, and lacks the depth of a main character, leaving the audience with no care as to her outcome or significance in the greater story.I wont even get into the subliminal messaging presented here, its all too modern Marvel/Disney and failing to even disguise itself. Man Bad. Woman Good. Man Past. Woman Future. That about sums up the messaging here. Why do we even need an Ant Man movie at this point? The Wasp, The Wasp's Mom, and Ant Man's Daughter are clearly of greater value to the MCU.That's also if we can even try to ignore the blatantly obvious, that all writing sacrifices were made in attempt to position Marvel's next ""big bad"", essentially wasting an entire movie to basically give us a few end credits with more significance than that of the plot of the entire film presented here.This felt like it was produced during the era immediately following the success of Star Wars, and while LucasFilm LTD's ILM was behind the special effects, there was certainly a lacking of Movie Magic, but no shortness of ""just like star wars did it"" scenery, creatures, and overall lack of originality.Many of us are feeling the MCU Fatigue. The writing is stale. We're tired of ignoring the fact that this whole story-telling strategy has begin to feel grossly formulaic. Quantumania fails the same way that Love and Thunder failed. 5+ years ago, heroes that didnt take themselves seriously and cracked jokes was an original idea. Now its the norm for all Super Heroes Marvel and DC.Save your money. Wait until it comes out on Disney +. This is the Marvel equivalent of a Straight to VHS. It will don the ranks of Black Widow, BP - Wakanda Forever, Love and Thunder, and The Eternals in it's unique ability to be so poorly written that entertaining anyone short of its media empire investors will be downright impossible.I wish I had one of ant man's shrinking disks, or one of Hank Pym's Ants, so that I could have witnessed the process of writing this story, and lived through how they possibly thought this could have been a good movie. Im struggling to understand and based on other moviegoers, that sentiment is not mine alone."
5," It's just basic colourful garbage
",makatron,/user/ur2418993/,19 February 2023,"Jonathan Majors was by far the best part of the movie and Kang felt like ran out of power for the sake of letting the good guys get the win at the end, also Michael Douglas was great as usual.Plotwise moves based on random stuff that for someone that already fought Thanos would know better, MODOK is wasted here bringing someone not even the writer of the first movie remembers. But yeah it is very colourful that would entertain kids for sure and for the amount of CGI this looks like it was made in a single chroma stage. It seems like the MCU went kaput with End Game. And indeed this movie felt like a carbon copy of previous MCU films."
7," Barely better than Love and Thunder
",valenzuelamichael,/user/ur61565870/,19 February 2023,"While I did enjoy the movie, it probably had more to do with the group I went with. We concurred that there was aspects of Tolkien and Lucas in this film. It was something that will require me to watch it over and over, on Disney+ to make sure I didn't anything. Kang will be a strong big bad throughout phase 5. I was hoping to see the fantastic four appear in the film. The comic relief was ok, the whole holes thing was a bit weird. I did like Cassie, she will be a good character in my opinion. Group didn't like the Janet story, a lot of silly stuff for sure. Bill Murray, they should have gone with an unknown, didn't feel like a role he would do. Bring on the Guardians!!!"
6," A Real Disappointment
",FinalSmash1689,/user/ur13848062/,19 February 2023,"PROS:
-All the actors are doing their best.-Kang has potential to be a great Avengers Villain.CONS:
-The story is all over the place and is bogged down by constant exposition.-There's so much CGI that my eyes glazed over.-The comedy is bland, I think I laughed once.-I don't think a single character had a defined arc.-The reshoots stick out like a sore thumb.Yeah, I really didn't care for this. Which is hilarious because I was one of the few people who enjoyed the last one. This didn't feel like the first two. This felt like 'generic marvel product number 81157"". The comedy is missing as is the charm. This just felt like actors espousing ridiculous exposition in front of a green screen. This didn't need to be an Ant-Man story. Marvel just wanted a movie to introduce their next big villain and, honestly, the whole thing feels hollow for it. Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas both felt sidelined, and Paul Rudd is just going through the motions. The reshoots are very noticeable. Even my wife felt that the ending was tacked on (because they just shot it a month ago). I think if they had stuck with the original tone and kept the original ending, this might have made for a better experience. As it is, it's a disappointment."
6," Huge miss! Why is it so dark?
",t_money_8,/user/ur29015196/,19 February 2023,"I get a tad anxious writing reviews for the MCU films. As I know a lot of my friends and acquaintances that read these reviews are big fans of the franchise. Which, in full transparency, I'm a huge fan as well. Now, with all that out of the way ... Sorry to report, Quantumania was sort of a mess. Two hours of CGI nonsense that I'm still trying to process.I'm going to break my thoughts up into categories. Graphics + lighting, acting, and plot.Graphics + lighting: The entire movie was dark and I don't mean in tone. I mean it was literally so dark, that I couldn't see a damn thing. So many action scenes that were meant to be impactful, fell flat due to the scene being so dark. It seemed like the director put a bad filter on the movie to cover up bad CGI. As for the graphics they were pretty good most of the time, but a few times I had to laugh at how poor some of them were. I know visual effects studios are struggling right now with labor shortages and crunch, but man come on with these graphics! Yikers! I'm talking about M. O. D. O. K - more to come on that clown.Acting: I'm happy to report that Paul Rudd is still extremely charming and is legit the only reason anyone really cares about Ant-Man. Actor Jonathan Majors as Kane is so freaking good that it makes me mad he is in this. That's back to back MCU movies where I think the villains of the films are wasted! (I'm referring to Christian Bale from the last Thor film) The rest of the cast is utter trash! No spoilers I guess, but a character named M. O. D. O. K might have single-handedly ruined the entire movie for me. It's some of the worst CGI I've seen in a modern film and his dialogue is mind numbing how poor it is written. Micheal Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Evangeline Lilly are all so forgettable.Plot: Quantumania takes off right where the last film ended. You'll wanna brush up before watching. (In particular, the Loki series on Disney+) The story line is pretty straight forward. Stop bad guy from doing bad thing. But somehow the writers did a fantastic job of muddling the story and left me wanting more. A lot of unbelievable things happening just because they said so... no real rhyme or reason. You are literally, not figuratively dropped into another world and not given any rules for what anything is and why. (I've got so many questions on the Quantum Realm- Do you age differently? How can they breath? Is it space? Why is it so dark?)In the end, I'm not sure I would recommend the movie to be seen in a theater. I will say, at times it felt like a strange Star Wars sequel. Few times, scenes felt ripped straight out of a New Hope- the Cantina scene in particular. So if that floats your boat I found that to be sorta rad. But just wait until it comes to Disney+ in a few months and get caught up then. No need to rush out and see this.That is all ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤™ðŸ�»"
7," Overall, I enjoyed this
",mrsford-43996,/user/ur162504732/,19 February 2023,"Overall I enjoyed the film, the plot was well written and executed and introduced Kang (this particular variant) well. I feel you wouldn't truly 'get it' unless you had watch Loki, so people who aren't Marvel mega fans may be confused, leading to the low scores. It remains to be seen (see what I did there) if this Kang was the lesser of many evils, which will be interesting to explore in the future movies. I have marked it down as I wasn't completely convinced by Cassies interaction with Scott, not sure why. We had lots of shots of her looking wide eyed but something was missing from the character built up until now. Also the 1st quarter did have an 'Star Wars Attack of the Clones/Jar Jar Binks' vibe. The Modark twist was cute!"
5," Should not have been an Ant Man movie...
",melonhulkhead,/user/ur155924234/,19 February 2023,"Going into this movie I wasn't initially expecting much. I thought it would simply be a fun little adventure with solid comedy and enough action to please a 2 hour watch time. And yet I was somehow drastically disappointed.First of all I didn't completely hate this movie evident from me giving it a 5/10. So to get all of the good out of the way:Kang was amazing and basically every scene he was in was just really entertaining and were increasingly intense as the film continuedThere were a couple of good action scenes at the end of the movieI was really pleased with how relevant Janet was and she actually had a really good conflict with other charactersSome of the comedy I was actually very good so it wasn't completely unfunnyThe cgi was surprisingly ok with the scenery looking well detailed and colourfulAnd unfortunately that's about it. I would go into detail but I don't want to spoil much people can still enjoy this movie. So now that the good is out of the way let's get into everything else.To start with anything I'll just quickly mention that the script was so uninspired and dull. It was honestly hard to tell if the script was bad or the acting cause so much of the dialogue just sounded unrealistic.Another point is the comedy. Some of it was quite funny and made me chuckle but nowhere near the quality of the first movie and even the second. Alot of this fell flat also just because of the bad script.I honestly disliked most of the characters which is not saying much since there are only like 7 who actually do anything. Hank felt like a massive missed opportunity especially due to the lack of screen time or focus on his character. Cassie had a decent start but they provided us with little reason to relate and become attached to her. The secondary villain (who I won't state the name since they did not show up in much advertisement) became a full on joke outside of their introduction which was actually really cool. But what's worse is Hope. I don't have a massive issue with her character but that's because she barely did anything in a movie that's literally named after her??? I think she had even less dialogue than Hank. It just felt like a massive waste since i actually liked her in the previous movies.I'm sorry but this should not have been an Ant Man movie. The previous films were much more grounded and that was respected and made sense. But this movie just felt too massive for Ant Man to be playing a significant role in. It's great that we got to see what was going on in the quantum realm but I just wish they used other characters for a plot like this.The action was a mixed bag cause whilst I would say that the final act had some interesting and cool fight scenes, the rest of the movie falls flat and provided few fight scenes which were actually impressive or engaging. Even in the third act many of the fights were awkwardly split up in order to fit everything else going on. It felt as if they spent more time making cool cgi scenery rather than choreographing or developing well thought out and simply ""cool"" fights. They just felt underwhelming.A small nitpick but the music was so boring and cliche compared to the other entries. The main Ant Man theme is amazing and has become an iconic piece of music for that specific character yet it barely shows up in this movie and when it does it just randomly stops to play some inconsistent pieces of music.And that's about it. It consisted of a few impressive scenes and fights aswell as impressively introducing the main big bad for the upcoming MCU movies. However, it drastically reduced its rating with an underwhelming first and second act, sub par comedy and characters who were either wasted or treated as a joke. 5/10 but honestly close to a 4/10."
7," Decent, but not enough to get you pumped for Phase 5
",ta-98251,/user/ur147286305/,19 February 2023,"The Ant-Man series was appealing because it was a small scale Superhero movie which allowed Marvel focus on a fun, personable and acceptably comedic story.Quantumania steps away from this as it serves as the major introduction of Kang the Conqueror on the big screen. This has a positive and negative impact on the film.Kang is easily the best part of the film. He is played excellently by Jonathan Majors and for the most part, has a great on screen presence. He's by far the most menacing villain we've seen in the Ant-Man series and pretty much carries the film alongside Ant-Man.We also get to explore the Quantum realm which looks unique when compared to most other marvel properties. There was a lot about it that felt like Star Wars. For the most part the CGI in the Quantum realm looked really good but one of the sub villains is by far the worst CGI character Marvel has ever created. It was legitimately off putting.There was also a lot of exposition to try and fill us in on what happened off screen to tie the Ant-Fam and Kang worlds together. It felt like I was listening to an audio book and the explanations weren't always well thought out. Not to mention, we get another Marvel child genius pop out of nowhere.Quantumania was an average entry into the MCU. It's not as bad as some critics have suggested but not enough to get you really excited for Phase 5. Whilst the scale of the movie increased it did manage to keep some of the charm and wit that has made the series enjoyable although it wasn't as well placed in this movie."
7," A Decent Fun Movie
",stevemajor-75327,/user/ur162270851/,19 February 2023,"""Ant-man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" was a decent movie. If you like Marvel movies you'll probably like this one.Jonathan Majors was the shining star of Movie. He gives just a perfect tease of what could be possible in the future with Kang.Kathryn Newton did a great job of playing a younger hero that just wants to be respected.Paul Rudd was his normal funny charming self.Visually this movie looked amazing. They did a great job of making the Quantum realm look alien, but in a good way.Now for a big negative, the interaction between Evangeline Lilly and Michelle Pfeiffer just seemed to stop the movie in its tracks. Gone are the happy go lucky, so glad your back feelings and now there is almost a bitterness because Janet is reserved about talking about her experiences in the Quantum realm.Aside from a couple jokes they really wasted M. O. D. O. K he could have been so much more in a different project."
5," Time to start saving money, wait for Disney plus release
",anujchoutala,/user/ur67286878/,19 February 2023,"The writing in this movie is terrible. The actors have tried their best to do justice to their storylines especially Michelle Pfiffer and Jonathan Majors but even they couldn't stop this movie from being eternally bad. Some good bits come from MODOK and some very visual world building effects but even they were shoddy in some parts. After end game, quality of Marvel films have definitely gone down (barring NWH and Shang Chi) and they aren't doing anything to rectify it. If this remains the case then I guess we should just wait for these Marvel outings release on Disney plus and save our bucks."
7," Enjoyable
",BirdzOfParadise,/user/ur17095564/,19 February 2023,"Let's start with the con, the story. It could have and should have been so much more. They had a great idea, but the writers seemingly lacked the creativity and depth to really take this to its potential. I'm beginning to believe my comic book fan brother who for years has said the MCU is geared toward children as these last two phases for sure just don't seem to tackle their stories with any depth or coherency to them.But the pros...Jonathan Majors not only landed this role but delivered more than I had expected. With different writing I feel even he could have been more but with what he had to work with, he gave us so much...definitely one of the best performances in the MCU. I like this Cassie better than the Endgame Cassie, Altho I hate how the latter learned she wouldn't be returning. And the ants are unsung heroes of this franchise once again.All in all, it was an enjoyable film, worth seeing for sure."
8," A Great start to Phase 5
",Jimduffy-51410,/user/ur153917511/,19 February 2023,"Going into this movie theme trailers looked awesome and it was the first time we would the actual Kang since the variant we saw in Loki Season 1. The main positives here are that's it's incredibly fun Paul Rudd is a charming and comedic as ever it has a great family dynamic here and love how much the films are starting to feel like the comics. But the best thing about film is Jonathan Majors as Kang, every time he's on screen your listening and you know he's a threat everyone is serious and they've done a great job of setting him up for future films and tv. I know some people don't like that this Ant Man film more of an avengers level threat and they prefer the more fun heist feel but Ant Man 2 Lost it for me. Other than Modok being pretty dumb ass and cutting some tension I had a lot of fun with this one but I do wish someone died as we are dealing with Kang the Conqueror!!!. Overall 84%"
8," Better than expected
",leesbrooks-73219,/user/ur65322062/,19 February 2023,I totally get marvel fatigue but I've always liked the antman films . This didn't disappoint me. Without the overdoing of the MCU I think this would have better reviews. Maybe when the slow the output there will more appetite.There was plenty of action and not to much humour which has been an issue for some . I think it sets up more to come well. However if youd never watched any previous films you'd be totally confused on what was going on .Still I think this film has been unfairly slated especially when looking at phase 4 content such as miss marvel which was dull as dishwater or eternals.

Kang was a great villian and the action scenes were done well. Some of it was a little out there but that's the nature of diving in to the quantum realm.While I like Paul Rudd as an actor Ant man have never been my favorite story lines. Going into this movie knowing that I was trying to look at the big picture and wasn't disappointed. It's like Thor, the series was never great if you take it for what it is you won't be disappointed. I left excited for what is to come which I think has always been Marvels best feature. Leaving viewers wanting more."

",its_me_rajit,/user/ur47608563/,19 February 2023,"Dear Marvel,
you have to admit yourselve that like the music has its peak note and its crescendoes you have already hit the peak note in ""Avengers"". From now on taking the same heroes ""Antman"" in this case whatever villains you will try to create are seen very dull,I have seen this before, or O not again (facepalm) because the viewers are comparing it automatically to ""Thanos"". Nothing can be more interesting than ""thanos"" and his backstories. Here also story has suffered the same.Do the Paul rodd has wittiness as scott lang ? Yes he has , are the jokes landing properly ? Most of them are . But to create the superhero movie they are not enough.because of this it seems o again similar kind of marvel movie.You can see powepacked performers again binded together Major as a major villain, Douglas and for brief bill murray as well. The story is okay, However I would have loved if the antagonist development was carefully done may be 2 to 3 stories to make him ,break him and then recreate him. After all ""There is always a room to grow!""
A big ""Thanos"" Fan."
," One Time Watch
",manojtanwar99,/user/ur58114059/,19 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania serves as a one-time watch that marks the introduction of Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Although it may not be on the same level as blockbuster hits like Avengers: Endgame, the film is still worth watching for Marvel fans who want to keep up with the ongoing storylines and events within the MCU.The film provides an entertaining and fun-filled experience for viewers with its unique mix of action, humor, and science fiction. The chemistry between the lead actors, Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, is one of the highlights of the film, and the addition of new characters like Kang the Conqueror adds to the excitement.However, while the film is enjoyable and provides some thrilling moments, it may not be the best of the Marvel films. The plotline can be predictable, and some of the action sequences may feel repetitive for viewers who have already seen the previous films in the series.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a good film, but it may not be the best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's a one-time watch that provides an entertaining experience and serves as an introduction to the next phase of the Marvel Universe."
6," Not as bad as the early reviews
",dave_maguire,/user/ur45782531/,19 February 2023,"So I'd seen articles saying that hits film had received the lowest score for a marvel film, but was sure this couldn't be correct - after all, we've all seen Love and Thunder haven't we!So I went in with an open mind and upon finishing the film I was left with an unsure feeling about the film. Ant man is great character and I've enjoyed his films and appearances so far in the MCU, and all of these have been quite lighthearted, which makes me feel that the more I think about it, the more I feel that he is the wrong character to introduce the ""new big bad"" into the MCU. Don't get me wrong, given the setting I'm not sure who else could, but the tone of the film is more serious as a result of it, which doesn't seem to fit an Ant man film.It not without its good points of course, Paul Rudd is.... Paul Rudd, and that's never a bad things and he plays the plays the part great yet again, and some of the supporting cast are good also, Michael Douglas was bearable for a change, and I found Evangeline Lily to once again okay the Wasp well. Thee were some some action scenes in it and I found the CGI landscapes seemed to be visually stunning in places, and even though it maybe wasn't all great, to say this film was largely based on green screen, overall it was good.Unfortunately the film was let down by a few things, pacing being one of them as it is all over the place, which causes this to film to drag...a lot, especially in the middle section. There are also a few plot holes and issues that let the film down also. Many surrounding Janet:1. We were told she was alone in the quantum realm, yet she evidently spent years in there fighting a maniacal tyrant..... this never came up in conversation when she was home? Even when they decide to farm quantum particles at the end of the last ant man? Heads up might've been nice for Scott?2. If you're helping Cassie (who is apparently now also a technical genius???) build a machine to study the realm, maybe point out the dangers of it before she does something like this - don't tell her it's an empty realm then have a go at her for building it.3. When you're IN the realm and your family find out something is going on - tell them! None of this ""trust me"" ""there is no time"" crap!Also, I was under the impression, and could be wrong out this, that the suit protected the wearing when shrinking/enlarging, so I'm unsure why Scott and Cassie can take their helmets off, mid battle also, and it not affect them?Unfortunately for me, the main issues were the villains. M. O. D. O. K was never going to be an easy villain to show in live action - unfortunately some characters don't transfer well from page to screen, such as Galactus, so he was never going to look great, but it was the portrayal of him what was more annoying as, despite being feared as a hunter by the locals, he was purely played for laughs through the whole film. He was done better in the Avengers game! But for me the worst one was Kang! I guess the credits scenes show this character was somewhat of a red herring regarding being the ""next Thanos threat"", but this guy couldn't even lace his boots! At no point did we get any indication of his power or threat level, and gets beat rather easily by a regular human man who ""talks to ants"". I honestly expected some of the main cast to be killed in order to put across the threat level but no, everyone is fine - no trouble! Even after Scott and Hope seemingly get trapped in the quantum realm - oh hang on, let me just turn the machine back on... sorted!Also, the whole mulitiverse Kang situation doesn't entirely make much sense to me - so ""He who remains"" was worried of what would come if he got killed, which we all assume was this Kang we saw, who advises that he needs to get out of the realm and warned of what would happen if he didn't, but now he got killed, all the other variants, who banished him for trying to kill them all, decide now that Humans have killed him, they should kill the humans??? Huh?? What?? It really makes no sense?! To me, Kang would be better served just being the antagonist in the Loki series instead.So as always, it's sometimes easier to point out negatives than positives so it probably sounds like I hate this film, it's not perfect, but it's better than some of the more recent efforts."
6," An average quality movie
",gafej10,/user/ur142169048/,19 February 2023,"It was visually fascinating, i loved the places and species they were really cool.The story quality was average at most. You could predict everything that will happen. There were a lot of inconsistencies in the film (like when in the end they were going home, but if Kand attack even a second later, the team would be at home already and Kang would get the powersource, so he could escape from the quantum realm), and lots of thing were not explained enough in depth.Molok's redemption was horrible - A girl said to him, that don't be evil, and he ""oh yeah why haven't a tought of that yet, i will be good then ...""
The other thing that was horrible the super intelligent 2000 year old ant civilization, like wtf?!All in all it was and average movie like all marvel movie after endgame. It is good for one night to watch, but nothing more."

",Muhammad29,/user/ur136426413/,19 February 2023,"This is the biggest of the ""Ant-Man"" films, but if you think about it, the story arc of Scott evolved to the point where he deserved something really big on his own. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential. In that light, Quantumania is stellar! Great story, and flawless execution, makes this one the most epic ride since Endgame. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing. The film doesn't have the nerve to wipe the smile off the audience's face like in ""Infinity War"" but still, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a fun ride that both long-time fans and casual viewers will enjoy. The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is really creative! One of the best villains so far in the MCU and this movie makes me incredibly excited to see where they take his character. Just remember to always look out for the little guy."
4," Weak plot
",raisummer-47789,/user/ur162219339/,19 February 2023,"With all the brilliant VFX, poor story line killed the energy of this Marvel movie. Antman movies used to be funny but this one is dry and some laughs are forced. Character development is so common, so weak. One character hiding facts from others when infact that's the first thing they should do to clear the air. Fighting sequences weren't good either, nothing much to see. Cassie daughter of antman was the most irritating character in this movie, only there to scream dad..dad..and mess up. Acting of the main villain was too forced with those facial expressions. They should have done better with Kang. The only thing worthy enough were the costume concept of some and the wiggly run of red blob."
3," What did i just watch?
",atarradah,/user/ur69960227/,19 February 2023,I am a fan if the mcu so when this launched i rushed to watch it. For me it was disappointing and childish. It is a mix of star wars meets antman meets childsplay. The storyline has no depth its goes from nothing into a 2 minute conversation to action. I felt like i was watching a blooper reel and that at anytime someone who burst out laughing in some scenes. It seems marvel is on its way down and the only line they have is spiderman as all others have flopped or are flopping in my book. This was a long awaited film and i am sorely dissapointed at the result. It does seem like the movie was just rushed out the door like a cashcow.
8," Welcome to a New Dynasty
",GomezAddams666,/user/ur59148101/,19 February 2023,"Let me start by saying that I truly loved this movie, many have said it overuses CGI, but the way I see it this movie called for it given it takes place in the Quantum Realm, not to mention the CGI is fantastic.The cast is great as always. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly have great chemistry, and I did enjoy how malevolent Jonathan Mayors plays Kang, but he also gives him a hint of Royalty with his demeanor. The story is also great, outside of Hawkeye this is one of the most lighthearted stories post Avengers: Endgame, which is okay. But the real stand-out of the movie is Cassie Lang.I think Kathryn Newton is a great addition to the MCU, her portrayal of Cassie is flawless, she portrays her both very badass and emotional.This is a great movie to kick start Phase V, I can't wait to see what comes next."
4," The worst thing a movie can be at the theater is boring
",trumstheconquero,/user/ur160952838/,19 February 2023,"This film qualifies. The Antman and Wasp effects are handled routinely now so the superhero aspects aren't significant. The film has several quiet scenes of dialogue that are so drama and action free (no music either) they put you to sleep.The best part of this movie is the end credits visual effects along with the theme score. It prepares you for the action film that never happened. In my mind I was thinking of how the film utterly failed to deliver. I don't want to say this because I like most of the cast and parts of the first two movies but, this movie was bad and wastes an opportunity to entertain. It also wasted an opportunity to introduce Jonathan Majors part to a wider audience in an effective way. The way this movie utilized the end title sequences was bad in this exact regard."
7," Wouldnt call it rotten, but it could be better.
",mr_bickle_the_pickle,/user/ur17527919/,19 February 2023,"I definitely dont think its as bad as the critics are making it out to be. I wouldnt say its rotten. But its definitely not a top favourite of mine either. Im not sure where I would rank it out of the whole MCU, but in terms of the other Ant-Man films, I still like the first one the best, and Id probably put this above the second one. My biggest gripe with this movie is the ending. Without giving too much away, I wish it had mirrored what Janet had done earlier during a flashback. And I didnt feel it was a satisfying end for Kang. I felt like it took him a peg down on being a badass villain. Which is a shame because I think Jonathan Majors was great in the role. Also, I wouldnt say the CGI is bad but there were a number of moments where it really looked like a bunch of actors standing in front of a green screen. Which I guess is a problem when 95% of your movie takes place in an entirely CGI world. So it kind of took me out a bit as I wasnt fully immersed as I should be. Although CGI wise I think M. O. D. O. K could have looked better. I know hes a weird looking guy to begin with. But it was definitely very uncanny valley in a bad way. Now I dont care that the last Cassie actor got replaced....but I dont think Kathryn Newton was a good replacement. I just didnt feel like she matched the previous Cassie's and I didnt feel like she had a lot of chemistry with the rest of the cast. And my other gripe, for a movie called Ant-Man and the Wasp you'd think they would both be the main characters but Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) didnt have a lot to do in this movie. I mean she also spends a good chunk of the movie separated from Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Unless the title refers to Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) because she definitely plays a more important role in the film.All that being said though, I had fun with the film. It still has some of that silly Ant-Man humour. I loved the beginning and ending framing device with the voice-over. But the film also has plenty of serious moments that work too. Even though I griped about the ending, I liked where it was heading. Kang just absolutely brutalizing Ant-Man was great. I think the Quantum Realm and getting to explore a different realm was fun and interesting (although a lot of -production and costume wise) did remind me of Star Wars. And I loved the family dynamics in the movie.I rated the film a 7, but I would say its probably more of a 7.5 for me."

Is this any propoganda to degrade marvel studios common guys every movie need not to be an endgame level . It neither lacks story nor visuals , its apt and definitely acts as a stepping stone to build the kang dynasty...when compared with the other ant-man movies it's grandeur enough.....coming to the post credits you will not be surprised but definitely like it as continuation always gives us happiness and finally, expect less enjoy more...."

Kang is a highly dangerous villain and Jonathan Majors kills it in this role. I look forward to seeing him in the upcoming Loki season 2.M. O. D. O. K is another villain featured in this film and whilst he is a quirky addition to this film, he is a fun one. His highly dangerous weaponry and deadly presence is only brought to light for his first few minutes of his screentime and then his presence starts to feel less threatening.This film doesn't focus too much on itself and instead focuses on setting up future MCU projects.Overall, a solid start to Marvel's Phase 5."

The jokes hit home and had me chuckling on numerous occasions but weren't forced like in love and thunder. I think the end could have been improved with the reveal of the big danger.

But I really hate the power scaling. One time Kang is depicted as someone who conquers universes and wipes out avengers and another time a group of ants are enough to destroy his suit.I think this Kang has the potential to be a better villian than Thanos in terms of motivation. His motivations have actual moral dilemmas. With Thanos, you could just break his entire ideology with ""double the resources"". Here, Kang is the most logically sound person and his way makes the most sense.It was a shame that they killed this Kang, atleast supposedly. I really hope they're able to continue with the moral dilemma presented in this movie. Only reason I'm not giving this movie a higher score is because of the power scaling.

The stakes are so high, the scale is much larger that the previous two films, and yet nothing happens.The movie is almost entirely filmed against a green screen and it's painfully obvious in every scene. For every scenery meant to awe you with it's otherworldly visuals, you get the feeling that the actors were just looking at ping pong balls. Speaking of the visuals, the film looks like every other instalment of the franchise, with uninspiring cinematography, limited camera angles, and cgi ranging from bad to mediocre. One character looks like the egg from the Puss in boots movie.Jonathan Majors' acting is the only thing the movie has going for it, but his character, like any other, lacks in any sort of good writing.Having now watched three antman movies I get the feeling that every cool shot and idea of the first one was made by Edgar Wright."

All the acting was good no complaints, I thought Jonathon Majors stood out as the best .What I didn't likeA story has to have a begining a middle and an end. They don't have to be presented in that order, but they do all have to connect.This film connected them very very badly.Almost as if somebody said ""I loved Starwars and all the desert people and the jawas, can we do that?""
""Yes sure"", they answered ""we can just say they have been zipped to a multi-underverse, through an inter galatic wormhole by a falangee, the audience will love it""So there were long scenes that were clearly inspired (to be nice) or more accurately a 'rip off' of star wars - That was the first 'Jar' assuming we swallowed the glib convenient way our heroes arrive in 'star wars desert scene'. Hundreds of 'ant men' reminded me of the Matrix and the agents - another 'borrowed' idea?Bill Murray appears as Lord something or other - that had not the slightest relevance to anything. The scene could be deleted and you wouldn't noticeThereafter it's just a mish mash of scenes. There is no real story for the audience to invest in.That I think is the problem. This is not a story, it's just a slide show of 'cool scenes' which individually don't tell a story, or tell it badly and boringly.I literrally was watching the film and waiting for it to end. 5/10Would I watch it again ? Absolutely not.This film should be despatched, back to the multi-underverse of low quality mediocrity from whence it came, as quickly as possible.Not worth the price of a cinema ticket."

They were setting the tone of story and we don't even know what happened to them after previous movie. It's hard to believe that the director is the same person who made two prior movies. Adding Kang definitely made this into Kang movie that have Ant-Man in it."

",skmujahid-06214,/user/ur162218711/,19 February 2023,"Marvel need to be more quality and quantity in their films because we can't satisfied by movies like Avengers endgame , Spiderman no way home ...etc they are a such a greatest films ever in Marvel cinematic universe they need to be continue like phase 1 saga because audience wants Good CGI in Marvel movies but Marvel focus on story only they need to be focus also all sides of movie I noticed when see this phase 5 first movie ant man and wasp qutamania I think that Marvel CGI graphics didn't good such films like eternals and black widow and please marvel need to be more runtime in their movies we noticed that from last phase 4 movies low runtime that's which is marvel need to be also understand and finally conclusion words good CGI Good story Good and also good runtime so please understand MARVEL Thank YOU."
8," Star wars + classic movie about marvel
",voitovychyan,/user/ur162489522/,19 February 2023,"I liked this movie because of the special effects. The movie ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantum Mania"" is a classic movie about a superhero and people who rebelled against a dictator. There is also humor in this movie. I laughed at some of the moments. I think it's a good start to Phase Five, but it's not the best Marvel movie.This movie is similar to Star Wars, and in general the whole universe that was shown in the movie is very good. I want a lot of movies about this quantum world.I really like the final battle. The people who made this movie did their best.My rating is 8/10 because the movie has a very banal plot. But the director revealed some characters, which is very good.I also liked the thief in the movie, because this thief did everything honestly."
10," One of my favorite Marvel movies
",andrewwelsh-99979,/user/ur102555231/,19 February 2023,"Kang is a force to be reckoned with. His story and introduction is very intriguing. I actually enjoyed MODOK and what they did with his character. People are bashing him about his looks but he's supposed to be weird and funny looking. I thought the cgi was pretty good compared to other recent mcu entires. This movie is very fun to watch, lots of people were laughing in the theater with me, but that didn't take away from its emotional tones. This move had some serious steaks and had restored my faith in Marvel again. I got some Star Wars vibes, specifically episode 9 but executed very well. Paul Rudd was brilliant as always and Ant-Man's suit in this movie was particularly cool, just looks wise, it's my favorite. And post credit scenes have got me curious on what the mcu has in store next. Highlights: Paul Rudd's hilarious as always but with some serious and good action scenes, Kang is just awesome, the quantum realm has never felt cooler than this, so much to see. Don't listen to critics and ratings, watch it for yourself and form your own opinion. My local theater gave out free posters that i immediately hung in my room, and the back had the poster for Guardians 3 which I can flip over to when that comes out. With his good this movie was (in my opinion) I'm excited for May 5th."
8," My opinions on this movie
",tobybrent-10353,/user/ur162488698/,19 February 2023,"I just watched Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania in the cinema a couple of hours ago, so I believe this is the best time to write a review.I want to start by talking about the story, I know it wasn't to the level as some people were hoping, but I thought it was great and definitely doesn't deserve it's rating. I'm not here to say everyone else is wrong though. I feel everyone's opinion is valid but I believe people had their expectations too high, especially since people haven't been loving the previous titles in the MCU. I was wondering however how Scott brought up how ""time works different in the quantum realm"" but we never really heard anything about how long they were gone for, there were some other things not great with the story but nothing that's makes it a ""bad movie""Next is the acting, I thought Michael Douglas' performance was amazing and Paul Rudd was great, I even enjoyed Michelle Pfeiffer's performance, I have heard people saying Cassie's actress was great, I didn't dislike her but I don't believe it to be on the same level as some of the others actors in the movie. Nothing against her actress though. The scene where Hank comes with all the ants to fight Kang may have been a little over the top but it legitimately made me laugh and I thought it was great acting.Kang was great too, I enjoyed the end credit scenes although to be fair I think they made us wait too long for the second one, this movie kind of just made me more excited for Loki season 2, I having a feeling I'm going to love that because of Kang in this movie.To sum up, I enjoyed the story, the acting and the experience, any problems with the CGI, I understand but you have to remember 2 words,She and Hulk, and yeah Modok looked ridiculous but I believe that was apart of what made him a cool character. I do hope people enjoy the movie in the future and don't let people like me influence your choices on if you like it or not."
8," Fun, but not great.
",PaytonMArnett,/user/ur162006125/,19 February 2023,"The first Ant-Man film was great, the second film was somewhat forgettable, and I feel this one will fall in line with the second one. The pacing and tone where off, Scott Lang got a lot of screen time, but the rest of the cast got comparatively little. The choice to tie MODOK into the first fill felt forced and strange. Paul Rudd was certainly the star, and was made the film worth watching. KANG was an entertaining villain, but didn't seem to belong in an Ant-Man film. The first Ant-Man worked so well because of its smaller scale, the large scale and shorter runtime did not work in this film's favor. The MCU is growing stale, but this shows I can still have a good time at the movies."
9," Doesn't deserve the hate
",madelyntax,/user/ur126481740/,19 February 2023,"As a longtime mcu fan (both movies & comics), I absolutely loved this movie. It absolutely doesn't deserve all the hate. Aside from some gross dialogue at the start, the story line and tension was there throughout. Genuinely had me at the edge of my seat. Jonathan Majors CRUSHED it once again, not surprised. Fun cameos. So many pure ""Ant-Man"" type moments and humor. Love Paul Rudd.Watch it. One of the best phase 4 movies yet in my opinion.Also! It has two great end credit scenes. Offers a lot to the franchise going forward. I can't wait to see Kang back at it in the upcoming avengers movies."
6," Fun, but not the shift it's marketed as
",fraser-simons,/user/ur37365377/,19 February 2023,"This movie was really weird, and some of the ways it was weird worked, and some really, really didn't. The art direction and cgi was inspired though, making it, at least a spectacle to consume. The tonal shifts and comedic timing were more miss than hit, the stakes never really feel real. It actually feels basically all but completely unnecessary and is extremely predictable along the way.If the movie didn't have this weird alien aesthetic that works, it would have probably flopped, for me. The marketing makes it seem like an action packed, quite serious, but family almost travelogue - but it's basically just lots of weird stuff with dumb gags and jokes. I think had they stuck to what it purported to be in the trailers it would have actually worked a lot better, though not by any means at all heavy on theme."
10," 10 to help it, 7.5 actual
",brandezhernandez18,/user/ur27559101/,19 February 2023,"Listen, if you're a marvel fan, you'll love it. I think people went in expecting this to be an Avengers 4.5 the way ads have been portraying it (you're not in the wrong for expecting that) but this movie is its own thing. Was I expecting a big movie? Yes, but an Ant-Man big movie. Being a huge fan of the previous films, I knew I would love this film regardless as the director stayed the same. Even if it was the worst of the 3 (which I don't think it is) it still would be an enjoyable, fun ride. Do not listen to the critics, give this film a shot for yourself and I guarantee you will not be disappointed. Thank you."
8," I love it lots of bad reviews
",kaefab,/user/ur26030604/,19 February 2023,"I love it lots of bad reviews, to be honest its a lot better than ant-man and the wasp the second movie.From the start of the movie you laugh, they are all funny, the effects are top notch but that is to be expected from a marvel MCU movie.I did not know who Khan the conqueror was before watching this movie but he is pretty cool too as a bad guy.Also the quantum world is really well done, how to understand the language and more great ideas.Not sure what people want more from this movie its had everything, seeing Michelle Pfeiffer back on the big screen was great, also Micheal Douglas as Hank is also good.Very good movie to see on the big screen for sure and a great addition to the MCU universe i am ready for Guardian of the galaxy 3 now."
7," A few moments weren't needed
",radaaleksieva,/user/ur132238181/,19 February 2023,"Actually quite interesting.It looked a lot like Star Wars, Avatar and Monsters University because of all the creatures.This Daren thing I didn't understand it could've been done without that head. And the moment with the citrus. I mean run slowly and then say I'm hungry - did we actually have to see this?I think this is a really important film to have watched before the new Avengers.And the movie is connected to Loki - just a little bit.Not as strong as Wakanda Forever but a lot better than Thor: Love and Thunder.Again a lot of multiverse stuff, timelines and time travel.And i don't think it's that connected to the second film."
3," A hero is only as interesting as his villain
",ErnieonthecouchRecords,/user/ur159760056/,19 February 2023,"And Kang is and incredibly interesting villain, but not here.We never know his motivations, we never know his backstory or his goals. Hell, we don't even see Kang the CONQUEROR conquering anything.We don't see his back story, sure they tell us, but film is supposed to be a visual medium. Remember how you felt about Thanos in Infinity War? That's how you should've felt with Kang and we didn't.The high stakes are never clear, there's a lot of spectacle and millions of dollars in CGI and it all falls flat.This movie has a lot to show us but shows us nothing. There's a revolution here. Ok, but we're not gonna show you that. There's a lot of potentially interesting characters, ok, but we're not gonna show you that.We have the Ant-Man family kicking ass! But we're gonna show you just a little of that.Who wrote this stuff? I'm betting there's a lot of nepotism going on at Marvel Studios. ""Just put give him a chance, he's 20 now and he had a Spider-Man pajama when he was 10. Surely that makes him qualified.""Marvel used to at least have something interesting in their movies, something to say. Of even buried a bit beneath the surface. This one? This one doesn't even have Michael Pena.No soul, no writing just millions of dollars in VFX that don't even look that good.And-Man 3 is the Avatar of the Marvel movies and the worst of the 3.It's even worse than Ironman 3."
5," This movie sucks
",ColinTheGorilla,/user/ur150398104/,19 February 2023,This movie is beyond frustrating and boring to watch. It had so much potential and absolutely failed as it was beyond boring and stupid. The only positive I have for this movie is Jonathan Majors as Kang as he made this movie actually somewhat enjoyable and he killed his role. Other than Jonathan Majors there's nothing else good about this movie to be honest. It was so boring and marvel keeps getting worse and worse everytime. I'm sad that this movie flopped for me and absolutely failed and was beyond weak. Overall this movie is pretty boring and dumb. Kang is the only good part of the movie and overall this movie is trash.
2," Star Wars Prequels Meets Horton Hears a Who
",CallMeGrainne,/user/ur123638604/,19 February 2023,"This movie was ambitious...I guess? I'm sure glad it was only two hours. The first few minutes were alright, but it went downhill FAST. The storytelling was lazy, the plot was cliche, and all the characters (excluding those you have to see in several previous projects to understand), are underdeveloped.Though the world-building had its okay moments, I was rather disappointed, especially after other movies like Avatar and LOTR have paved the way for creativity to prevail in this category. The effects reminded me of the Star Wars prequels in the worst way, as did the dialogue, but we'll get to that later. Many of the character designs were also reminiscent of Star Wars; others were outlandish and ridiculous. (Broccoli guy anyone?) And Darren?! Poor guy looks like he just stepped off the set of Spy Kids. That was too awkward to be even ironically funny. And the fact that all of this is happening on a miniscule scale reminded me only of Horton Hears a Who rather than anything remotely scientific. Imagine a world where there's another tiny world inside of it! Dr. Seuss already did.The dialogue was bad. Just bad. Maybe an AI read all previous Marvel scripts and came up with this, and no one made any edits. Just a thought. Several lines of dialogue seemed desperate to become a meme. Jokes are littered throughout, which made for an awkward movie-going experience, because very few people laughed.The soundtrack was probably good, but not memorable. There were a lot of horns used, like John Williams would have done. Unfortunately, John Williams walked so this film could crawl.I hate to say it, but this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I've tried to make myself give it more credit, but I can't. It gets two stars because it got me to brush off my writing skills to write this review and because Paul Rudd is a delight."
5," This is a movie for 12 and under audiences only.
",BeastyBoyFlicks,/user/ur25493637/,19 February 2023,"This movie starts with a flashback scene, that should have been a 20-30min flashback that allows the audience to get to know Janet and Kang more intimately, allow us to ""feel"" more for the characters, as well as, deeply understand what 30 years in the Quantum Realm was like. I felt nothing for any character in this movie. The movie had no balance between humor and drama. Composed music was pretty lacking. However, anytime Kang was in a scene, the way he spoke and the tone of the scene felt really good. So disappointed in Marvel and the cast for allowing this movie to be made the way it was. Horrible writing."
10," Way too much hate, this is amazing
",BornLosePBPA,/user/ur11419635/,19 February 2023,"As an avid comic book fanboy this is everything I was looking for in a Marvel movie. If I look back at what I had loved about the first two movies it was most likely the comedy aspect.This movie makes the comic nerd in me happy and I died laughing throughout. Modok wasn't spot on with the comics, but they made him just as ridiculous. There's honestly not much more I could ask for. It's an adventure and if you hate on this, you don't like fun.Easily a 10/10 for me for good reason. I was laughing my ass off and absolutely thrilled by the storyline. What's not to love?Please go see this, it's worth it."
5," Ugh.. not good
",wesfarnsworth,/user/ur162485045/,19 February 2023,"Let me start by saying I loved Ant-Man 1 and 2 and I was really excited for this movie. Unfortunately this movie was a huge let down for me and the others I saw it with. It was quite boring and didn't feel like Ant-Man at all. Kang is a cool villain but the story wasn't very good. Lots of cheesy dialog.. Modok was painful to watch, the design could have been so much better. I was most excited when it came to an end. It's not a movie I would care to watch again.. Ever.. The mid and end credit scenes weren't a surprise, I think we all knew what was coming next. There were a few funny parts outside the quantum realm but thats about it. Baskin Robbins even got old.. Also, where was Luis?"
3," Not great, at all
",jonkelley-81636,/user/ur89301345/,19 February 2023,"This movie does a lot of things wrong but I feel like it's showing how the new disney is just fighting itself now. The movie starts okay with a lil Paul Rudd narration, it quickly goes down hill when we meet Cassie Lang, and realize that his daughter has turned into a pretentious, virtue signaling, privelged, and ungrateful criminal. Then the movie bad mouths Ant-Man as he has become a guy who just saved the world but hasn't been doing his due diligence to help the most marginalized of society. We then learn about the quantum realm and the character Janet starts to take over as the annoying hero who could just explain the situation to everyone but instead says ""Trust Me"", ""There's no time"", and other classic cliches of this annoying archetype. Ant-Man and the Wasp (Title Characters) take a back seat to Cassie and Janet as they go on their own Rick and Morty rip off of an adventure. Cassie and Scott are captured by a group of characters who we are supposed to grow attached to but since we only have about 5 minutes to try and do that while learning very little about any of them, they more just become side characters that aren't given much purpose. Janets story has a good Bill Murray cameo, Hank and the Wasp might as well not have been there as they contributed nothing. The best part about this movie is Kang, the all powerful time traveler still has a very disappointing part in this movie but he starts strong although he ends quite weak. Kang and Modok are probably tied when it comes to building up a powerful character who does nothing meaningful with that power at all. After hearing Kangs backstory and meeting him we understand that he is the new Thanos. We also find out MODOK (Iconic Marvel Villain) is just Yellowjacket (Darren) from the first Ant-Man and instead of making him the super weapon with a giant brain that he is supposed to be he becomes the ridiculous character that is hard to look at or take seriously at all.Now I feel the need to say that the deal they had from Kang is that if they let him leave he wouldn't mess with their earth, but of course they refuse because movie, and put their earth in danger from a near omnipotent Time god, because Cassie and Janet care so much about the marginalized quantum realm. The movie goes on to have many dull fights and conflicts that leads to one of the most odd moments in the film where the near all powerful Kang waits in his tower while they overwhelm his guards and MODOK, who doesn't use any of his vast amounts of weapons and powers, for no reason. Then when it's very late Kang comes out and kills a character no one grew to love even though the movie makes it seem like we should have, and when Ant-Man and crew come to fight him he pulls his punches, or else the fight would've been like 5 seconds long with Kang killing all of them, and loses... to ant-man...and a bunch of 1,000 year old socialist ants. This is where the movie completely just dies to me, Kang is supposed to be the new big guy and we see him get beat in his first film appearance? By Ant-Man? Imagine if Thanos would've used Ronan as a Modok character in the first Guardians and lost to the Gaurdians in his first appearance, because that's basically what they've done here. This movie reaffirmed me in my decision to stop watching marvel post endgame, I've not seen like the 7 marvel movies most people point out when talking about the worst marvel movies (Thor 2, Thor 4, Captain Marvel, Eternals, ETC.) but I can tell you that this is without a doubt the worst marvel movie I have seen. I give it a 3/10, the 3 good things being, Bill Murray, Kang, and Greg Turkington, and an honorable mention to the little bit of Paul Rudd humor we get."
10," It's an eight but had to level the field!!!
",ferforeman,/user/ur49536656/,19 February 2023,"What wrong with you people and what are you looking at....this was very enjoyable and is a perfect addition to the marvel franchise..it was funny,dramatic and so much adventure like the title said QUANTUMANIA it took you there...i dont know what you critics want in a movie but if you dont like this one then keep watching re-runs of the old marvel movies but dont spoil it for the next man. If you are reading this review you are skeptical about the bad reviews and you should be im not going to give anything up about the movie. Because as one critic said it was all over the place...trust me it wasnt it was just right for a sequel."
10," Awesome performance from Paul Rudd with some amazing actors thrown in.
",saimariejohnson,/user/ur45036497/,19 February 2023,"Our entire family really enjoyed this movie. Paul Rudd did a tremendous job with this and the addition of Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer were perfect elements to make it hilarious, thrilling, and heartwarming all at the same time. I think this is the perfect family movie with so many great dialogue moments and epic action scenes. We were all pleased with this movie-going event and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.Michael Douglas' character was probably the best in my opinion though I did really like the element of him with Michelle Pfeiffer the way they played off each other was perfectly executed."
6," Terrible Cassie and Janet
",notagrodriguez,/user/ur74529195/,19 February 2023,Kathryn Newton and Michelle Pfeiffer's acting single handily ruined this movie for me. Just terrible. Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd were phenomenal. Fun scenes here and there but it could have been better with decent supporting actors. So many jokes fell flat. You can tell when someone is trying to be funny and they're not. When I was in school those kids got bullied. I am not condoning bullying but I think Marvel needs it. They've surrounded themselves in an echo chamber where they feel they can't do wrong. They need to fire screenwriters who are tone deaf to what the audience wants. You can't run away from terrible reviews forever. They need to be put in place where they start losing money and start listening to the general audience.
7," Planet CGI but fun and good villain
",rcuttill,/user/ur1930549/,19 February 2023,"We go down into the quantum world and enter planet cgi. Apart from the actors everything is CGI. There are strange creatures and landscapes. There are people who for the most part are similar to human, body, 2 arms, 2 legs etc. But with various different heads. There's no exposition of where everything came from so it's just the quantum realm and you have to accept it. It's kind of true for a lot of films these days but it's just such a surprise which makes it noticeable.The plot is acceptable and the villain is great. He's definitely menacing. They're so confident of him they say he'll be back.So enjoy. Ant-man and the wasp will win but they left a let out for a sequel."
6," Ant-Man Episode III: Revenge of the Scott
",thesar-2,/user/ur17825945/,19 February 2023,"Awww, that's cute Disney. You ruined Star Wars, so instead of losing another billion on a new chapter, you disguised a MCU movie into an unofficial ""Episode X...Size Does Matter.""Actually, this is literally Star Wars, Star Trek for the villain and a Marvel movie all combined into one. Heck, one character was totally using the Force.I'm uncertain the reason I rated this higher than the previous two Ant-Mans (which I thought were just okay, but enjoyable) is because my expectations were INCREDIBLY low. To the point, I thought I was going to hate this. Though, yes, it definitely has its issues. Comedy, or the lack thereof, was one.For a series that thrives on comedy, mostly from Paul Rudd and definitely Michael PeÃ±a, this one had so many jokes, but only 1/3 worked. I didn't hate the jokes; they just were mostly DOA. And I have NEVER known the great Bill Murray to be this incredibly unfunny. Well, to be fair, he wasn't funny in Charlie's Angels (2000) and Ghostbusters (2016.) Here he served his purpose and couldn't be less Bill Murray.What also didn't help was the lack of Michael PeÃ±a. He had thee very best scene of the Original Ant-Man and every other character in this third movie tried to take his place annnnd failed. I mean, again, I laughed a few times. Just cringed at the lack of thought they put in most of the ""humor.""The movie doesn't waste any time getting the family that talks to ants together shot into the Quantum Realm. Trapped and separated, the group tries to reunite and go back home, only to run into a pretty good villain, Kang, hellbent on joining them to seek massive revenge.I did like this entry. Especially if you view it through Star Wars Eyes. It's just a fun romp with excellent acting and wonderful screentime from Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror. Heck, Michael Douglas was also fun to see on screen - I'll never tire of seeing him.The only ones I thought were meh, but serviceable were Ant-Man, himself, Paul Rudd who seriously didn't seem like his heart was into this, Evangeline Lilly as Plain Jane Wasp and the annoying, zero-personality daughter played by Kathryn Newton.Also, a few of the creatures were pretty fun and unique. Well, except BIG HEAD. That design was just incredibly awful. Mimicked a ""live action"" Humpty Dumpty with a human head in place of the egg. Looked disgusting, cheap and completely out of place even in this Realm of weird and exotic creatures.DEFINTIELY leave your brain at the door and don't ask too many questions. It's at the same level as Black Adam (except with WAY better FX) and Thor: Love and Thunder. If you liked those superhero movies, you'll most likely have a good time here.***Final Thoughts: I was warned I absolutely need to see the final two end-credit scenes. Eh, sure I guess they're important in this ""Phase 5"" MCU period, but they were nothing special."
7," A little bit of a lot of things.
",rengezou,/user/ur36739531/,19 February 2023,"The movie is fine.And may be spoiler alert.Not perfect, just an acceptable level I assume. It combines many popular movies' fragments. For example, a little bit of ant man itself, a little bit of Star Wars, a little bit of strange world, and a little bit of dune. I think what happens here is the team trying to grasp all the significant spectacular parts of each classic movie, but it didn't go well. So it does acquire some de ja vu of these movies. The scene in the quantarium is mixed with the strange world and Star Wars and dune, a lot of weird living things. Kang's army is just like some copy paste first order style from Star Wars. But lack of wow factor, it doesn't work out like what we saw earlier in avatar 2, or even the scene in Dune, it's not spectacular and broad and beauty, it just ""okay"". Just from a visual perspective. It doesn't bring the shock like black panther 1 when the movie showed us how waganda looks like.The story is also "" yea..."". I'll say it is quite often when the main character grew up and audience doesn't like them anymore."
6," Not as good as the other two. But not all bad.
",SPZMaxinema,/user/ur132395489/,19 February 2023,"Negatives: No Michael PeÃ±a/Luis (in a freaking Ant Man movie which he's always in), ridiculous scenes and dialogue that seemed to be written by children (I trusted you, you gave your word when he didn't know Kang at all, etc), MODOK and how dumb he was/looked and his character's lines (he did not need to be in the movie), and then playing the pronoun game earlier in the movie way too much and how they kept saying ""him, he"" etc talking about Kang just to build tension which got annoying at a certain point.Positives: Kang was a cool and powerful villain and Jonathan Majors acted very well and I can't wait to see him in Creed 3, Paul Rudd did well as Scott Lang as always and his humor worked, and the world building and effects/green screen looked really good and it was creative what they did with the quantum realm.Overall it wasn't a bad movie, the story was good but it had parts that made me cringe pretty hard. I'd much rather rewatch the first one or second one (which are more original and funnier)."
6," Stop Already
",dmerette,/user/ur62384953/,19 February 2023,"I didnt hate this movie since Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas were really good and made it worth the watch. Paul Rudd ruins it IMO and I can hardly stand him and will never understand why they chose him to play a super hero in the first place. I loved the world building in this movie. The wife, Evaneline Lilly? Has no business playing Michelle Pfeiffers daughter, she looked the same age or just a few years younger. Who cast Michelle Pfeiffer as the mother? She looked great IMO and was just awesome. I'm truly tired of these Marvel movies, but since not much else is being made, and I thought this one would be interesting, I went to see it. Its better than nothing, so I gave it 6 stars. The actor playing the bad guy was great too."

",johnjamespollard,/user/ur60089931/,19 February 2023,"I thought this was really well done and the criticisms of the CGI are generally unwarranted. I went into it thinking it was going to be terrible due to negative reviews but was pleasantly surprised to find out they were wrong. This was a pretty great movie overall with lots of action and spectacle. MODOK was intentionally goofy looking but was actually a fun character and an important part of the plot. Was it the best marvel movie ever? No, but it was really enjoyable and quite intense at times. Star Wars vibes? Absolutely, but also a cool exploration into the quantum realm. Definitely not disappointing. I will probably watch it again when it comes to Disney +"

",jrae1122-172-735374,/user/ur56779700/,19 February 2023,"I consider myself a pretty mild Marvel fan. I watch the movies with, I would say, a slightly above-average knowledge of the Marvel Universe. I listen to the critics, I watch opinions on YouTube from those who critique movies, I watch the breakdowns from platforms like New Rockstars, ScreenCrush, Heavy Spoilers, etc and although I went in thinking I was going to be disappointed, I enjoyed the movie. Jonathan Majors was fantastic as Kang and I can't wait to see him show up and cause havoc everywhere in more movies. He is the right kind of evil and NO Ant-Man didn't kill him like so many are saying, he got blown back and sucked into a quantum hole. Scott knew at the end Kang would be back. We all do....
In my theater people were laughing at the right times and were truly invested throughout the whole thing. I'll tell you the only thing I didn't like was sitting through the end credits for the extra scene. THAT could have been a TV commercial.The movie was good and I think you should watch it.ğŸ™‚"

",nickclarkturner,/user/ur162482215/,19 February 2023,"Excited for the future of the MCU. Have been hyped for this movie ever since learning it would be a continuation of Kang's character established in the great show Loki. Was concerned about the negative reviews going into this but I have no idea what their problem was. It was 100% an Ant Man movie continuing the story of the previous 2, expanding on it in a way that was interesting, entertaining, and hilarious. Obviously the stakes have gotten higher than the previous installments but it did a great balance of comedy, drama, and action further establishing Kang as a worthy MCU Phase 4-6 villain. Can't wait for the next season of Loki and any other installment that is going to add to this narrative, especially when done as masterfully as this."

",rotten-potatoes,/user/ur92159142/,19 February 2023,"I wish Disney and dc studios could have a baby. Because then we'd have a serious movie with a light mood.But antman 3 had an appropriate amount of Jokes. The cgi at times was wonderful, the world they created was pretty cool at times. They brung in new characters that complimented the movie and didn't detract or seem agenda driven. The villain was at least as good as ultron avengers 2, if not better. Was a nice surprise they saved for viewers also, which was one of the best parts in my opinion.Really my only gripe was the character that was included to gain the young audience. That basically ruined it for me. The whole family vibe is corny as it is, but the ""young"" youthful character arc just didn't fit. Maybe the directors thought the previous antman films needed the ""young"" arc not sure. But as a 42 year old man I just wanna see some good old comic book interpretation without the Hollywood machine using its influence for commercial purposes."
2," I'm So Done With Marvel
",Owen_Watches_Everything,/user/ur162106551/,19 February 2023,"The MCU used to be something I would get excited about. While obviously not artistic masterpieces, the MCU used to be fun popcorn entertainment that would be a good way to take your family to the theater and be entertained by charming characters and fun action sequences. Now, it's a pale shadow of what it used to be and seems to only get butts in seats based on brand recognition alone.Pretty much everything I hated about phase 4 is on full display here. The writing is juvenile, the visual effects are atrocious, the humor is obnoxious, the ""emotional"" scenes don't work and all of the characters are hollow and uninteresting. Although I did enjoy the post credits scene and a couple of moments scattered throughout the film, I was begging for this one to just end as it is 2 hours long yet it felt like 4 hours.I'm so sick and tired of this franchise that I really want it to die. After Guardians 3, I might be tapping out completely."
4," Complete flop of Marvel
",kumar_delish,/user/ur39933308/,19 February 2023,Most Marvel fans reviewing it's a great movie in MCU and we'll made but actually it's a failure.Weak story line always making mistakes and getting stuck in quantam relem is that actually lot of people had guns and rebel in quantam size? FictionI feel sleepy while watching the movie in first'half more conversation.Visual are not that much stunning some CGI work gone bad but of we can't compare this samll movie to Avengers end game.Some detailing in story is missing.Some how it's a ok MCU movie not more than one time watchable.I love antman part one very much but part 2 little disappointed but ok now and totally disappointed in the movie.Boring and disappointed MCU.
8," Star Wars meets Fantastic Voyage...Sort of, but good!!
",professordj,/user/ur157124771/,19 February 2023,"Sometimes a movie over sells itself with all the previews and such so that your expectations are based on what you thought you would see. The first 30 minutes therefore thrilled me with its humor and unfolding plotline ... Heck ... Even character development. Then, right in the middle of an MCU movie I found myself , well, feeling like I somehow landed in the middle of a Star Wars movie, cosplay, sets and all. This wasn't bad, maybe it was me, after all didn't Top Gun Maverick blatantly get away with ' blasting a mountain away' like they were destroying the Death Star ... Again! But, the Star Wars parallels kept on going all the way up to Kang and his Imperial Army. What finally got things right was how Kang was played by Jonathan Majors which, thank goodness, broke through as a true MCU villain. He was and truly is a worthy opponent to the Avengers and it is an extremely hard role to play. Not a pimp, or stree thug, but a complex presence in the Marvel Pantheon. This movie was hard to do in that it had the Loki storyline to expose at some time while introducing this particular 'he whose name is not to be spoken'. Threrin lay the rub: this had to be a cog movie, and NOT A PLATEAU OR PEAK! THERE'S MORE TO COME! GOOD STEPPING STONE MOVIE!!"

Everything is excellent, the script is excellent, the director, screenwriter, producers, composer, visual effects specialists, all the actors and the rest of the film and studio team did great!!! Quantum Realm is beautiful, fascinating, the study of this world is magnificent, I would like to stay there longer, immersion in IMAX 3D is incredible, the perfect beginning of the 5th phase, I can't wait for us to see and learn more what it will all lead to. All the actors played perfectly. Cassie, played by Kathryn Newton, perfectly fit into the ant-family!!! The antagonist in the person of Kang the Conqueror, as well as Jonathan Majors, who played him, were very impressed, this is really the next level, I really look forward to seeing more!!! I really love this movie and want to watch it again and again, I adore all these actors and the characters they play, I hope we will see them again as soon as possible! For me, this is one of the best MCU movies!!! Thanks to everyone who worked on this wonderful project!!!"
3," They did it again
",nscoby93,/user/ur39717569/,19 February 2023,"With every new Marvel release seems to come with it a new reason to question if Marvel even knows what they're doing anymore.Ten plus years of good Marvel movies, since the opening of the MCU with Iron Man in 2008 we have been gifted with great entertainment, good writing, and great characters, played by great actors. Now... and now... just look at yourself Marvel, what have you become?I genuinely still want to believe Marvel can return to what made Phases 1 through 3 so good but every new film just kills that hope a little everytime.Now Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, this film is the definition of a mixed bag. I wanted this movie to be good and I wanted to love it and I definitely wanted all the low scores and bad reviews to be wrong this is just not the case.So what is wrong with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania? Well short answer everything. From poor writing, to cringe dialogue, terrible cgi (which seems to be Marvel's forte now) to absolute piss poor pacing, terrible structure, and no coherent thought anywhere and that's just the first hour of the film.However this atrocity is somewhat saved all thanks to Kang The Conqueror who is played magnificently by Johnathan Majors. For the first time in this entire mess of Phase 4 or now 5 whatever the hell Phase this is, we are treated to a truly menacing, terrifying, ruthless villain who can rival Thanos. He is a true threat and the best villain since Thanos but unfortunately even he is lead to a letdown by the end. Which is the second biggest problem with this film, at soo many moments this film can be better than what it is but the writer is complicit to just keep writing trash! Trash jokes, trash lines, trash everything!The entire first hour of this film is like watching a headless chicken running around, there is no structure as we jump from scene to scene with some of the worst background cgi. If it had nothing to do with Kang I did not care. He literally carried this film on his back.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania as I said with Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is why writing for a TV show and a major motion picture are two very different things. Why would you hire a writer who has only done some TV stuff and some episodes of Rick and Morty?But the biggest problem from this film is that it suffers a identity crisis, trying soo hard to do soo much and to be soo many different things. Trying to make the Quantum world beautiful and equal to Avatar's Pandora, a story and Sci-Fi epic equal to that of Star Wars, and somewhere trying to be a Marvel film all at the same time.I just keep asking what's the problem Marvel/Disney, is it money? Well that can't be it because you threw 200 million dollars at this. Do you simply not care anymore? Or maybe you keep hiring writers who DO NOT care about these characters and where they come from. I've read very little of the Marvel comics in my life and I have more respect for the source material than these writers seem to have.Anyway, I'm just disappointed and rather heartbroken at how Ant-Man is treated here. You were one of my last hopes Ant-Man and now it seems its all up to James Gunn and the Guardians of the Galaxy, perhaps they can become the Guardians of the MCU we will see.Ant-Man you had a good run but you have unfortunately gone the way of Love and Thunder and Multiverse of Madness. He was the smallest hero but was also the biggest... literally biggest because he could grow to like 80 something feet, you at least had two good movies.IMDb: 3/10

10," The ""Lydia Tar critics"" didn't like it, so I loved it
",Victor_daSilva_,/user/ur128061108/,19 February 2023,"By far, the Ant-Man sub-franchise is my favorite in the MCU. I identify a lot with the hero, as I am the son of a divorced father who struggles to pay child support, and I guarantee that if the opportunity arose for him to be a superhero, he would definitely take it, just like Scott Lang.Quantumania, the third installment of this trilogy (which, according to rumors, could become a quadrilogy), is an honest film with its proposal (sci-fi comedy), unlike anything that came before in the story of the ant hero, which previously brought espionage, action and comedy (okay, comedy is a constant). Kang, the villain from the Multiverse Saga officially introduced here (not counting He Who Remains in Loki), is a much better opponent than his predecessors, Yellow Jacket and Ghost (not counting that bad guy Sonny and Cassie's stepdad), and the issues he brings to the characters are incredible. Initially, in December 2020, when it was announced that Kang the Conqueror would be the villain of this story, I was very worried, because at first I thought of the character walking confused through the streets of San Francisco and just being a generic villain... but I was surprised, not least because at the time we didn't know that Kang would be Marvel's ""new Thanos"". Kang and Quantum Realm bring a range of novelties to the story, which, even simple, attracts and keeps the viewer entertained.This is not a film made only by the post-credits scenes, like Black Widow, or just another hero movie that was successful with jokes, like Thor: Love and Thunder. Quantumania is another Marvel hit, I'm sorry to say that (I recently saw a critic I was following saying that he thinks it's impossible for anyone to claim that about this movie, so I'm here to prove otherwise).Finally, I need to comment that I think the ""Lydia TÃ¡r critics"" are tired of the MCU, and decided to choose this good movie as a victim of this tiredness... Well... I'm not tired, and I'm far from tired :)"
9," Don't get the hate
",Halgs,/user/ur20722457/,19 February 2023,"I honestly do not get the dislike or hate.The movie is very solid. Yes, Modok was ridiculous but it was a fun ridiculous.The funny part was not really over the top. It was quite right.I also think the movie makes a really good starting point for what is to come. We saw what one of the Kang variants is capable of. If this is the one that Ant-Man got to defeat, the other ones will be next level evil.My only issue is that the movie didn't have any consequences in itself. I was quite glad and satisfied when Scott and Hope were both trapped in the realm. Part of me thought ""Yes, they have to stay here now"", off course I knew it would ve temporarily, but I thought it would ve at least until the next movie.At the end they leave and everyone is happy.Still, I enjoyed every part of it."

It's solid. Furthermore, anyone who has kids (like me) will appreciate the sentimentality. No kids .... well you did have parents, right? Plenty of ORIGINAL plot twists as well.Why are so many bashing the CGI? The movie takes place in a fantasy world, a fake world. Anyway, I was on the lookout for ""cheap"" or ""bad"" CGI and saw none. None at all.Any mediocre acting? No ... all the actors were first rate in the leading roles, and the many ancillary roles are solidly acted as well."

",sapronova,/user/ur84874255/,19 February 2023,"I really pains me to write this but last 2 years marvel movies went really down. I believe that writing is the fault. Story isn't interesting anymore. CGI is good, actors are the same, why is it happening? Since Stan Lee passed I think maybe Disney took another direction. Quantity over quality. Don't they see that rating drop badly and they are producing crap? Or it is just money above everything. This is just sad. If people don't go to see these movies in the cinema Disney still makes money on their channel. It is truly horrible that money is the objective here. For last decade these movies were highlights of my week or month I was so excited to wait another one to come out. And I'm not a teenager! But not anymore. Unfortunately Disney corporation reached their greed limit I'm not wasting my money on another garbage film made by them. Enough is enough!"

I loved seeing the Pym family on the big screen together. Hank Pym, Kang, and Scott Lang were all fun characters. The plot wasnt a masterpiece but ive seen much worse big tentpole blockbusters like Transformers that i felt empty after watching. This movie is solid entertainment with a somewhat meddling middle act but a very fun final act. Picture Tron: Legacy and thats this movie. Its a single story part of a bigger continuing universe. See this because its a solid scfi somewhat family mcu movie. Thor Love and Thunder had a bad final act but I really enjoyed the final act in this one."
8," Very good but something is missing
",Hermione_Mertcan,/user/ur39231153/,19 February 2023,"7 is well-deserved but wanted to give 8 just because I think 6.6 is not enough.Very good movie. No spoilers, decent sci-fi setup and plot with very good acting from especially Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd but it falls short due to some reasons.I can't quite put my finger on it but I suspect it is the classic Team X type of superhero movie thing. Ant-Man should have been the hero, even the Wasp was too much of an addition the last time but now, we have 5 main heroes, some with some deus ex machina types of powers. It made predicting the ending of the movie relatively easy.Kang was a great addition though. The movie might suffer from some details but the reason it deserves at least 7 is that the main villain was incredible.A quick problem came to my mind when writing this though. M. O. D. O. K. is an awful design with all his scenes and his character, simply awful."
4," Some good, some bad, and lots of goofy
",lukebohn,/user/ur122848421/,18 February 2023,"I respect you and have no problem if you love this movie, and all the recent Marvel stuff in the last year or two. However, ever since Spider Man: No Way Home, I have been pretty consistently disappointed by Marvel. It just seems to be that they can't connect the storylines, make a tone that works, and try new things that end up working on a consistent basis. Quantumania is a breath of fresh air in some ways, but in others it's just more of the same.Let's start with the good. Kang the Conquerer (the new big badguy) is VERY good. Johnathan Majors is obviously a very good actor, and he gets most of the good lines and dialogue in this film. Everytime he is on screen, the movie's tone turns serious and it gave me chills at points. I am very excited to see the future of Kang. The Quantum Realm is also a breath of fresh air from the usual Marvel scenery. The action is mostly good as well, and kept me interested. Along with some jokes that were actually pretty funny, I did laugh out loud a few times. Although, sometimes it was at the movie.Now, the bad and extremely goofy. Firstly, the poor Marvel writing consists, and there are so many corny and goofy lines in this movie. It gets to the point where it seems that they are trying to parody themselves. Cassie Lang actually says ""They're Quantum people....in the QUANTUM REALM????"" Also, it seems like some of the cast don't wanna be there, like Michael Douglas and the actress that plays Hope (she barely gets any lines anyways). The visual effects are hit or miss, ranging between beautiful and extremely distracting. Finally, like I said there is so much goofy that it is hard to take the more dramatic moments serious. Whether it's MODOK, Bill Murray, or the random corny lines at bad times. It just impacted the movie for me.Overall, I think if you like most Marvel stuff, or just love Ant-Man, you will like this film. Some people might love all the goofy, which I would understand. However, for me, it just made me more tired of Marvel in general. The silver lining is I am excited with the future of Kang and phase 5 . I think if they start to improve and innovate more, the future of Marvel could be bright."
8," I like it
",rizwanyasin,/user/ur100200511/,18 February 2023,"After reading some reviews, I thought it's going to be terrible and was expecting disappoint. However, it was actually decent movie. J Major did a awesome job playing Kang. Also if you've watched Loki season 1 on Disney then you'll understand the story line much better. I do feel like they could have taken a bigger risk with the story line. There are two end credit scene, I believe it was worth it staying for the first end credit scene but not the last end credit scene. All it did was setup a Disney plus series.My final advise would be to rewatch Loki season 1 before going to watch quantanmania."
6," Could of been great
",hwaid-67357,/user/ur151649908/,18 February 2023,"The first part of the movie was a mess. It's like it wanted to be a star wars movie and a lot of things didn't make sense. The movie had a lot of cool concepts that just weren't executed well and your sort of just thrown into it. The best part of the movie is Kang but i feel like he could of killed everyone at anytime and just didn't. The ending was pretty good but could of been so much better if they decided to make it darker or have kang escape, it doesn't make sense for kang to be beat by antman when he's destroyed entire worlds. Overall the movie was a mess but it had good ideas and leaves room for more. Kang was a great villain and I'm definitely exited to see him more."
1," Horrible
",chaayareehal,/user/ur162470974/,18 February 2023,"The story started with Antman being famous and even releasing his own book VERY ORIGINAL! Then Cassie ( Antman's daughter ) in less then 10 minutes from the start of the movie transported the whole family into the quantum realm. Apparently Janet ( Hope's Mum ) had this very extreme past and in this realm making the whole story more and more complicated. The amount of people's information was very unnecessary for the story. Finally after two hours watching this in 4d was a whole waste of money, the only thing that had potential is Cassie a girl with some good energy and personality. This is really disappointing for the marvel movies after all of this."
5," Now this isn't an Avengers Level Threat...
",MovieWarfare,/user/ur112855274/,18 February 2023,"Who would've thought that a hero called ""Ant-Man"" would succeed in a trilogy? I massively enjoyed the first one but found the second one to be quite forgettable. I loved the idea of smaller stake stories for Ant-Man films. It was a little surprising to hear that Ant-Man 3 would have bigger stakes as I didn't find this to suit the character. Is this a good entry for the little guy or quantum garbage?The greatest highlight of this film is the antagonist, Kang the Conqueror, played by Jonathan Majors. Kang is fearsome and menacing with a terrific performance by Jonathan that reminds me of Darth Vader. He steals the show in every scene, to the point that I was actually rooting for him. I am also glad that his performance is vastly different to the variant we saw in the Loki (2021) show. I can't wait to see more of Kang in the future! In terms of performance, I also enjoyed seeing more of Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne. She was barely in the second Ant-Man film but here she is front and centre. She shines in her performance and perfectly illustrates the guilt and fear her character is experiencing. Paul Rudd is still charming and charismatic as Scott Lang. His relationship with his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) is still the main core of his character. We get to see 'some' serious moments with his character which was nice to see.Another thing I liked was the overall design of the Quantum Realm. The world and the living beings in the Quantum Realm were interesting. It had a very Star Wars/Mad Max feel to it with the blend of sci-fi, deserts and alien-like creatures. The 3rd act of the movie is also quite entertaining. For the most part, it's a giant CGI battle with lots of things happening on screen but it is fun to watch. I especially loved seeing Kang in action because we get to see how much of a beast he is compared to previous villains.However, the writing is very weak. There are a lot of silly dialogues that just made me roll my eyes. It doesn't help that for some reason Marvel is still doing forced unnecessary humour. If this story is meant to be higher stakes then make it serious! The quips get overly repetitive. The first half is a little dull too with minimal interesting things happening. It doesn't take until over halfway through the movie to actually see Kang. Additionally, the ending was disappointing. It is very bland and safe which is a shame as this film could've delivered a shocking and memorable ending. This movie is also meant to build up hype for the next Avengers film but that ending fails to do even that.MODOK is also in this film and it is a pointless addition. Not only do they change the character completely from their comic counterpart, but their role in the story is also absolutely irrelevant. Could take them out of the story and nothing will change. Despite the film being called Ant-Man and the Wasp, both Scott Lang and Hope feel like side characters in their own film. They have no character development and are just kind of there for the ride. Janet is more of a main character than them. I also don't like this trend in these recent Marvel films of Marvel characters looking out for these young characters. Cassie is the next in this trend and is also an annoying character like many of them before. I think Kathryn Newton is fine in her role but her character just isn't written well to be likeable enough for me to care. This is also a very CGI-heavy film and for the most part, it is okay but there are definitely times when it looks rough. The editing, especially during action sequences, can be really bad. They tend to do too many quick cuts during action sequences and for some reason use the shaky cam in 2023!Overall, Ant-Man 3 is a bit disappointing. There was a lot of potential for this to be something great but the execution is quite poor. This isn't a great start to Phase 5 and I am getting worried about the future of the MCU. They need to do a better job at making people hyped for the next Avengers-level threat as this film isn't making me think this is a threat equal to or better than Thanos. I'm hoping future Marvel films start building up this new threat because they need to show us that this new threat is worthy of our attention."
7," What's Eating at Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania
",Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,/user/ur14280854/,18 February 2023,"Welcome back, Streamers, to this quantum realm version of Stream To Big Screen! This weekend Marvel released its third film on the little hero with a big heart, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. And, child, there is some mania going on here. If you've missed the previous two Ant-Man movies, this edition follows up with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd/Ant-Man) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly, The Wasp), along with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), as they are forced to explore the Quantum Realm again. This time they find it's not as barren as previously thought, and they end up interacting with strange creatures and embarking on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they previously thought was possible. Oh yeah, they run into Kang the Conqueror as well. Let's see how it goes.Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway, this is an MCU movie and it obviously should be viewed on a big screen. How much should we pay for that is the question? Here, we're on the back of two successful movies, even if not primary characters of the MCU. The most successful parts of the movie are the CGI, created characters and general realm. The small package delivers big time with those features. Honestly, if you go to Avatar just for the visuals, Quantamania definitely can can follow suit. We've seen space creatures previously in the MCU but they took it up in imagination for this one.Next to that, you know from the Ant-man genre, they are going to bring the laughs. Here there are definitely a few good laughs, but unfortunately, some moments meant to be laughs just felt corny. Even worse was the fact that they kept harping on one particular joke until the end and it never really worked from the beginning. To this point, I felt the movie lost a bit of its heart or character. It felt more like another MCU-movie instead of an Ant-Man movie. We miss you Michael Pena and TI! Anyway, that issue might also have been due to wrong edits selected or what I felt was a rushed storyline. The movie overall didn't feel rushed but something about the pacing just made it feel thrown together. Was I unprepared or were they? Who knows, but I kept feeling it. Nevertheless, the cast as a whole were very good, even the annoying daughter who unfortunately we're likely to see more of based on the thought of a Young Avengers movie coming to us in the years to come.Long story short, Ant-Man and the The Wasp: Quantamania is a solid and visually stunning movie with a rushed set up that makes the plot a bit average. Viewers will be fully entertained either by action or by the corny comedy but won't be truly wowed by the film compared to other movies in the universe. The MCU is falling victim to the Netflix virus, too much content too soon. The movie is enjoyable, but it felt like it was missing some of the previous movies' heart. Obviously, see this on the big screen at any price, but you'll be glad you saved a few bucks with the matinee."
4," If you're into mindless CGI
",josephmpapp,/user/ur71598083/,18 February 2023,"Marvel makes pretty things. This looks fine. It looks a lot like your typical CGI star wars stuff. The biggest pro of this is a likeable badguy. He's genuinely played well, but you go through an hour before he really comes on screen.The quantum people are interesting looking, but written like a smurf cartoon. The battles are the same CGI BS battles you've seen in every other movie.The first Teo movies are far better. The music, the capers, and the characters work well. In this, it's just boring.I'm sure MCU fans like it. Please go ahead and enjoy yourself. But, for people who are just passing time, it would be better you skip it.Biggest issues:
The jokes are flat
They use the word ""Dick"" too much for kids
It's genuinely boringThe positives:
MCU fans will like it
It's the only game in town aside from avatar
Kang was played well."
10," Review of my new favourite MCU film... seriously, you critics are dumb.
",PaperMarioKnight4178,/user/ur150348496/,18 February 2023,"Ant-Man is my favourite MCU superhero. His charm, charisma, power-set, and great characterisation, I loved this guy since the first Ant-Man film. And I loved the films in general, with the characters, the more smaller than stake story, and it's delightfully charming humour. So, of course, I was excited for the next Ant-Man film. Unfortunally, a lot of people really hated it. Personally speaking... I think they are dumb.Now, you're allowed to like and dislike something, but I feel like the critics don't understand the amount of heart, soul and love that went into this film. So let's cover that shall we.Our story starts with Ant-Man being at an all time high in his hero career. His relationship with Hope is as strong as ever, his superhero career is appreciated all around the world, and he is a well-selling author. There's only one problem. His relationship with Cassie is dwindling, becoming worse. Later, after Cassie, Hank, and Hope revealed they were working on a Quantum Realm satellite in secret, a weird signal ends up trapping the whole Ant-Fam in the Quantum Realm... only this time, they're not alone, with a new threat that will end the world as we know it.Let's get the best thing out of the way, Kang is an amazing villain. He is perfectly acted, and is very threatening in every scene he was in. He's also not at all sympathetic, not even trying to hide the fact that he is evil for a minute. However, he's not just generic evil tyrant, but an actual threat, with him almost killing Cassie in a very tense scene. And he's also perfect as the main villain of this film. Although he's a manipulator, he's not a liar. He tells the truth to Scott and Janet, and even promise Janet something that he could've kept had Janet not betrayed him. This makes him more than just your standard everyday villain, which is good, cause he's gonna be the main villain from now on.So the threat of Kang is good, but what about M. O. D. O. K. ? Well, he's also decent as well. I liked how they tied into the first Ant-Man film, I really like the fact he was sorta given a fun personality, and I really like the fact that they try to give him a redemptive arc, as well as a believable reason for why he would want to become M. O. D. O. K. He spent half of his life trying to make the ultimate weapon in the first Ant-Man, but was unwell, he was bitter by the Hank's betrayal, and was driven insane by the Pym Particles, to the point where after Scott destroyed his business, the one thing he had left, he went insane, donning the Yellowjacket suit, and tried to kill him and everything he loved. But he lost, only to be caught by Kang, and given the chance to get revenge, within time, and become the Mental Organism Designed Only For Killing. Is he perfect, far from it. Is he interesting and compelling now, yes.Now that we talked about the villains, let's talk bout the heroes. Scott was as charming than ever, while also being able to pull the serious moments with him and Kang really well, and I like his banter with Cassie. Speaking of her, since Scott and Cassie's relationship are a big part of the film, I really like the fact that she got more screen time. I also like the fact that, although she is skilled enough with the suit, she's not perfect, and I love this metaphor of being how they've gotten distant these past years, but when Cassie started remembering the lesson Scott had teach her, she started getting better.Hope and Hank were also good, if they only had very little to do out of the main cast. Though, this film had the best foreshadowing of all time, where before, you saw the ants go into the Quantum Realm too, and they don't give any attention to it, outside of Hank getting weird signals. It wasn't obvious enough to predict, but it was cleverly set in advanced and I love it.But the best out of the main heroes, definetly goes to Janet. She got way more to do than the last two Ant-Man films, and I love it. I like how we got to see more of her life in the Quantum Realm, and I love her connection with Kang. That way, it feels any scene with them together more personal in stake, and Janet got a more interesting character before that doesn't overshadow any of the other characters.Enough about character. How's the film itself? Well, just as good. I do hate the fact that we don't have the other side characters in this film, but honestly, they would've interfered with the plot a bit, a problem that has plagued the MCU for a bit now. I like the fact that this film learned from previous films and tightly made this film. There are no filler scenes, and the plot moves every scene, no matter who is in the focus.A lot of people complained about the pacing, but it's just as perfect. There are no filler, and as such, the plot can introduce what the film wants at its own pace. Along with that, the film is very gracious in that they take time explaining this easily that everyone understands.Another thing I like is that even though that it is probably the most serious of the Ant-Man films, it's still at the end of the day an Ant-Man film. There's still the charming humour and characters you like. A lot of people complain about the tonal inconscitent but it feels like they got that down too, where they still add the comedy, but also stop when you're supposed to take the story seriously, with almost no jokes in the finale. M. O. D. O. K. Came close, but, not fully where I was distracted.This is also the weirdest MCU movie, but it's not to the point where you can't take it seriously. It easily just exists, and unless you're some sort of critic who just wants to nit-pick that this shouldn't even be able to exist in the real world, even though this is a fictional universe where people can grow and shrink in a suit that also allows them to go into another realm, then you should be fine.The weirdness is also represented in the visuals. Seriously, this film looks stunning, to the point where I wouldn't be suprised if Disney almost went bank rupt when making this film. Again, M. O. D. O. K. Looks a little off, but i was able to shrug it off and not let it distract me. Every scene is eye-candy to look at, and I don't care if it's CGI, this is amazing.The first two Ant-Man films were about second chances, and how we should cherish them. This film asks the question, what if you run out of second chances. Scott has lost so much time with Cassie that they became distant, and Janet had became so paranoid that she became distant from her family. It shows that there are only so many second chances you can take, before you run out, so you better make the most of your chances now. Time runs out for everything, and it feels like it's always too soon when something ends, and sometimes, you could just wish to rewind and start over. But that will never happen. So really, the line Hank Pym said in the first Ant-Man film, ""second chances don't come often, so the next time you see one, take a good close look at it."" is true. And that is also why Kang is the perfect villain for this film. He literally has the ability to control time, so it could've been easier for Scott and Janet to take the easy way out and take Kang's offer. But the thing is, Kang is too dangerous to let out. Meaning that Scott and Janet have to sacrifice their own chance of happiness, there chance to see their daughter again, so they could stop Kang. The metaphor is perfect here. There's no rewind button, there's no fresh start, and time will run out. So, appreciate what you have, and learn from your mistakes if you are given another chance, and grow.And that's all. With all this and barely any flaws to take, I feel safe to say this film is near perfection. There are some bits that aren't as good, but the amazing severely out-weigh the negatives, making this my all time favourite MCU movie ever. It gets a 10/10 and any critic who says it's bad is lying or tired of the MCU. But give this one a chance, I'm sure it find it as brilli-ant as I did."
10," Moodock has finally arrived
",gabethedinosaur,/user/ur33283012/,18 February 2023,Moodock was the best character in ant man . His design looked so awesome and more different than the comics and lego avengers game . He had more gadgets which I say is so cool . I hope he comes back in the next marvel movie. Hopefully avengers and maybe Deadpool 3 or maybe loki season 2 . Moodock has an important plot to the multiverse. He can travel anywhere he wants . Maybe he can travel to venoms universe and make some arrangements. And venom would be very intrigued by the offer moodock gives him . Vulture would team up with moodock and venom . They find Spider-Man and try and learn his secrets.

",jkhvegas,/user/ur101098371/,18 February 2023,"Where do I start, well it's complete ripoff of star wars, the action was terrible. Why didn't ant-man turn into giant man when modok was after him and his daughter? It doesn't make sense and Michael Douglas was just there to fly a ship and have an army of ants attack kang. It's Michael Douglas they could of something more with him. And modok, just no,no and no he wasn't really a good villain and the cg, ugh. The post credit scenes added nothing to the mcu, it was just advertisements for avengers 5 and loki, nothing was connected to the mcu. They need to find a different director for ant-man 4."
6," Slightly better than expected.
",thesuperkid-01997,/user/ur152218107/,18 February 2023,"It begins humorous, becomes mind numbing, then redeems itself during the middle. A lot can be said about this film. Some performances were surprisingly awful and some were incredible. Cassie Lang played by Kathryn Newton was irritating, obnoxious, and unconvincing, adding nothing to the story. Meanwhile, being poorly written, I don't why she was chosen to replace Emma Fuhrmann from 'Avengers Endgame'. Janet Van Dyne played by Michelle Pfiffer was also underwhelming, as she showed little emotion during lines, and I failed to feel any kind of connection to the character. On a more positive note, Paul Rudd's humor was absolutely off the charts (as it was in every other performance I've seen him in). Jonathan Majors delivered, by far the greatest performance, as most of his lines are composed of philosophical ideas, and made me question who was right and who was wrong. Kang The Conquerer will become an interesting and conflicted moralist in the MCU. Obviously it was great to see Bill Murray as Lord Krylar. The overall plot was very weak, recycling over used plot points from other Marvel films. That is until the gears shift during the middle, when more of Kang's backstory is explained. If you're a Marvel fan, or at least genuinely interested in the MCU, It's definitely worth checking out. My opinion will probably change in due time, but as of right now 6/10."
7," Ant man and the Wasp: Quantumania was just ok.
",cele_mcr,/user/ur26703100/,18 February 2023,"I really liked the first Ant Man movie, and the second was also very good. So I wanted to see another Ant Man movie of course and as soon as I saw this one was in the theatres I went to see it. I liked some things in this movie but not everything. One of the things that I really missed about Ant Man was the fact that in the other two movies all of the things that happened in the story, were set up in the real world; and in this one everything was just happening in the Quantum Real, which I though it would be great, but after a while I thought it was a bit boring. I loved the villain though, Jonathan Majors did a really good job, but didn't quite really cared about what happened while all of the characters were in the Quantum Realm. So, to me the script was just not so good in this movie. The visual effects were incredible as you could expect but I feel a bit disappointed because I really wanted this movie to be great. The Ant Man movies by themselves for me really worked outside the Avengers movies, and had their own style. But this one unfortunately was just entertaining and nothing else. I hope the next Marvel movies step up a little bit on the scripts because that really makes a difference. 7/10."

",engmsek,/user/ur68136691/,18 February 2023,"I watched the movie in the cinema, and I saw it as very normal movie and over rated.So I would like to highlight that the actors was doing well but the story it self is over and over.Even some scenes found un-understandable and how there mom came back it's not clear in the movie.And the intro of the movie is low rate honestly. They can did better.At the I am thinking all the team and than the director and all the crew for participating in this project and hope they will get good scope in the next movies.Finally I found the camera man and sound system effect found great and amazing.Hope you like my review."

A return to the roots may be a good choice.I am disappointed. Quantumania, the last Thor, the Black Widow are cut by ths same hands.Please change this path."
," manages to provide some enjoyment even if it's not great
",Special-K88,/user/ur1596208/,18 February 2023,"Under-the-radar Avenger Scott Lang is making the most of his life with Hope van Dyne and his teenaged, scientifically-inclined daughter Cassie who's budding interest has led her to study the Quantum Realm. Unfortunately Cassie's curiosity leads to an accident that pulls her, Scott, Hope, along with Janet van Dyne and Hank Pym into the strange, dark Quantum depths faced with an adversary they can't possibly hope to defeat. It doesn't take very long to figure out that this third Ant-Man film is looking to raise the stakes and spectacle with big, broad action scenes and incandescent visual effects, but to put it bluntly it's easy to see that much of the inspiration came from the Star Wars franchise. The jokes don't always land, the callbacks are expected, and it piles on too much sentiment in its latter stages, but there's a good collection of characters that are actually worth caring about, the villain is a formidable one, and it's able to create some anticipation for Phase Five. Is it the be-all end-all MCU film? No, but it provides quite a bit of fun in its own way. ***"
6," I don't get the hate, But it's NOT a Masterpiece
",SplitaxJedi,/user/ur133716455/,18 February 2023,"Sure the movie isn't a masterpiece, and all of the MCU movies have plot-holes. I would even say that one of most beloved movies like Endgame has daring plot-holes.So my assumption is that people are just tired of this formula of the movies, and if marvel won't change something, Phase Six is going to be their last phase (six cause they planned everything up to six for now).Some plot points are just explained as ""oh i guess that just happened"".Kang's motivation... There isn't really any motivation, we know there is something but they said nothing about it in this movie.Whole movie is one big CGI fest and, everything except the actors is CGI.MODOK looks like crap, but fortunately enough he isn't unmasked in the movie a lot. Mostly you will see him in the mask so that helps, they should just left him in the mask whole time.But looking at it as a big Only CGI movie, it looks ok, of course there is going to be some instances where it will look iffy.Oh end the credit scenes. First one is bad, I thought they will show it in much more serious way, but it looks bad.Second scene... If you liked Loki Show, you will be happy to see that."

My only regret os I didn't give it a chance to shone in 3D as I imagine ot would've looked incredible.It didn't blow my mind or leave me self reflecting or stunned at any point but it looked great, funny bits were funny and the plot was sound. The actors, especially Majors were good and really gave the villains a chance to shone.Reading other reviews it seems a lot of reviewers have forgotten to just enjoy their free time and enjoy a movie for what it is!

The majority of the film takes place in a setting where there is so much green screen, it's impossible to get a sense of scale- which is not good when the key selling point of your main characters is that they can grow/shrink. Sadly this contains some of the clunkiest dialogue I've heard in any film (audible laughs at all the wrong places in the screening I was in) - a shame when thinking back to the zippy first outting of Ant-Man. Jonathan Majors steals the show, and for the most part appears as though he's acting in a different film to everyone else."

6," It's been a while now, but the MCU has really run out of gas....
",flicklover,/user/ur0266568/,18 February 2023,"Well it's happened. The MCU has run out of gas. The last few MCU films have been lackluster at best. Not counting the sort of stand alone Spider-Man No Way Home. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is supposed to start the Phase 5 of this thing and if it goes on like this it's going to get worse!!! This film is of course competently made, looks good and is not horrible but is completely uninspired and like pretty much everything out of the MCE factory since Endgame it's totally forgettable. The reason that the MCU was so successful is that the films had characters we cared about. Stakes were there, of course they were lightoments but there were heroes to root for and some pretty good villains. We cared about what was on the screen. I didn't care at all about what I saw in Quantumania. Not that every film from Iron Man to Endgame was great but they were mostly at least better than average. The two previous Ant-Man films were among the weakest but were still more memorable than this one. The acting in Quantumania is fine but but again no one to really care about. Even Paul Rudd who is usually very engaging us just flat here. He seems to be phoning it in. The only notable performance is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror but he alone can't save the film from being just painfully average. It's never boring but it's just not exciting or engaging.Just average in an MCU that us just churning out film after film with average results. I think Kevin Feige and company should go back and see what made these films better when the MCU started.Painfully average.Grade: C."
6," Just a little bit disappointing.
",elsaandamber,/user/ur115164614/,18 February 2023,"I mean, this movie was super hyped up and it just didn't reach that at all. Some of the writing was artificial and just unfunny ('Don't be a dick!') and all of the cities in the Quantum Realm were trying so, so hard to be Star Wars or maybe even Dune. MODOK's special effects were frankly appalling and I don't know how that got past any test views - seemed like it was there for a joke that didn't land? I'm just not really sure. The plot was pretty good though, and Jonathan Majors was AMAZING as Kang, and Paul Rudd was Paul Rudd. Was it an ok movie? Sure. Would I watch it again (unless there was nothing else available?) Probably not. Overall, it was okay. Not really sure how this happened after the great film that was Wakanda Forever."

7," this had its up and down!
",rashadsteelewolfe,/user/ur127471672/,18 February 2023,"Jonathan Majors stole the show of course. Paul Rudd was very good as well. The pacing felt like it was two movies. One being a story of Kane and Janet. The second story was the Ant family, which includes Cassie, Scott, Hope, Janet and Hank. I didn't like the awkward moments as even the actors looked and felt awkward as it was show a possibly lesbian relationship for Cassie. Which seems to be forced as we have no seen Cassie with any young men to compare it to. Sure some one of the same gender can be awesome but that doesn't mean we fall for them. I do hope going forward the MCu tries to do a better job at this. All they need to do is look at the Last of Us season 1 episode 3 or V for Vedette to see a better way."
3," Tries to hard
",judaverboom,/user/ur41283474/,18 February 2023,"Ant-Man Quantum Mania is like trying to shrink a building with a shrink ray - it's just not possible. The movie tries so hard to be funny, action-packed, and exciting, but it falls short in every aspect.First of all, the plot is all over the place. It's like the writers had a bunch of different ideas for the story, and they just threw them all together. It's like they were playing a game of Mad Libs, and the plot was the result. It's hard to keep up with what's going on, and you just end up feeling confused.The characters are just as confusing. There are too many of them, and they all seem to be vying for screen time. It's like a big game of ""who's the most important character."" I mean, sure, we love Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, but do we really need to see so much of him? And don't even get me started on the villains. They're like cartoon characters, and not in a good way.The action scenes are just as confusing. There's so much going on, and it's hard to tell what's happening. The special effects are cool, but they're overused. It's like the filmmakers were trying to distract us from the mess of a movie they created.In conclusion, Ant-Man Quantum Mania is a movie that tries too hard and fails miserably. If you're a die-hard Marvel fan, you might enjoy it, but for the rest of us, it's a waste of time. Save your money and watch something else."

Marvel needs to come up with something fast! Let's hope the other movies live up to the hype! Bring us the villain the fans deserve! Bring us our MCU Doctor Doom!.

4," All style, very little substance....
",tommullins-43222,/user/ur125201937/,18 February 2023,"I should start this review by saying I'm not the biggest fan of marvel films generally and I wasn't particularly in the mood for a superhero film today either so please take this into account when you see my rating. That being said there are a few marvel films that I do genuinely enjoy like the iron man trilogy and being that Ant Man 3 (don't want to waste characters on the title) was the only new cinema release this week, I decided to give it a go. The third in the Ant Man trilogy, following on from Ant Man and Ant Man and the Wasp sees Scott Lang/Ant Man (Paul Rudd) and his family pulled accidentally into the quantum realm where surprise surprise there's an angry man destroying everything (these worlds need better counsellors) and it's up to Ant Man and co to stop him. The film has a bland plot and an even blander colour palate, most of the film is really dark and then suddenly there will be bursts of light from lasers that to be honest were the only thing keeping me awake for much of the film. The cast are fine, the writing is cookie cutter and generally awful and Jonathan Majors as Kang the ANTagonist seems to be getting heavily praised for his part in this film despite not really doing all that much apart from delivering a lot of trash talk dialogue.Whilst I'm far from a huge marvel fan myself I appreciate that perhaps unfortunately these films are keeping a lot of cinemas open at the moment and so I have to respect them for that, I just wish people were more opened minded to non superhero films. This was a great example of everything I dislike about the mcu, too many of their films rely almost entirely on having recognisable actors to carry along the same old tiresome narratives and I'm over it."
10," I wouldn't really agree with the Critics
",hnkysww,/user/ur119206574/,18 February 2023,"What the critics are saying is that this movie is not as good as the Phase 4 (except for Eternals), but I wouldn't really agree with them on that aspect. The action in this movie is less boring than what we saw in Eternals, Thor: Love and Thunder, and almost every Disney+ show thanks to Kang The Conqueror's Debut, which was good. Others may say that this movie is not as good as it seems, in fact this movie for any Marvel fan, is very important for people to see it especially for those who are optimistic for future MCU movies like Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, since the MCU is taking us far deeper into the Multiverse each time."
9," Back to the roots
",kosmasp,/user/ur5876717/,18 February 2023,"No pun intended - also probably not really true to call it roots. Not entirely - but that is why I go with puns. Hopefully to give a bit of joy and entertainment, while also having a deeper cut. Not too deep mind you - most of the time. And that is how you should experience this too. On an Imax screen if possible, but with an open mind (even more important).The movie works - not because it without flaws. Not because it makes sense (probably not even all the inner logic is ... tight) ... but because it is fun. And all that without Michael Pena! I won't say who is in this - you either know or you will find out. The movie begins with Ant Man reintroducing himself to us. If you have forgotten who he is - or if you haven't seen any other movie yet. It makes sense to be up to date ... but it is not necessary. And it is what makes this even more fun.The movie also channels a lot of Science Fiction ... well movie history before. It's not that Star Wars did not steal .. sorry, homaged other Science Fiction stuff, so if you see Star Wars here ... if you see Pixars lamp here (I'm quite sure I am not the only one who does), if you think of Lord of the Rings when you hear the tower line ... heck even the ""get to the chopper"" line can be spotted ... well tweaked and all that. But still if you look hard enough ... there is a lot to enjoy.And the movie has quite a few things to entertain the adults too. Not just the hints to the past of Michelle Pfeifers character (she had needs too), but also the use of curse words. Even with a ""holy"" in front of it, it did surprise me to hear the s word twice in the movie. I was not offended and I would hope no one else was.And I have not even gotten into the story - into the plot of the movie. It works as I already wrote without any prior knowledge ... it does link to other things though ... and the post credit scene especially is a foreshadowing of the best kind ... some even call it one of the best post credit scenes Marvel has done yet. You decide ... one thing is for sure, if you suspend your disbelief and just go with the flow ... the cast is fun enough to make you forgive its missteps ... be it almost botched character arcs ... jokes that may or may not work with you ... and the overall tone of the movie.A tone that switches - the same way Jonathan Majors seems to be able to switch. What a great find for the MCU - charismatic, yet able to draw you in. Maybe he is not that bad after all? But isn't the devil the most charming of them all? Or at least that is what they say ... while Christian Bale gathered a lot of praise for his Thor villain ... Kang is here to stay - I had to do at least one more pun and you know it.Ant Mans daughter who is recast for the movie - she seems to have a bright future ahead of her. There is a lot of rumor going around about the MCU and their planning for the future ... and the future is for the young ones ... isn't it? So sit back, relax and enjoy this movie that (re)intoduces us to Kang ... and if you are not Comic Book savvy ... don't worry, you won't be left behind ... no pun intended to close it all up."
9," Kang drags the movie
",rassimov,/user/ur158041637/,18 February 2023,"Went to see this movie a couple of days ago. I liked him.Yes, it's not a masterpiece, but it entertained me as the third part (I liked the second one much less).The film does not let you get bored for a second.Also, Kang is just mega-cool. The actor has a good action, he really appears impressive and dangerous.But I must say that for me, as in the previous parts, Henk was still the best. Michael Douglas is a great actor! I admire that, unlike some (ahem, Harrison Ford), he gives his best in a superheroic film!)
In the film, a lot of attention is paid to Scott Lang's daughter, and very little to Wasp (although this does not interfere with the film too much).From the bad - the plot is very predictable and there are a lot of clichÃ©s in it (although some of them, like with MODOK, for example, are even ridiculed)."

The newer characters are all very one note and often rely on the same joke as character development throughout.Both MODOK and Cassie really drag the film down, but Hope, Hank and Janet are pretty decent. Kang is also incredibly underwhelming, which is not a great start if this is going to be his saga.Lets hope they do a little bit more to raise the multiversal stakes going forward..."

It gets a little silly but after I accepted the craziness of the quantum realm, I found myself entertained enough throughout the movie to enjoy it. Laughs are scattered throughout which is a good thing. There are some questionable CGI scenes but other than those, it looks pretty amazing. The story is not that complex but the acting was pretty good as a whole. Jonathan Majors pulls off a great performance as Kang and so do the veteran actors which actually received more screen time than I thought they would have.6.5 out of 10 stars."

",kevinvasquezkv,/user/ur60938196/,18 February 2023,"From Start to finish this movie has your attention. It's built off of the events of endgame on the outside world, but once you shrink down to the Quantum Realm. It then shows you the events that happened with Janet and the time she spent with Kang and how she knew who he was & for the all the right reasons she wanted to keep him a secret from the world and her family. Definitely the strongest of the 3 films with non stop hand to hand combat that Ant Man gives us with his Maximum effort spectacular abilities. Kang is the new big bad and my god he is scary. Only reason this movie isn't a 10 is because I would of like to of seen our X-con security team in the movie."

",secret_arash,/user/ur114560829/,18 February 2023,"I would like to take a different point of view towards the problems surrounding the new Marvel movies. Here's the thing, I think the main issue that is causing such disappointments for fans regarding the recent movies is not technical. I don't deny the bad CGI or editing and directing problems, but, the big issue is with the overall storytelling. If you take a good look at each phase and each Saga of the MCU you can kinda look at it as a TV show for which each of the phases act as a season and each of the Saga as a whole show. Storytelling is a vital aspect of any good show. In order to create the best villain, you need appropriate and proper build up. The said build up will probably require to include many side stories which seem to be irrelevant but are portrayed in an interesting way for their own sake. Let me clarify. The first Saga of the MCU was the Infinity Saga which included three phases and Thanos was the ultimate vilain for it. If my calculations are correct, the character had his own movie after 18 others. We repeatedly saw traces of the Infinity stones in those movies and as a result they became a great mystery for us and left a mark in our minds. Therefore, when we finally got to know what exactly they were and how the great villain is going to use them and even what the point of all the chaos around them was, our excitement was beyond imagination. Besides that, we got to know our heroes very well on the ride. In the end we knew everything about them and felt everything they felt because of all the adventures we experienced with them. It was the Finale of the show, and boy what a great Finale it was.Now, it's time for the new show. I haven't read the comics but it seems like Kang is going to be the main villain of the multiverse Saga. The character is really interesting in Ant-Man 3 and I think can make a really great villain. BUT, none of the abovementioned features are present in the new Saga. The character is not only introduced in the very first movie of phase five but also is the main focus of the second half of the movie. I don't want to mention his faith in the end but let me just say it was not OK with me especially when the name of The next Avenger movie, which by the way is coming out only two years after this, is Kang Dynasty. The great villain of the new Saga fought only Ant-Man and a couple of not interesting side characters of the Avengers. How can I hope for such villain to grow into one which I respect and fear? The issue with the new Saga is that after each movie, or show, you cannot find a good answer for the question of ""what was the point of the movie?"" I mean one could question the necessity of its existence. Most of the movies and shows are just there to badly introduce new heroes to us. Dont get me wrong this must be done, as it was in the first Saga, but back then the introduction of heroes was not the main focus of each movie. They were introduced and then given a proper villain to fight. And the fights had proper conclusions. Now, for a second, think about doctor strange 2, black panther 2, Ant-Man 3, Thor 4, or any of the shows and see if you can find anything without which the overall story would be hurt. Let me summarize some of the recent projects of MCU for you: ""SPOILER ALERT""Falcon and winter soldier: Falcon is the new captain AmericaMoon knight: there's a new guy with ancient Egyptian powersMs. Marvel: we have a Muslim heroDoctor Starnge 2: America Chavez EntersThor 4: Thor has a kid psychicBlack Panther 2: Shury is the new BP and there's a fish villain in the futureThe point of all of them is telling you there is something great coming and you should feel excited for it. They don't make you feel that way, they tell you to feel that way.The issue of storytelling that Marvel is facing is very complicated and I know I was not able to convey my thoughts about it but I hope you had got the gist. Anyway, I don't think any of the upcoming movies of MCU are going to be an exception of this weakness of storytelling due to their overall relevance and this really pains me that my favorite Cinematic Universe will not make any more good movies for a long time."
7," Kang Rules
",A7medSalah,/user/ur80177773/,18 February 2023,"After a frustratingly rough act 1, Ant-Man And The Wasp Quantumania finally gets going, only to end where this story should've began. While the external stakes are clear & weighty, emotional drive felt slight (and levity even lighter). That said, Jonathan Majors rules.My biggest issue is that I wasn't fully engaged for at least the first half of the movie. I was enjoying it but I wasn't locked in. The story was unfocussed. When the villain becomes prevalent, the movie jumps a level. But it doesn't completely make up for the much weaker first half.The other thing that surprised me was not being mesmerized by the visuals. It's very creative and I didn't notice poor CGI like some others. But it didn't wow me like it frequently does. Maybe we're just getting spoiled with the visuals in movies like Doctor Strange in the multiverse of madness and more recently Avatar 2.M. O. D. O. K Was Good But Not As i Wanted, I Understand Where The Hate Come From.Michelle Pfeiffer Was Amazing Maybe the Third Time is Charm Great Dialogue And Backstory.Of Course Jonathan Major Steals The Show So Excited For What Comes next for Him The Man is A Beast.One of the things I didn't like in the movie is the misuse of The wasp Even Kathryn Newton Had a better writing in the movie pitch. As always paul Rudd delivers and Proves that he is one of marvel's best casting.One of the best aspects about the movie is the soundtrack Christophe Beck fascinates once again.At the end, I enjoyed watching Quantumania. It's a mostly solid and fairly entertaining movie. But relative to MCU standards, it's a bit underwhelming and feels like more of a throwaway movie than something memorable I will keep coming back to."
10," Lots of fun
",jessicaagnos,/user/ur146615865/,18 February 2023,"This movie was extremely enjoyable! Watched in 4D, and the ride was wild. It was fun and funny. I'm not sure what people want out of this genre, considering it's a comic book coming to life. Maybe Marvel has just become too ubiquitous for people. Either way, I enjoyed it a lot and will go back to see it again. I'm really excited for the Jonathan Major's phase of the MCU. I think the poor ratings are coming from critics who take themselves a bit too seriously. Just have fun with it. I thought the CGI was good, especially in 3D. There was a really cool throw to actual quantum physics with the probability storms, which I appreciated."
4," Just watch the mid credit scene and not the movie
",ok-notifications-517-439932,/user/ur37426916/,18 February 2023,"After the desastrous Phase IV Marvel starts the fifth phase with Ant-Man to introduce the new antagonist. This movie feels like a mixture of Star Wars Episode 1 and Mom and Dad save the world. Most of the jokes don't work, world building does not exist, there is no chemistry between ""Dad"" and peanut, cgi looks absurdly bad, a cameo like Bill Murray gets an underused character etc. So, overall, it's not a good movie. It's boring and predictable. Majors does an overall okay job as Kang, but after seeing the Creed III trailer it seems that this type of character is ""his thing"", so nothing special here to see.The biggest problem Quantumania has is that it only exists to introduce Kang for the next Avengers movie and it does this in the mid credit scene, which makes this whole movie unnecessary. They did the same with Thor 4 (Odin) and Wakanda 2 was also only used to set up the conflict of Wakanda 3."
," They forgot Luis
",him090296,/user/ur122315513/,18 February 2023,"How could they forgot Luis? This should have been a person where even at first he only talked to someone in a cafe or walked into the cafe room and saw Scott and said, ""They mix you with Spiderman again?"" It would have been the best 5-10 minutes of any film to be fair. Yes he could have been fitted in at the beginning. Such a shame. He was the one who gave humor, charm, and attractiveness to the two previous films. For your information, I have to admit that Michael PeÃ±a is the only reason I watched Antman (2015) film for the first place. Even if for a small cameo I think Michael PeÃ±a would be fine about it considering we don't know if he dusted of Thanos's snap effect. Double disappointment is because they recasted Cassie from Endgame. Apart from that, only the performance of Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror saved this film. Lord Krylar, Jentorra, and Quaz unfortunately they were so easily forgotten. And M. O. D. O. K was not what I imagined or expected, especially the action towards the end. Scott Lang / Ant-Man, Hope Van Dyne / The Wasp, Dr. Hank Pym, and Janet Van Dyne is good as usual. Overall between 6-7, average at best."
6," Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania
",haydwest,/user/ur159087934/,18 February 2023,"The first two Ant-Man movies are two of my favourite movies ever, so surely this was going to be great, but boy was I wrong. This movie was so disappointing, there was no real story too this movie, and everyone was underused, Kang, M. O. D. O. K, Bill Murray, I was expecting so much more, the MCU has really let itself go in recent years, its standard for what a good movie is has decreased a lot.Ant-Man is my favourite MCU character ever, and the fact that I was watching an Ant-Man movie and Ant-Man wasn't my favourite character really shows how much of a let down this movie is.Also, why did Cassie keep calling Hank and Janet grandma and grandpa, isn't her mother Judy Greer's character from the first two, she's not related to them at all. And in Endgame Scott said that five years in the quantum realm felt like five hours, so in theory if Janet was there for about thirty years, surely she was just in the quantum realm for about 30 hours. Anyway, just a really disappointing movie. 6 out of 10."
6," Another marvel movie that refuses to take itself serious
",amooorales,/user/ur26373760/,18 February 2023,"Convinced marvel movies are just being written by ChatGPT. Kang somehow destroyed multiple versions of the avengers and timelines but gets defeated by an army of ants? I know he comes back but I cannot be the only one who finds this ridiculous. This is why most people are getting burnt out from the MCU. These movies have no integrity and just cater to the mindlesss fans who watches every single piece of media marvels dishes out. Sorry not sorry. I was actually excited for this movie, but once again this movie is just riddled with witty and snarky humor that it takes away from the precedence story. I don't mind humor, it's just take it feels so out of place it takes out the immersion. Every marvel movie just feels like an SNL skit nowadays. If phase 5 doesn't deliver I'm afraid marvel will fall off."
8," It's great but not excellent!
",freddy-teilang,/user/ur53817018/,18 February 2023,"Yes watched this ! I think it's a 7.5 out of 10. The scene were great but could have been better. Kang was massive and superior but his opponents were too weak for him to have had to fight, little bits and pieces could have been knitted properly into getting the best of it but still satisfied.Well I think this movie was not too humorous like thor and too crazy like Dr strange but I felt that more actions would have made it better and the scenes in and out were at time too boring.The story of a good family together, stays together resounded well. The movie had only one guy back from the past and could have added more characters to up the ante!Overall, it was kinda fun and confusing but cool ðŸ‘Œ"
7," Insufficient heart
",neil-476,/user/ur7813355/,18 February 2023,"At last, things are going well for Scott Lang. Reunited with daughter Cassie after the blip, happy in a relationship with Hope, and they and Hank and Janet all safely out of prison, all is well. Except for Cassie, arrested for being a social warrior in between building a device to contact the Quantum Realm. And no sooner does Janet issue a panicked warning to disconnect it than it sucks them all into the Quanum Realm. Where a war is going on.This Ant-Man movie has an entirely feel to its predecessors. There is much less humour, non-stop action, less plot and a very streamlined narrative. I don't want to say much more for fear of spoilering a fairly obvious fact about this movie and Phase 5 of the MCU. On the negative side, this has a place in the Marvel plan without having a strong identity of its own: it doesn't have the warmth it needs. It almost makes up for it with non-stop eye candy/action, but not quite. And even the eye candy seems terribly familiar, being inspired/derivative by other movies.Bill Murray's cameo is pointless.I enjoyed this, but it should have been better: it is somewhat hamstrung by the function it was created to perform in the MCU."
5," Overblown and overcooked despite Paul Rudd's best efforts
",trevorwomble,/user/ur1967931/,18 February 2023,"One of the things I enjoyed about the first film was that it was something a bit different from Marvel. It was a low key film with a neat script and doses of comedy that was a nice distraction and pretty much unconnected from the more po-faced world of the Avengers films. Unfortunately though something seems to have gone wrong here.Firstly we have a story that is a partial rehash of other more recent MCU storylines (baddie wants to be an all conquering god-like presence by destroying anyone who stands in his way). Secondly the actor playing that baddie just seems like a wrong bit of casting as. Jonathan Majors (as Kang) seems to lack much gravitas. I'm afraid I found Majors turn in the role a bit hammy too, being unconvincing and far too two dimensional.I also found the film was cherry picking ideas out of other MCU films like GOTG ( races of weird looking aliens) for one. The story lacks originality, reminding me of Avatar, and the script full of obvious cliches. And both these points in mind I think that, after the last Thor film, Marvel is running out of ideas and its becoming obvious.Whilst it's great having older actors like Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer in these movies, there were times they genuinely seemed embarrassed when they delivered their dialogue. Also the film badly overuses green screen and at times it started to resemble the Star Wars prequels of 20 years ago, with massive CGI battles providing the 'spectacle'.I'm sorry Marvel/Disney but you will have to do better than this sloppy mess Having a charming leas actor just isn't enough to save a film. You have to bring something original to the table too. I thought the recent Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness had it's issues but there was enough originality and novel ideas from Sam Raimi in it to keep it interesting. The same goes for Spider-Man-No Way Home, an overlong film but made watchable by a good story and enough crowd pleasing surprises and to keep it interesting. And whilst Ant-Man doesn't have that legacy, I still think the makers could have done better here.To summarise I found this to be an empty film. It has nothing new to add and feels bloated despite it being one of the shorter Marvel movies. If they had kept the story from getting overblown like this it might have stopped it resembling a dozen other movies. Marvel have had a few critical duds of recent and badly need to rethink their plan if they want to keep their loyal audience from losing interest. If I'm honest, the only film on their slate that I'm genuinely looking forward to at the moment is Deadpook 3."
4," It was alright, I guess...
",vengeance20,/user/ur31117020/,18 February 2023,"Having seen the previous 2 Ant-Man Films, & only remembering bits of them, I went into this one sort of blind, but knowing roughly what to expect.The film sees Ant-Man AKA Scott Lang & explore the Quantum Realm, where they interact with strange creatures and embark on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they thought was possible.I found the film to be not bad. It was alright, but not as good as the first Ant-man & even the second which were both far more grounded than this one was. In other words, it was too sci-fi orientated & could've more grounded to reality.The film does have some great effects boasted here & there for a good chunk of the film & there's some humour & eye candy to be had. The pacing is a little off & the film is a bit too long at 1 hour & 53 minutes, 1 hour & 56 minutes including the post credits scene. As for the story, it could've been better & more coherent.Overall, it's definitely the weakest entry out of the trilogy. The first 2 films are better especially the first. There's some eye candy & laughs to be had & the effects are something else. With a incoherent plot, too many things going on & off pacing & a long runtime, this ranks as the lowest unfortunately.4/10."
8," Great follow-up to Loki S1
",nielw,/user/ur2582281/,18 February 2023,"Loki S1 is probably one of my favorite entries in the MCU, mostly because of Kang. I've been looking forward to his formal entry into the MCU with this movie for some time. Kang is easily the best part of the whole thing.That said, I still enjoyed the whole movie overall. As an MCU fan, I even like most of the less popular entries, including Eternals and Thor 4. This movie sits in the middle of the pack for me. It's still leagues ahead of Thor:Dark World and Iron Man 2, which are my least favorite MCU movies.Maybe I'm just a sucker for the visuals and humor. As a sci-fi fan, I also really enjoyed the nod to quantum mechanics.I'm excited for the future of the MCU!"
4," Bad Marvel movie taken to the Quatum level
",exuguardiaolucifer,/user/ur161908599/,18 February 2023,"I must say as many of older Marvel fans I had low expectations about this or any movie after trainwrecks such as Eternals, Thor 3 and Shang Chi. Even so, Antman shows how bad a cheap plot and a hurry up CGI can be. Not only the plot itself is stupid and full of holes (Modok's origin was destroyed, the female juvenile character is pictured as futile and snob as Kate Bishop, America Chaves or Iron Heart were) but the CGI reminds me the same low key that were all the recent Disney series such as She Hulk, Miss Marvel and Moonknight with many scenes conveniently shoot in the dark and using fast sequences in the background to mask the whole flaws of the FX. Oh, and Kang, gimme a break! The main villan is so scary as my dentist is."
4," The First MCU Film I Have Ever Disliked
",kjproulx,/user/ur23240045/,18 February 2023,"I am a massive fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (also known as the MCU), which is why writing this review is about to sting. Going back to the beginning of the franchise over a decade ago with Iron Man, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger, and their culmination in The Avengers, it all felt special. Yes, after that there were a few stumbles with Thor: The Dark World (which I still mildly enjoy) and Iron Man 2 (which I think gets a worse rap than it deserves), but I've always at the very least thought their projects were anywhere from fine to fantastic. Well, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has now hit theatres and after 41 projects, this is the first one I have straight-up disliked. This film is troublesome for the franchise, and here's why.The story picks up after the events of Avengers: Endgame. Scott Lang's daughter Cassie has been studying science and the Quantum Realm when Scott was trapped for five years. Her curiosities send the two of them, Hope Van Dyne, Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne back into the Quantum Realm together, which leads them to discover that there are entire civilizations living down there. Meeting many new faces and learning that Janet knows of a man named Kang that cannot be released, leads to his big introduction as the new big Marvel villain.This film is basically an introduction to make you buy into this new character of Kang (who was also briefly introduced in the Loki series on Disney+) and I absolutely did. I think Jonathan Majors is absolutely amazing in this role and I can't wait to see all of his future appearances. So why did I dislike it then? Let's dive in.The scenes involving Kang are great, some of the good humour from the past Ant-Man films is also present, and the cast all work very well together as always. With all of that said though, this film is a series of spectacle moments and CGI action sequences, mostly involving characters that the film did not even take the time to make me care about. Everything about the events of this film (excluding Kang) seems inconsequential to the MCU as a whole, or even to the Ant-Man films. It doesn't really feel like an Ant-Man movie, but rather a long side mission that felt plucked out of an Avengers movie. To me, it just did not work.On top of everything, you can visually see that Marvel has been struggling with quantity over quality because there are many moments where I felt like I was watching something budgeted for television. If I first saw this film on Disney+ it would've made much more sense. I hate bagging on movies, especially in a franchise I love so much, but when a film is meant to set up the next huge villain and you want people to flock out and witness that, it just does not seem like enough time or care was put into this story, or even visually (but I also understand the circumstances of Visual Effects artists currently being overworked in the industry too). For something that is supposed to be the start of something much bigger, it is quite a mess in my opinion.In the end, the biggest issue going forward is that people who watch the next Avengers movie may not be able to fully grasp who Kang is and what he can do if they do not watch some of the other films he has appeared in. This has never been an issue with the MCU before. Thanos was teased but never a core character in anything before Avengers: Infinity War. I love this franchise (I will say that a million more times too) and I cannot wait for the next film to be released, but I really hope this studio can figure out a way of making the next event movie accessible to average moviegoers, otherwise, I think they are about to start losing a lot of their audience. Again, this is only the first film I have even remotely disliked after about 41 projects, so obviously, I am still completely on board with everything, but for such a pivotal moment in this franchise, colour me a little worried. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is now playing in theatres."
6," Not as good expected - not a comedy but not a sci-fi
",courtney_london,/user/ur49072633/,18 February 2023,"Ah yes, another disappointing MCU movie. It's not that Quantumania was bad, it just wasn't as good as I expected it to be. So many people disliked Phase 4 in the MCU and this beginning of Phase 5 continued the trend of disappointment.Quantumania begins quick, viewers are swept into the new universe in the opening 5 minutes. Although Quantumania is just over two hours in length, there are a good chunk of scenes that feel unnecessary or bloated (I almost fell asleep in a long drawn out scene).One of my biggest issues with this movie is that there are so many forced comedic scenes and then there are attempts to be a serious sci-fi adventure immediately following. It just doesn't quite have a good balance of either. I truly believe that MCU needs to get a grip on some of these 2nd and 3rd tier characters (GofG, more specifically Peter Quill, Ant-Man and even Thor in some aspects, although I think Thor is a top tier MCU character). The main characters all have the same formula; somewhat goofy guy cracking jokes while side-kicks and supporting characters have to be the serious tone. Somehow the team bands together and saves the universe. I think I would have enjoyed this film more if they put some of the comedy aside and did a better sci-fi adaptation of the Quantum Realm.I love Jonathan Majors as Kang, but there was some about this storyline that made him less intimidating compared to say, Thanos.Oh and finally, I really disliked the ending of Quantumania! You'll know once you watch it but I'm trying to be vague to avoid spoilers!"
6," Fun set up
",masonsaul,/user/ur94560739/,18 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania frustratingly serves the greater the MCU a lot more than it should, abandoning a lot of the stakes and the franchise's unique aspects for a safe and predictable 2 hour phase 5 trailer that confirms the Ant Man trilogy to be the weakest so far.However, it's still a fun and enjoyably wacky sci-fi adventure that doesn't overstay it's welcome, offers the occasional reminder that the MCU formula can work and features a terrific villain in the form of Jonathan Majors' Kang.Paul Rudd is great, it's an inherently safe performance that's likeable without displaying that much range and he nails that yet again. Despite sharing the title Evangeline Lily gets very little to do but Michael Douglas is the scene stealer with the best humour and a lot less expositional dialogue this time around.Kang is a generically evil character here but in the hands of Jonathan Majors he is an absolute force of nature, elevating this one note character into a softly spoken menace who brings the film to life whenever he's on screen.Peyton Reed's direction is fine, it looks competent overall with a few visually impressed moments but struggles to establish real scale within the quantum realm. The CG is the same as it always with these, hit and miss throughout and alternating from impressive to awful within the same scene.The music by Christophe Beck is a bit of a letdown, none of that playfulness or sense of fun that makes the previous Ant-Man scores so memorable is here and it only really comes to life during the credits."
6," Not bad, but not good either.
",moskeman,/user/ur29707737/,18 February 2023,"Movie had a good start, but the story was quickly diluted. For me that's basically the worst part of the movie, story was too basic. It's better than latest Thor and Black Panther, but much worse than any movie by the end of phase 4. Scott Lang is still a good character, Paul Rudd is really good playing him. Grateness of Michael Douglas is noticeable in every scene. I think that the villain has a great potential, but I hope it's not going to be copy/paste Thanos story.. CGI was a bit too much and this Ant-Man movie was a bit better than 2nd part, but for me 1st movie is still the best. All in all, not a bad way to chill out for two hours, but don't expect too much."
8," Back on track!
",aleybassem,/user/ur149575807/,18 February 2023,"This movie definetly brought my hopes up for the rest of the phase. I think some of the jokes could have landed better, but still, anything is better than those Thor: Love and Thunder jokes. The VFX is Oscar-Worthy, except...Modok was horrendous. That face will never leave my mind. I'll have the worst nightmares, that face crawling up to me while in bed. The acting was pretty good. Would have wanted to see more emotions when Cassie shouted ""Dad!"", but Jonathan Majors was.. Exceptional.They couldn't have done a better job at introducing Kang. He seemed so menassing. Also, stay put. As two, mid-credit and post-credit, scenes are available. Don't worry, they will be worth it, especially the last one."
2," Boring
",brianday-35596,/user/ur88397805/,18 February 2023,"This movie had awkward visuals and storytelling, and let me feeling mostly bored throughout. I'm struggling to find anything I liked about it.Pacing: the changes in pacing were weird and whiplash inducing. It starts off fast, with little-to-no introduction of Cassie. They are immediately thrown into the quantum realm. They struggle to get their bearings in a forest, they cut away to other characters, and when we return to them, they're in the middle of a desert being surrounded by alien-like creatures. The film then finally grinds to a halt for the backstory (exposition) the film has been heavy-handedly hinting at. From then on its an endless fast-paced slog of ""and then this happens"" story beats with no interesting developments.Characters: I don't feel we got a proper intro to any of the new characters in the film. Cassie is quickly introduced with expositional dialogue as a strong-willed, scientific genius, social justice warrior, with experience using the pym tech suit. The huge cast of outlandish rebels are introduced in the same scene that they're attacked and routed. Kang is the only new character that gets any kind of proper intro. The way the new characters were introduced combined with the fact they were CG monstrosities made it hard for me to care about or remember any of them.Pointless plot lines: Movie wastes time with a couple plot lines that could be removed without affecting the movie at all. Throw out the distracting Bill Murray bar cameo and MODOK redemption arc and free up some time for stuff that matters.Bad writing: Why does the lead rebel fight robots with a spear? Why doesn't Kang confiscate Cassie's suit while imprisoned? Why can giant Scott withstand focused laser fire from a fleet of ships? Why don't Kang's arm lasers disintegrate Scott and Cassie like everyone else he shoots? I could go on.No stakes: Not once did I feel there were any real stakes for giant CG Scott, CG Kang, the CG rebels, or the CG world they live in. All the action falls flat.Action: the action is a generic punching/kicking, jump-cutty, CG slog. The CG quality and animation in some scenes were noticeably bad, that is when you could see it long enough to understand what was happening. Kang is omnipotent with disintegrating lasers and Jedi force powers until the plot needs him to lose."
9," The Writers and the Director Dialed this one in. . .
",masonj-1,/user/ur2620866/,18 February 2023,"I gave this one a higher rating than it deserved out of loyalty to the Marvel brand.. that said, this seemed like the writers and the director dialed this one in. . .The subtitle for this move might be ""we've never seen a shop worn riff we didn't like"" The visuals were reasonable, and the high-level story made sense in the context of the ongoing MCU -- but the depth and substance were severely lacking.Reference ""The Winder Soldier"" or ""Infinity Wars"" or ""Endgame"" for movies with greater levels of substance. Shang Chi was also a film that focused on family. It was also vastly superior to this effort.I would have thought that it was mandatory for this round of the sequencing of films evolving a Big Bad Wolf story leading up to the Avengers would have to surpass the previous round. No such luck here. Visually perhaps, but not with regard to story substance. . . Perhaps this director, in wrapping up a trilogy, had one foot out of the door and is looking forward to his next assignment.As someone who started reading Marvel comics in the 1960's I know that there is source material with more depth. It appears that Kevin Feige is slipping in his role as the MCU's QA Gatekeeper. Or perhaps Disney, is fixed on Disney-fying the MCU via death by cliche.Please don't F-up the Fantastic Four'"
7," Nice introduction to Phase 5
",beichorndude,/user/ur7828762/,18 February 2023,"Beign the third installment to the Ant-Man (and the Wasp) franchise I went in having an idea what to expect. Something a little light, tone-wise, but with Kang being introduced I also knew the levity would be moved aside for the weight of the story. All previous characters were pretty close to the previous story's portrayal. Michelle Pfeiffer's role was expanded, which she did great with. Kathryn Newton's Cassie Lang filled the role nicely as well, but not quite the same charm as Rudd.I knew that it would be CGI heavy but I felt that made it slightly harder to digest what was going on. Most locations and characters were full of CGI - not that that's a bad thing, but it really made it hard to tell what was happening at time.The story was pretty good. It took a while for it to get to the crux of the problems, but it was a fun ride to get there. . I would have liked a little more backstory on the main villain, but I'm sure we will get more of that as Phase 5 continues.Overall, if you enjoyed the other Ant-Man movies and know that the tone will start getting a little darker, you will enjoy this movie. Just don't expect it to be Civil War or Infinity War."
6," Great visuals in too farfetched and unfathomable story
",johannes2000-1,/user/ur5177700/,18 February 2023,"On the positive side: even after the more than 2 hours I wasn't bored, thanks to the fact that this movie works like an exhausting rollercoaster ride through a CGI-pandemonium that is visually overwhelming. But that isn't enough to make for a good movie.It would have been nice if there had been a solid and understandable story. It may be my too simple brain, but I didn't grasp anything of the premise (the whole Lang-family being sucked into a sub-atomic ""quantum""-universe by some device that teen-daughter Cassie had concocted), or of the subsequent goings-on (thousands of creatures living in the sub-atomic world, as well as a complete city - I mean, doesn't the material that all those people and things were made of consists of atoms too? Atoms within atoms?!?). Of course everyone tried his best to make things believable by all kinds of quasi scientific (meant-to-be) explanations, but I didn't hear a thing that even made slightly sense!As said, visually it's all breathtaking, and the acting is over-all fine enough. But I missed the humor of the first movies, and Ant-Man Scott himself seemed only a supporting character among his all-heroic family-members. The whole family thing got a bit on my nerves anyway, at several times the pace of the movie stopped dead for yet another father-daughter-mother-grandparents sob-moment, making it look like a sub-atomic version of the family Robinson."
7," Funny and family-type of movie
",bowotrahutomo,/user/ur66177401/,18 February 2023,"The rhythm of the story is a bit slow, but it is full of light messages of Family Love, Moral Messages Good and open communication in the relationship between parents and children who must be intimate, trust each other and support each other in times of trouble.Family is everything. The rest, unfortunately the story phase is rather slow and boring. Fortunately, there are funny scenes typical of Ant-Man films and antagonist characterizations that make you laugh.This film cures our longing for the Avengers superhero character. There's a cameo wanting to portray Stan Lee's character; this part of the buying coffee scene is a light but punchy touch of comedy about people's perceptions of Ant-Man."
10," Kang will return
",ClassicCinemaKid,/user/ur37825625/,18 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a phenomenal film that manages to deliver an incredible cinematic experience with its stunning visual effects, engaging storyline, and exceptional performances. Directed by Peyton Reed, the movie has certainly lived up to its predecessor, with even more action, humor, and heart.One of the highlights of this movie is the impressive VFX, which truly immerses the audience in a world of shrinking and growing superheroes. The sequences involving the Quantum Realm are breathtaking, and the action scenes are expertly choreographed and executed. The visuals are top-notch, and the use of 3D enhances the experience even further.The storyline is equally impressive, with a perfect blend of humor and emotion. The movie takes the audience on a thrilling ride through time and space, with a creative and well-crafted script that keeps the viewers engaged throughout. The pacing of the film is just right, allowing for enough character development and action to keep the audience invested in the story.The performances in the film are also exceptional. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man and Evangeline Lily as Hope Van Dyne/Wasp have a great on-screen chemistry, and their comedic timing is spot on. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer as Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne respectively bring gravitas to their roles, adding depth to the story. Jonathan Majors as the new Marvel villain Kang the Conqueror is truly mind-blowing, bringing an intense and intimidating presence to the screen.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a must-see film for Marvel fans and casual moviegoers alike. It is an excellent example of what can be achieved with creative storytelling, innovative visual effects, and exceptional performances. Peyton Reed has done an amazing job with this movie, and it is sure to leave audiences eagerly anticipating the next installment in the Ant-Man franchise."
3," Failure to launch quantum opportunity for MCU phase 5
",grantleclerc,/user/ur162460953/,18 February 2023,"Huge disappointment as had high expectations. Marvel's recent releases haven't been fan-tastic and this is (another) missed opportunity to knock this movie out of the park. Tiring. Disney/Marvel have been trying to grow the franchise too quickly without larger storyline integration but rather a focus on actors and new characters... leaves the audience confused, story line disjointed and disconnected across media.Story and writing was awful. Jokes were childish (really, don't be a dick?). Needs to be believable and Cassie's character not. Felt like borrowed creative ideas from Star Wars (bar & fight scenes) and Shark Boy & Lavagirl (MODOK). Graphics failed miserably w recent release of Avatar Way of Water and even Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness.Really, Kang and all of his identities are frightened by Ant Man killing Kang in one realm... when they have the ability to prune and change the (one) timeline? Seems like a simple fix. Kang needs a worthy opponents in multiple realms... America Chavez, Dr Strange, Scarlet Witch, even Thanos, and could bring back Iron Man, Capt America & Black Widow. I dunno, Kang threat should be the combined result of Loki, Thanos, and other accidental/planned occurrences... across different realms. One where Thanos wins, kills Kang in that realm, and causes vengeance from other realms. Another where Tony Stark brings back banished Kang to Quantum realm after he was killed by other Kang's. Scarlett Witch tampered w realms which had larger causal effects to slang. You get the idea.Where are the innovative and creative writers at Disney/Marvel that can write an engaging, innovative and very creative plot and intertwined storyline around Marvel characters? Present your absolute BEST work, not mediocre!Sorry, movie only okay to watch on streaking service. Visuals and sound didn't warrant a theatre experience. Hugely disappointed."
6," The fall
",codjer,/user/ur162460164/,18 February 2023,"Unfortunately, Marvel couldn't do better than other MCU movies. They just do the bare minimum and even for some it wasn't enough to get a good movie. It was not up to our expectations. The one who failed to save the film despite the excellent acting Jonathan Majors but who gives us a very good performance in the role of Kang and he will do very well in his future within the MCU. I criticize the movie ant man for being often just a big post credit scene for upcoming movies for example ant man 1 it was civil war, ant man and the wasp the quantum realm for endgame and quantumania for avenger the kang dynasti. Besides, speaking of the wasp, I'm not even sure I heard it speak during the film 20 replies top. And Hank Pym and are armed with ant so old. The film is also very long 2h04 you tell me it's not that long but when everything goes too fast and the scenes are cut and you don't understand much it becomes bad. Despite everything it is not to be avoided, it is an acceptable entertainment which puts the next big villain in the lead, it can make you laugh but without doing without realizing it. If you like marvel like me go see it but if you have no interest boycott it."
7," Good Start for phase 5
",dfernandes-66180,/user/ur97671142/,18 February 2023,"I definitely liked the movie, honestly don't know the critics and some people are giving bad reviews, it's not that great as I thought, but it's okay to watch the first time Kang as enemy and honestly Jonathan Majors stole the show he is a great actor and I was amazed by his acting as Kang the Conqueror, Cassie is a lovely character, for me it's a good start to the phase 5, the ending was a bit different from what I was expecting but that's okay, the cgi is great compared to other Marvel Movies, a disappointment on Modok I think he should be as the comic and not a weak character and what they did to him, a nice movie to watch, don't go to the theater expecting too much or you'll be disappointed, and yes this definitely is connected directly to Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, in my opinion I really enjoyed this movie."
3," Lots of Potential, but ran out of gas mid-flight and off trajectory
",imsulzer,/user/ur156472283/,18 February 2023,"Based off of the trailers, I was hooked and ready to see this film, especially with ""the conqueror"" being mentioned endlessly over and over again, and the amount of fear that was built up from 2 years ago with Season 1 of Loki.The day comes, 2 hours go by, and I am shaking my fists and pounding my head wondering what is this dumpster fire of a movieScott or Cassie were suppose to die... but they didn't. This intro film needed an ""Infinity War"" tragic death vibe to it, but it was like watching kids fight in a ball pitInstead, you get endless forced ""happy good feeling"" moments. Everything feels too good to be true, cringly, I mean... Kevin Feige .... wtf were you thinking with this? What killed me the most... was when kang says ""YoU tAlK To AnTs?!??!?!?!?"" and then Hank Pym standing there with a dumb smirk on his face with thousands of hyper advanced ants (which with the help of a desperate MODOK who wants to redeem himself, a killing machine that has worse aim than a Stormtrooper in Star Wars), takes down the guy who kills endless amounts of avengers... too easy....And Hope saving Scott from being killed by Kang... that was dumb... forced scriptIf the multiverse was a real thing. The script SHOULD of been Kang KILLING either Cassie or Scott. Kang ""dies"" the same way he did by hope..... Tragic ending... in the later film few years down the line, when the multi-verse is falling apart, whoever lived in Quantumania (Scott for example, Cassie Dies) meets the alternate reality (Where Cassie Lives and Scott is murdered IN front of her by Kang) and THEN those damaged characters reunite and have a new appreciation, growth and feeling.... NOW THAT would be perfect.... but nope...Lots of Potential...terrible CGI... rushed... and Bill Murray.... you will always be the Goat... but what happened."
7," Better than expected - 7.5/10
",matt_zilla-00996,/user/ur63434597/,18 February 2023,"After reading some of the reviews, I have to say, I went into the theater with low expectations, but this really delivered and then some, IMO. I'm not sure where all the hate is coming from, especially with people saying the graphics were bad, or that Marvel is only doing ""quantity over quality"" right now, which couldn't be further from reality - people are just complaining to complain.The story line was slow in the beginning, but the rest of the movie was great. This wound up being a great introduction to Kang, and some of the graphics were very captivating. I couldn't be more excited for the upcoming Marvel releases, especially the next phase of Avenger's."
2," Marvel is going to fail at this rate
",etawns,/user/ur61210325/,18 February 2023,It's honestly sad to see marvel becoming a broken franchise. Bit by bit quality has worsened and they really just don't care about what makes marvel great. This movie was truly bad. Thr pace felt rushed and in un even and not a single joke landed. The script felt like it was written in one sitting my the input of 50 different people all wanting to have some crappy input. The only redeeming factor was that there were some talented artists and creatives that must have worked on it. Alot of people and fans have invested so much into this franchise and it's honestly sad to see it crumble. Edgar write had the right idea in leaving marvel when he did. There's too many cooks and there all wanting paid.
2," So hard to watch
",danionme,/user/ur86722536/,18 February 2023,"The acting and humor in the movie felt forced and some of the jokes were inappropriate. Additionally, there were some parts of the plot that didn't make much sense or were difficult to believe. While I understand that it's fiction, it's still important to create a sense of believability within the story. For example, during the scene where the characters are being sucked into the quantum realm, it would have made more sense for them to use their powers to protect themselves or their loved ones. Overall, while I personally didn't enjoy this movie, I believe it's important to express criticism in a constructive and respectful way that doesn't attack others or their opinions."
6," It was okay
",ifroonaryok,/user/ur146893341/,18 February 2023,"It was okay. I expected too much after the stunning experience from Loki. But don't get me wrong, Jonathan Major did a fantastic job as Kang, love him. Kang is a worthy new big badie for the Multiverse Saga and Jonathan Majors is amazing. But the plot just doesn't seem that great. It could've been improved upon. And while it's not short at 1 hour and 50, I wish it was longer because I want to see more of Kang. Also, weird they recast Cassie Lang but I think I like Kathryn Newton as Cassie.But this isn't my final review. I may have a change of opinions after a re-watch once it comes out on Disney+."
10," Awesome, i love it, phase five begun with a masterpiece.
",anasrafique-59355,/user/ur111091649/,18 February 2023,"My spoiler free review of Ant-man & the Wasp: Quantumania. The headlines read ""Quantamania joins Eternals as the 2nd rotten MCU film!"" but the thing is, I like eternals.Let's talk visuals. If you watch this movie and think ""M. O. D. O. K. Looks so stupid!"", well I'm here to tell you...he's always looked stupid. There was no way to ""do him justice"" in live action. So just lower your expectations for him right now. Moving onto the quantum realm, I always found it stunningly beautiful in its own way. I think given the unknown nature of the quantum realm, the visual efx artists really had a blank canvas to play around with so we got to see a lot of original characters.Which brings me to my main gripe with the movie. Outside of the main protagonists and Kang, all the characters felt really flat. They run into a ragtag group of aliens rebelling against Kang and their entire personalities were ""we must defeat Kang!"" which like...yeah but give me a reason to care about these people. I can't even tell you any of their names.WOW did Majors knock it out of the park! I mean if you're wondering if Thanos can be topped as the big bad of the MCU, Kang is your answer. He's not just a threat to this world, but the entire multiverse itself. Scott was outclassed and outgunned.Also, I'm so glad that they gave Michele Pfeiffer something to do. They were really dropping the ball by not giving a founding avenger any kind of story or goal in the previous movies. Newcomer Kathryn Newton's Cassie Lang is my hero. Of all the younger heroes introduced in phase four, she's the only one sure of her role to become a hero. I could see her leading a young avengers team.Overall, the stakes were high enough to keep your attention and the action was satisfying. While I don't generally take issue with humor in my superhero movies, this one took the less is more option and it worked. 10/10."
9," A movie worth watching post Endgame
",kiomarsnu,/user/ur22798009/,18 February 2023,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. Post Endgame this is the first MCU movie that has a good story, action, drama and a lot of weird aliens - I hope Marvel makes movies about the events in quantum realm. Honestly I had high hopes for Wakanda Forever BUT I couldn't watch 2/3 of it. Half way I was so bored that I had to leave. Quantumania wastes no time and immediately gets into the actual story and action. The jokes are a bit flat, but they don't ruin the experience. I think this is one of the best Ant-man and Wasp movies, and I can't wait to watch it again on Disney plus platform when it is available for streaming."
9," Phase Snore is over. Phase 5 is alive!
",safeatbase,/user/ur121155816/,18 February 2023,"I was worried after hearing about initial mixed reviews and Quantumania being the second lowest scoring MCU film, but the critics were wrong - dead wrong. Quantumania is MCU's ode to Star Wars fun and it really works. The Ant-Man style of comedy is still there even though the stakes are much higher with the arrival of Kang the Conqueror who Jonathan Majors masterfully made the quintessence of intimidation and menace. Marvel made the best choice casting him as the next saga's big bad because his range, expression, and delivery are nonpareil. This guy is raw acting talent.A lot could have gone wrong with Quantumania. Like most of Phase 4, it could have gone too far and still have felt all for nothing. But it was the right amount of lunacy and imagination. The only stretch is MODOK. Yeah, everyone will no doubt agree the movie could've done without him and that he's undeniably the worst thing about the movie. Every scene he's in is so distracting and cringey. Only his last few ""brother"" and ""Avenger"" lines were tolerable - really funny actually. And while the script definitely suffered from spots of juvenile jests that I don't think even kids would find funny, all in all it still did a good job concisely giving backstories and delivering heart-felt moments between Scott and Cassie - the core characters of the story.Paul Rudd still rocks as Ant-Man. His comedic chops and timing always make him so entertaining to watch. Marvel can stop with his solo movies and throw him into every other film for buddy-com action and improve every movie. It would never get old.And I'll just say for the woke-watchers...there's no agenda of any sort in this movie. The swearing is even dialed back a lot especially compared to the last few MCU films. It's definitely more family entertainment."
9," More than say
",matheusgarces,/user/ur157713563/,18 February 2023,"Some people will say that Kang is too weak, and that's true (that's a bad part), however, we must remember that only 2 years from now that Kang dynasty will be released, for sure the character Kang will become much stronger. Having said that the film is adventure but not silly, it has jokes as expected from Ant Man, this is not a problem, also Spider man makes jokes and it is not a problem. Kang's story with Jannet is pretty good (one of the best parts of the movie). Jonathan majors acts perfectly. *The film has two post credits scenes in the first one several Kang's appear including Ramatut. In the second scene we have a scene from season 2 of Loki with a version of Kang in the past."
7," Could have been a little better
",Roscorox616,/user/ur162458231/,18 February 2023,"The movie isn't as bad as people say and it definitely is better than most of the movies we've seen in phase 4. The story was too simple that focussed heavily on setting up future projects, rather giving more focus to the characters.Jonathan Majors nailed his role as Kang and the visuals were stunning. However, it appears Marvel hasn't learnt anything from their usual formula of forced humour, as this movie had quite a lot, even in scenes that didn't require it.Overall, its a good film to watch in theatres for the visual representation and for the post-credits scene. It is a great Ant-Man movie, but a not great Marvel movie."
5," What happened to you Marvel???
",farthing-55458,/user/ur62685924/,18 February 2023,"Me and my two boys 18 & 15 were excited to check this one out, but let me tell you, we all left extremely underwhelmed. Walking out to the car my boys were literally laughing at the movie, and said, ""Dad, we're done with Marvel!"" The movie didn't have the Antman comedy that we're all used to. It was definitely missing PeÃ±a!!! He adds so much to the Antman stories and movies. The quantum realm was a bit of a joke. Marvel/Disney seems like they're making this stuff up as they go and very poorly at that. Kang, is not a menacing villain at al lol IMO, he doesn't come across as a threat at all. The characters seemed very wooden in this installment, I don't know. It just felt off...Throwing Bill Murray in it as a cameo made it even more of a joke, and not a good one. I was expecting so much more. This movie felt like Tron, Starwars, Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor Ragnorok all in one. Those movies separately worked but throwing a collection of all them into one movie felt way off. I actually dozed off at one point myself. This movie didn't develop Kang, Janet all of sudden has all these secrets of the Quantum realm??? Darren became M. O. D. O. K??? This movie was bad on so many levels. Antman now doesn't even pass out after becoming big??? I don't know what else to say, I was not impressed at all! Best part of this movie was the second credits scene promising Season 2 of LOKI!!!"

",astylianou-46696,/user/ur134305222/,18 February 2023,"Where are we? In the medieval times? The plot is all over the place compared to other movies of the MCU, the director and the cast have done a great job in portraying their characters, but the backstory of the quantum world and the main villain of was short and for those which did not watch Loki and the entirety of the MCU movies or other Ant Man fils was hard to follow. Also the main villain was portrayed as someone invincible by the heroes which possessed little power compared to his however the end showed his power very little as to what was shown in the beginning. Set the way for the rest of the movies though. Also good humour as always. But, you are these guys."
6," The reason this movie isn't great:
",codologyinc,/user/ur93577895/,18 February 2023,"The writers (and characters) are afraid of getting to the point. They hold it off and hold it off, constantly cutting back and forth from one group to another in order to buy some more time to not spill the beans.Further problem: the beans to be spilled? Are obvious. The audience already knows what Janet/the writers are hiding. It makes the movie a slog.Also... WHY DOES NOBODY KEEP THEIR DAMN HELMETS ON?!?!?!The visual style is Star Wars. At least they did better with the cgi than Thor Love and Thunder.The soundtrack might as well have not existed. Possibly the least compelling mcu soundtrack ever."

Sure, it's not the best and it's not near endgames level, but that was 10 years in the making. Nothing is.If you were to compare Quantumania to any non-avengers film, it holds up solid.It has good acting, funny delivery, exciting pace and a new character that could rival Korg on comedy.While watching the film, I enjoyed it and thought it was good. Now that the screening is over, I just want to watch it again.Good post-credit sceneS too. MCU might well be back."

",judsondmyers,/user/ur152726550/,18 February 2023,"This was so much fun! Where can you go after the multiverse, the quantum realm of course. I have to give it to Marvel cuz they stay finding great creative new dimensions. I also love that a lot of these are real scientific theories. I felt like this is what all the prior Ant-mans were building up to, and it delivered.The acting was great Paul Rudd is always solid but but Jonathan Majors (Kang), Michael Douglas, and Michelle Phifer stole the show for me. When I see this list a superhero movie is not what I'd expect to see them in together.The plot was pretty basic but you can tell it was an introduction to the Quantum Realm and Kang. It's implied both will be returning in future movie. I really enjoyed the humor throughout. I heard they hired one of the Rick and Morty writes and it payed off if you like that type of humor.The visual effects were stunning and seemless. I really enjoyed seeing it in 3D which added great clen depth in the important parts. Definitely a lot of eye candy and beautifully trippy scenery.The only thing that I would improve on would be some of the lazy camera work and or CGI. The background was out of focus a lot, I always like it when they then change focus to the back sometimes to switch it up. And lacked any noticeable artsy cinematography. It did feel a little rushed and lacked the finishing to make it a masterpiece. The 3D was lazy during non action scenes. I feel like if Marvel spaced out their movies just a little further they would have time to add the small extra bit of refinement this film needed.All and all it was an amazing beautiful, funny, fun movie and very entertaining. It's a great introduction to the Quantum Realm and Kang and can't wait to see where it goes! I'm giving it a 10 because I think it's being underrated as a whole. I get it won't be everybody's cup of tea but in a perfect world this movies deserves a 7.2 rating."
7," Jonathan Majors!
",ggclermont,/user/ur97380195/,18 February 2023,"Majors is outstanding as Kang. He embodies mystery, brokenness and relentlessness. I am definitely going to view the movie again just to experience the magic of his character. I understand why viewers might be frustrated, though. It's unfair for one character/actor to carry the whole movie. The other characters were either not as well-written, interesting or as well-acted out as Kang. Script and storyline were okay. Pace was good. A few awkward moments particularly toward the end. But really Jonathan Majors stole the whole show. I look forward to seeing him reprise his role in the MCU in future years. Give him an award!"
9," UNDERRATED
",rayanbose,/user/ur108315143/,18 February 2023,"Sure the ""critiques"" will say this movie is a bore and an absolute dissapointment but the movie suggested otherwise. This is not some sort of art film which is supposed to make us woo out of emotion neither is it john wick that the action should surpass its predecessor as a must. It's an extremely enjoyable movie and a stellar introduction to Kang, who is arguably much, much, MUCH more powerful dynamic and arguably intriguing than Thanos and a good addition to the mcu. Judging this as a movie alone would do it no justice unless seen as an introduction to phase 5.EXTREMELY ENJOYABLE.The movie peaks your interest about the future to follow as all movies in thr franchise must. It would justify to say that after returning home I sudden had this childish urge to watch all mcu productions over again. That's how intriguing it really is. It's not exactly the Mozart or Beethoven of films but it does put a smile on your face and puts a piece into the puzzle, while teasing about the rest."

",looking_Work,/user/ur25846153/,18 February 2023,"This movie can be worth watching if you follow these steps:
1) Get plenty of rest before you see it as act 1 is boring as $#!t
2) Remember that you are watching Ant-Man and not Star Wars. It's in Act 2 where things get interesting.3) The beginning is the time to use the restroom. There are some interesting things that happen in Act 3 later on but for the most part the Marvel formula is present.4) There are 2 after credit scenes. The first is the best (as I am a fan of the comics). The second, I don't know what the hype is about (as I am not a fan of Disney+)MODOK cgi sucked. You may have to go to a physician afterwards for 'blue screen fatigue'. Yes, they have to do it as the scenes cannot be replicated inexpensively in the real world, but there is a clear lack of emotion from the actors as they are not interacting with an environment when they are shooting a scene.The humor has been tamped down which was a pleasant surprise. Subliminal activist messaging was present but not pervasive.Overall, not as bad as I thought it would be but not as good as it could have been."

Paul Rudd never really seems to age, but he brings just the right amount of comedy, innocence, wonder back into the MCU.The stoyline starts the journey into Phase 5 which will end with Avengers Secret Wars. New Characters have been introduced and the version of Kang the Conqueror has just the right amount of menace without being comic book over the top, nothing to over the top and Jonathan Majors plays the role brilliantly and you come away wanting to know more of this versions back-story."

One important thing that this movie carry about they give proper job for supporting characters but missed three buddies of Scoot. You know whom I talking about. VFX and CGI was good but not up to the mark. It may have improved if they have given time. Introduction of Daddy Kang was biggest responsibility that this carried out and I am satisfied with that. But movie took my heart in last post credit and I was like i wanted more in that scene. Over all I love this movie as always like antman first and second part does."

But hey, I've seen bad movies in my life, and this third installment of Ant-Man is definitely not one of them.It introduces Kang, and Kang is cool, check. Many to anticipate for that one in the future. M. O. D. O. K steals the show, check. Every time he's on screen you'll have at least a little giggle. It is very ""star wars""-like, check. It's a movie about a conqueror stuck in a quantum realm filled with quantum people, you connect the dots. Michelle Pfeifer and Katherine Newton live up the movie, check. They are refreshments and they look-like they've been hanging around in the MCU from the very start.So all of those are good things. Even on top of that, it's an every routine Ant-Man movie, where Paul Rudd is funny, heist things are cooking-up, he grows big, he turns small, full of smacking and kicking, and that just adds up the fun. There are no need to worry about anything turning bitter and hateful. Just go to the movies and throw your money at it. I even liked this more than Thor 4 and Dr. Strange 2."
7," Yeah, I adore comics.
",BandSAboutMovies,/user/ur69172350/,18 February 2023,"As a kid, I read and re-read Marvel Premiere #47, which showed how Scott Lang became Ant-Man. Written by David Michelinie and drawn by X-Men team of teams John Byrne and Terry Austin, it was a story I read and re-read and if you have ever seen the way I draw comic books, so much of it comes from this issue.So when it comes to that whole ""Are comics cinema?"" back and forth argument, I think you can figure out what side I'm on. Are there too many comic book movies? Were there too many giallo from 1970-1975? Did Italy make too many Westerns? Were there too many slashers in 1981? Can there be too much of something that you love?Alright, now that I have gotten past the legally required nod to serious criticism, let me tell you why I enjoyed this movie about humanoid broccoli.After the Avengers save everything from Thanos, former criminal and current Avenger Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has settled down from being Ant-Man, instead enjoying life as a writer, husband of Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and father of Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), who is upset that her father isn't fighting for people any longer, instead enjoying the fruits of his hard work and resting on his laurels. There's a moment that's interesting here, as she discusses all the people who were displaced in the time where Thanos killed half of reality and now are homeless. Yes, it'd be great to explore this but this is a popcorn movie that soon moves past that; I'm not suggesting a popcorn movie delve into that, but hey, if there ends up being a Disney+ D-Man series that does, I'd watch that. Also, the fact that I just casually namedropped D-Man should explain why I never went to the prom.Anyways, Cassie has been working with her stepmother Hope and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to communicate with the Quantum Realm, the place where Hank's wife Janey Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) spent thirty years of her life and has no interest in going back, particularly when it comes to explaining her past or unleashing new Marvel Cinematic Universe big bad Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors, who is quite frankly amazing in this movie and brings a real sense of big drama to his role, not to mention all the various - oh yeah, SPOILER WARNING, I forgot that legal disclaimer -versions of Kang that he shows off, including Immortus, Rama-Tut, Scarlet Centurion and Victor Timely).Everyone soon gets pulled into that Quantum Realm and becomes part of the war between its inhabitants, with good rebels Jentorra (Katy O'Brian, who was already part of the MCU as Kimball in Marvel's Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D., as well as Major Sarah Grey in the DC superhero TV series Black Lightning and a comms officer on The Mandalorian; if you really want me to go full geek, she's a member of former Micronauts leader Commander Arcturus Rann's Enigma Force alongside other non-Mego owned characters Marionette and Bug; one more semicolon but man, this movie is as close as we're ever getting to a Michael Golden-era Micronauts movie), telepathic Quaz (William Jackson Harper; he's not Quasar, as many Marvel fans thought, but when he does pull a password out of someone's mind at one point, it's 18147, which would be Avengers #181, Scott Lang's first appearance, and a shout out to the aforementioned Marvel Premiere #47), the slime creature with no holes named Veb (David Dastmalchian, who was Kurt in the last two Ant-Man movies, Abra Kadabra on The Flash and Polka Dot Man in Suicide Squad), the flashlight head Xolum (James Cutler) and oh yeah, there's Bill Murray as Lando Calrissian (I kid, he's Lord Krylar, another of the characters like Jentorra who come from K'ai, the microplanet where the Hulk met one of the loves of his life Jarella) battling Kang and his Tron: Legacy-looking soldiers like he's Baron Karza or something.Anyways, yes, this all feels rather like Star Wars but then again isn't Star Wars influenced if not ripped off from Jack Kirby's Fourth World? Kirby invented most of the MCU and rebelling against a dark authority is pretty much an archetype. Where this gets kind of operatic is that Ant-Man is, well, an ant against space god Kang and that's a battle that I never saw coming.I also never thought I'd see MODOK (Machine Organism Designed Only for Killing) in a movie, much less one that fully embraces the absolutely goofy idea of a giant head in a chair with weapons and baby legs. Also, this ends up being former Yellowjacket Darren Cross from the first movie and every time his real face shows up, it breaks the movie but it's a welcome break in the movie.You can imagine - and you'd be right - that the good guys win but this movie brings up an interesting idea that you can't just punch Kang, who lives his life across multiple timelines that are not linear and that this Kang may not be the worst of the many Kangs. Then Scott brushes it off and tries to enjoy some Baskin-Robbins ice cream cake (the fact that the ice cream chain has no tie-in flavor and yet had a Condorman flavor back in the 80s is kind of upsetting).In the same way that politics - nice socialism shoutout with the ants in this - just leads to people not listening to one another, a lot of folks have their minds made up about comic book movies which are really just mythology and should be seen as such. That said, this movie did what all popcorn films should: it entertained me. I think it's hilarious that one of the film's writers, Jeff Loveness, said that this movie is ""Jodorowsky's Dune within Marvel"" and there are not enough drugs in the world to show you what Alejandro Jodorowsky would do with a Marvel film but hey, he also did The Incal in comics form, so when you denigrate comics, keep in mind that a hero of cinema spent so much of his time there.I explained to my wife tonight that as a kid, there I never really wanted to get involved in human drama or how stressful some extended family members could be, so I just filled my life with comic books. Often when we talk on the phone, my mom will say, ""Do you remember this person,"" and the answer is no, I do not remember this person. However, if she asked, ""Was Wolverine really in World War 2?"" I could give her several anecdotes and explain how Black Widow could be young and yet still saved by Logan and Captain America in 1941.So yeah, I liked this movie."
7," Decent Story, weird execution.
",Vamskye,/user/ur122210194/,18 February 2023,"Quantumania was a very weird movie, & that's in a good sense. The movie is jam-packed with humor & action. The movie immediately delves into the Quantum Realm without wasting a second. The visual effects are amazing for most of the parts but, some parts were just god awful to look at.Talking about characters, Kang 100% carried the movie. Janet played an equally important role. Scott & Wasp were equally amazing. Kathryn Newton had some good moments but some of her line deliveries & dialogues were just cringe.MODOK & Quaz were wasted. They could've done so much with their characters. There's few clichÃ©s, which everyone could've seen it coming. It's obvious that they were plotting a different ending & it was changed in the reshoots. And of-course, some cringe dialogues.However, the strongest factor of this movie for me, was the plot. Decent story, weird execution."
7," Obvious Storyline
",satyajittsoren,/user/ur103203343/,18 February 2023,"The movie sets up the future of MCU but as an individual story it's not that great. The storyline is too obvious and no elements of suprise & twist. From acting point of view the movie looses its string on emotional pov, especially the father - daughter chemistry of Scott & Cassy. Acting of Jonathan Majors is on point, just what you expect from a such high profile actor.The world building of Quantum realm is gorgeous. Good camera work & direction. The action scenes are good but the side characters are got shadowed.Overall an one time watch. The movie has 2 post credit scenes and both are important for future."
10," Unnecesary Hate
",drepm_sonics,/user/ur136222381/,18 February 2023,"Not every movie of marvel needs to be like Endgame, for me was a normal and good movie of Marvel Studios, kinda funny like every AntMan movie, very surprised of the two post credits scenes, and this version of Kang is awesome. A good M. O. D. O. K by the way, people don't know who M. O. D. O. K is or what?If you want to watch the movie, watch it, don't listen what the people say about it, a good movie to watch with the family and a good way to start the Phase 5, those moments where you think something will happen actually they don't happen, the plot twist in some moments and the final is by far, incredible."
8," Really Solid!
",matthensonaa,/user/ur162451150/,18 February 2023,"As simply an Ant-Man movie i found this film to be very very solid and i think it did Kang the Conqueror a lot of justice. I am very much looking forward to his return and the arrival of his variants. It also is just such a visually stimulating experience. I felt tonally it was pretty decently balanced but as most of marvel's movies go there's never enough action in my opinion (given it is just ant-man i know but still). I feel like the comedic sections weren't too overused and overall the acting was much more serious as it needed to be, which i really liked. Overall as a film i'm giving it an 8 as it was very enjoyable and is a setup of future movies to come which will crave that itch for more Kang to come. The film isn't nothing too crazy or anything over the top but it's definitely something you shouldn't skip on."
9," Just need more Wasp please
",broshrimp,/user/ur94832816/,18 February 2023,"I had a good time with this film. Beautiful skyboxes, Rudd being funny, Lilly being sexy. Majors as Kang is vicious and terrifying, Ant Man really makes the hero turn in this film leading into Phase 5 and 6, with guest appearances by Stinger and M. O. D. O. K.. Really has a 5-8 issue comic book arc feel, jumping right into the action, while managing to do a lot of world building. I only wish there was more Wasp action in this film, but there was enough. Can never get enough an og leader of the Avengers though. Can't wait to see more Ant Man vs Kang.9.5/10 for me

1," Probably the worst Marcel so far
",Cread-550-158794,/user/ur38401422/,18 February 2023,"Marvel at it's worst and judging by their latest run of Marvel movies that's saying something. It was so bad it was laughable and that wasn't the feeble attempts at comedy. The acting was wooden especially the unconvincing baddie. The story was the usual American teen flick style in a Marvel setting. It was a bad mix of Star wars Honey I shrunk the kids. A floating head that reminded me of Holly from Red Dwarf and Spaceballs.We stayed for the end credits, stupidly, and saw the first one. We wish we didn't as it looks like it's setting up a franchise for Kang the Conqueror films. Help. We couldn't take another end credit scene and left.Come on Marvel with all your money in the bank pay for some decent script writers, some actors with credibility and create a decent film. Or are we going to get a reboot of Horward the duck."
5," MCU isn't considerate of the audience anymore
",Tanmay_Garg,/user/ur93367335/,18 February 2023,"The last good movie to come out of the MCU was 2 years ago (Shang-Chi in 2021). It's just really disappointing to see them have so much potential and not being able to execute even the simplest of storylines.Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors were the only good thing happening throughout the whole 2 hours of that garbage. They carried the whole thing on their barebacks.The real problem revolving around the MCU is that they hype things to such an extent that even if they know they have produced a very mediocre film it cannot back off from the expectations of that very hyped audience and just expect us to see any dumb material that they have created.I would have to admit that the CGI and VFX part were on point but without a storyline it wasn't enough to create interest in the minds of the viewers.The plot was so slow that I thought I could just doze off for 10-15 minutes and still pickup from where I left.How they massacred the legendary character of MODOK, I don't even want to talk about it.Like any other film, this too stereotyped the role of the female lead as an accessory of love and hope to the male protagonist even though it is titled 'Ant-man and the WASP'. Likewise, Cassie (as a character) was left way far from the whole of it.But as always the mid-credit and post-credit scenes were something of their own (I would say the only admirable part of the picture) leaving the all of us in awe.All in all, I am rating it 5/10 with 2 stars just the macho men who made me sit throughout the movie. MCU can do better, like a whole lot better."
4," Less than average movie, close to B type
",wahn06,/user/ur47747361/,18 February 2023,"MCU is dead. It is official. They can't produce any good movie anymore. It would be a safe bet to not watch their upcoming movies as they will involve this lethargic concept of multi-verse. How much of the same thing with the only difference of theme can people keep watching?About this movie, the story is meh, full of cliches, and the plot is quite predictable. It is nothing like the first ant-man movie.Animations are overdone, very flashy sometimes and not good for weak eyes. They aren't beautiful either.Only save here is the acting by senior actors.Verdict: save your money and time. Don't watch."
7," Not a bad movie, disappointing ending
",gxdgpqw,/user/ur158045212/,18 February 2023,"I had some expectations for this movie because of the menacing villain the trailer and comics portray.Was very disappointed to have a bad ending to movie that had too much potential. The first 30 minutes are kind of rough to get through but after the movie isn't great, but isn't bad as a lot of critics portray I was scared that it was gonna be worse because of all the people exaggerating that this movie is not the best, and sadly that it didn't live up to its potential I think the Jonathan mayors as kang was the best thing from this movie. And I enjoyed the small jokes that were told and some funny parts in the movie. Overall, I give it a seven out of 10 by think it's kind of forgettable but not a bad movie."
5," Kang was terrifying that's it
",mranan,/user/ur115836155/,18 February 2023,"This movie does a big heavy lifting for other franchises and this lead to a loss of focus , now I kind of understand where everything is going but this movie was something that is much about Kang than about Scott lang and as well as I can say rick and morty writers should be fired from marvel , they don't understand main characters and just doesn't develop the characters at all , you can develop Cassie lang but why don't you develop ant man as a hero just like Tony stark and captain America was. This movie is like if during infinity war saga there was a movie about character and instead of focusing on that character you focus on infinity stone how it was forged and came , you could have named this movie Kang and ant man just like you could have scarlet witch in madness for Doctor strange 2."
8," Discover the Quantum Realm like never before!
",rickytisme,/user/ur97162544/,18 February 2023,"We've seen the Quantum Realm in the Marvel Universe before, but not like this. The inhabitants and all of the characters, including the blobs and the mind reader are very cool.Awesome science-fiction action, adventure chapter with a fantastic story. The humor is good and not overdone.Great cast but Jonathan Majors portrayal of Kang the Conqueror is predictable and only goes skin deep. It just seems like he is trying too hard to be cool but he just can't quite pull it off.Marvel fans will enjoy this entertaining installment of the MCU and the Ant-Man series. Don't listen to the Siskel and Ebert wannabes, review this one for yourself.Looking forward to Loki Season 2 and phase 5!"
8," Another introduction movie
",super_kjeld,/user/ur70458681/,18 February 2023,"This movie is fun and has some good bombastic action scenes. Kang is portrayed very well, however we might need more of a backstory in the future. The science fiction world for me had some Star Wars vibes. The main cast also did a good job, they are funny but not Thor L&T level over the top. But it also shows the power of these underrated avengers. What I don't like is that every MCU movie is now an introduction movie of someone new. We need a movie which ties some of the Phase 4 together, it is such a mess with all those open plot lines... And when we see the next movies on the horizon this will not change in the near future."
8," A family entertainer
",mohammedhisham-16957,/user/ur162448100/,18 February 2023,"First of all, the visuals deserve a really good praise. Especially the quantum realm visuals and CGI was breathtaking.Jonathan Majors killed it with his performance as Kang. He is the next bad daddy villain after our beloved Thanos. This movie kick starts phase four perfectly.The amount of hate this movie is getting is genuinely stupid given how this was one of the better movies Marvel has put out recently. This movie does have some negatives to it mostly just consisting of some cringey dialogue and some actors not really selling the characters for me but in the grand scheme of the film it really didn't bother me that much. The humour is actually not too bad, definitely some lines which felt abit unnecessary at times but I did find myself laughing a decent bit throughout the film (mostly at MODOK, everytime he appears on screen you cannot help but laugh). I feel with the time they were given on this picture the CGI is very impressive given as they couldn't go to the Quantum Realm to film and they didn't have 11 years to work on this like Avatar did. This movie did do a good job at setting up what's to come with this new phase but at the expense of side-lining it's main characters and they're arcs - so do not expect to come out of this film crying because there really aren't that many scenes that will get you emotional. Paul Rudd and Michael Douglas were fine in this movie, nothing special they played their part and they did it good. Evangeline Lilly was heavily underused but whatever scenes she had she was fine. Kathryn Newton didn't really sell it for me as Cassie but her dynamic with Paul Rudd was entertaining but she can come off sort of cringey at times. But the real takeaway from this movie was the performances of Jonathon Majors and Michelle Pfeifer. Janet as a character I sometimes found more entertaining than Antman and the Wasp themselves, I found her connection with the Quantum Realm interesting and she definitely gave one of the better performances of this movie. But the real MVP of this movie was Kang, I actually felt for what a great interpretation in which Majors delivers he was so under-utilised and I wanted to see so much more of what Kang was capable of and how much of a threat he would be to our next Avengers line-up. The overall feel of the movie can come off as a little messy with some rushed parts in there, I definitely believe the movie itself would've benefited from an extra 20-30 minutes for character growth and arcs to be fulfilled but I really did think this was an enjoyable cinema experience. The mid credit scene is very impactful on this next phase no matter how goofy it can come across at times and the post credit scene I don't feel is a must-watch unless you've been caught up the disney+ shows in which it is a fun tease at something to come. In conclusion this is not a terrible movie nor is it perfect it's definitely a solid 7.5 maybe 8 out of 10 for me. I recommend giving it a watch to base your own opinion on it but I still remain hopeful for whatever Marvel is planning with this next saga."
7," Don't believe the Critics, Audience knows best
",moviemanmo,/user/ur161226852/,18 February 2023,"The introduction into the Quantum realm really gave me Star Wars vibes and I would say that's a good thing. The character designs were great. The plot and backstory for why things were happening was explained well and easy to follow. All the characters from the previous films played their roles well.As far as new characters, Kang was excellent. Though he didn't show off too much of his powers. I wasn't expecting him to so I wasn't disappointed. I would say towards the end, the film did make him seem a bit weak. Great character played by a great actor nonetheless.Modok could have been better. His initial look was fine but once his true identity was revealed that's when he looked weird. They could have done with working on that CGI or not show that version of him that many times once they showed who he truly was. He was used too much for comedic relief and towards the end it was a bit much.The action in the film was entertaining but nothing over the top.The dialogue and forced comedy towards the end is what brings this movie down a bit. There were bits of dialogue/scenes that could have been taken out and the film would have been much stronger. Specifically from Modok and Ant-man's daughter and like one line from Kang.Overall it was another entertaining Ant-man movie that didn't disappoint. Don't believe the Critics, enjoy the film."
8," A great start to the Kang Dynasty
",egortwitch,/user/ur162447603/,18 February 2023,"I watched this movie! I can say that Ant's triquel was a success, I don't understand why critics scold him so much, now in order what I liked and what I didn't like
1)Scott and Cassie, there is a Father-daughter chemistry between them, they save the world together and that makes me happy.2) Janet and Hank, they are not the most central characters here, but they also play a role in the film, there is such a frame in the film with Hank, he is very funny. Janet, as a narrator, tells half of the film about everything and it pleases that the film has an explanation for almost everything!3) Kang, it's not for nothing that he is a CONQUEROR, Jonathan Majers, he just shines in this film, his voice, his facial expressions, his goal is to conquer something, and destroy something completely! His canonical costume is just fire! They finally managed to make a cool villain who will come back, and I think more than once.4) Modok is a cool guy, he puts himself up as a cool guy with guns up his sleeve, he has a funny face, I won't say anything more.5) Graphics, what about graphics, and there is a lot of it in this film, and I am glad that it is finished and there are no flaws in the graphics
6) Living beings, well, or residents of the Quantum realm, they also stood out very well, everyone has their own costume and they are also so cute and brave!Well, the minuses of this movie!(ALL THE MINUSES THAT ARE WRITTEN HERE, THIS IS PURELY MY OPINION!!!)
1) There are several dialogues in the film, well, they are very stupid, they are just too long and I just want to reduce them to a minimum
2) In my opinion, there was very little Kang, it seems to me that such a powerful villain should be given more time on the screen.3) Hope, what's wrong with her? She just walks the whole movie, and does nothing to promote the plot, she's just like butter on bread.I may not have written everything here, but you can watch this movie at least once! In short, the film at one time is no more.The scenes after the credits just shock you, they are so cool you need to look at them in cinemas, be sure to stay until the end of the session!My rating:
8/10."
4," Extremely Disappointing - Could have been more
",imperialwalkrnyr,/user/ur48226477/,18 February 2023,"While Antman & the Wasp May not be the worst Marvel movie; it is definitely the most disappointed I've been this far.The stakes were set and I spent days beforehand trying to figure out how Antman would make it out of this alive. I was ready for loss. That Infinity War like surprise of defeat...Unfortunately tho, all gravitas is instantly sucked out of this movie just as the characters are sucked in to CGI wonderland 20min in.I knew something was off from the jump when Cassie Lang starts her new introduction as a character talking about terrible cops (even tho her adopted father was a good one) and preaching to the screen about homelessness (which is a serious issue) However getting this so early and from a new actress in the roll & our first introduction to the 'Stinger' going forward; just felt like politicking shoved down my mouth right off the jump.The rest is downhill from there with boring side plots with goofy CGI characters. I felt myself disliking them all because they were all so shallow and computer in nature. Juxtapose this with say the Guardians Christmas Special - where I loved every alien actor in their crazy and unique costumes. I'm gonna miss you James Gunn.At this point rather than being met with awe your still left lost as the stakes are so low. There's this looming threat you know is Kang but Janet slowly and painfully reveals this through flashbacks. All of which left me wishing this was a Kang movie in the way that Infinity war is really a Thanos movie.Johnathan Majors is incredible as Kang. However at no point did I feel the weight of it. I keep sitting there waiting to see this monster of man with the cunning that kept Tony Stark alive all those year. Alas we are left disappointed as Kang forgets his psychic abilities and gets his ass kicked by Paul Rudd.. I mean Antman.Poor Wasp is so relegated to a plot device in the movie that I could barely stand watching her. She just shows up to solve the problem in the last moment with no meaningful purpose.And this point in the review I would think this would be enough to encourage Marvel to slow down and look at things more closely... but we haven't even mentioned MODOK. Yikes....Whoever worked on the CGI for Ironman 1 would be ashamed. Asides from his shoddy look. He is a complete joke with no real path as to why. I get that he has gone mad but this is the same man who killed all those little sheep... & goooed his coworker. Not to mention tried to kill a child. Now he's strictly a crazy joke that looks so terribly weird.I can keep going...but I'll just leave it at this:The movie shocked me. I was left sitting there like really? Did they really just release this. This is the next Thanos?!PS- I'm also terrified now how they will handle secret wars. Kang replacing Doom already was gut punch."
9," Quantumania is pure Sci-fi and it is magical!
",bobtahar,/user/ur37083300/,18 February 2023,Love it.... LOVE IT!!! I love Sci-fi... even the obscure low budget foreign Sci-fi movies. Quantumania is pure Sci-fi and it is magical!I don't like to read or watch movie reviews before I watch the actual movie but my only exception is when the movie got really bad reviews. I wanna know how bad it is so I can lower my expectations... and damn... Quantumania got really bad reviews.What I got from these reviews are... seems like they are trapped in the 2 previous Ant-Man movies mindset especially on the humor. They also talk a lot about plot holes. When Marvel introduced the Multiverse... that already a big ass plot holes in MCU. Every other MCU movies that dealt with Multiverse have multiple plot holes in it.Some also seems like unable to accept a secondary level Avenger facing an Avengers level big villain like Kang.Quantumania is a movie introducing Kang to MCU phase 5... and the movie successfully done it. Jonathan Majors as Kang is amazing... Kang is absolutely menacing and scary.Ant-Man defeating Kang is very important for Phase 5 Kang Dynasty movie... if a secondary level Avenger can kill a Kang who already killed other variants of Kang in other Multiverse... what more destruction a top tier level Avengers can do to other Kang variants... hence the 1st post credit scene.This movie called Ant-Man and The Wasp... many reviews also said Wasp not so much in the movie. What version of Quantumania are they watching?? Hope / Wasp is in the movie from the get go until the end. She has a big role in the movie.The movie itself is great... magical Quantum Realm... fast pace... non stop action packed... funny... emotional... a lot of ants and a lot of Ant-Man. All characters are great... the Pym family... Cassie... the freedom fighters and even MODOK is awesome... if you ever watched Patton Oswalt MODOK... he's about 80% likeHighly...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED... 8.5/10... Quantumania for me is the best Ant-Man movie in the franchise and the best MCU phase 4 movie since Spider-Man No Way Home.2nd post credit scenes.... can't wait for Loki season 2.

",passan-80670,/user/ur115903353/,18 February 2023,"Man, this product has no reason to exists.Most of it is just talking in 3 locations. Half or it is just talking in 3 locations.The CGI gets boring very quickly. This is effectively an aminated product.The Wasp saved this product, while the old lady is in there the most and dictates this product. Makes me wonder, why it is considered an ""Antman"" product.Deus-Ex-Ant-Machina. They just pull it out of thin air and it makes no sense.Kang is insanely boring. All he can is building B-Level storm troopers. And shoot laser that vaporizes people.The Stormtroopers did nothing. They lost against guys with swords.The ""Massage"" of capitalism bad and socialism good is insulting. The makers clearly never seen what happened to the ideologies when millions of people were killed and had to suffer for ""utopia""."

Not great, but not bad. It was Marvel without being overtly Marvel. Very thin, somewhat predictable plot without any surprises or twist.

7," An average MCU film
",dakotadickenson-83457,/user/ur161212279/,18 February 2023,"Just got done watching Ant-Man and the Wasp:Quantumania and wanted to give my thoughts on it. First off, this isn't a excellent Marvel film, but it's not a terrible one either. This is a average MCU film to kick off Phase 5 of the MCU and honestly will probably only be remembered for being the start of Phase 5. It was great to see Paul Rudd back as Ant-Man, but I feel some of the source material that was given to him wasn't always the best. Evangeline Lilly as the Wasp was great to see again, but I feel like her character was sidelined for a majority of the film including Michael Douglas as Hank Pym. Both characters have their moments throughout the film that I enjoyed though. The standout characters that carry this movie were definitely Michelle Pfeiffer Janet Van Dyne and Jonathan Majors Kang the Conqueror. I loved every scene these two characters were in together and loved the chemistry between them as well. It left me wanting more of both of them together. I was also glad to get more of a back story of Janet's time in the quantum realm. Jonathan Majors hands down is Kang the Conqueror and give this movie his best performance he could possibly give with the source material given to him. The only downside I had with his character, is like Paul Rudd's Ant-Man, not all of the source material given to him was always the best and was disappointing sometimes, but Kang the Conqueror was definitely my favorite character of the entire film. One character I thought that was better than I thought would be due to the other actress who played the character in Avengers: Endgame was recast in this movie was Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang. I came around and really enjoyed her take on the character. I can't wait to see more of her in the future. The last character that I loved in this movie that I was aware of going into this movie, was gonna be either a love or hate character was M. O. D. O. K. And I absolutely loved this character more than I anticipated too. He had some of the best lines in the film and even though his CGI wasn't always the best, Marvel was able to pull off his character introduction. When it comes to the tone of the movie, I feel like Marvel copied Star Wars way too much when it came to the source material and it didn't always sit right with me. There are also 2 post credit scenes. The first one honestly in my opinion wasn't a fan of, but the second one has me hyped for what's to come in the future. Overall, this film isn't perfect, but the performances given by Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer, make this film worth the watch. Rating 7.5/10."
1," Phase Five has a weak start
",basementbrotherscollectibles,/user/ur142280227/,18 February 2023,"Positives: Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, and Paul Rudd are good and familiar. They carry the film. Good chemistry between the family and traditional love.Critiques: Many people will praise Jonathan Majors, but I thought he either talked too slowly or overacted when he was trying to be threatening or angry. He's another generic MCU villain, not a Thanos-level threat. His acting isn't threatening...just the fact that he can and has many copies of himself throughout the multiverse.-M. O. D. O. K. Fans will not be getting what they want from this character. He's a clowned punching bag and looks really bad with the CGI.-Cassie is annoying, mouthy, spoiled, and whinny. She also got typical Hollywood political values and is a girl boss. She looks and acts like a typical Gen-Z Disney actress. All the characters think and say ""She's amazing"" of course.-There is an underlying theme of a socialist revolution where they mock cops, help the rebels, fight the empire, and ""burn it all down."" There is even a line about ants being highly developed socialists and that we humans could learn from them."
5," Forgets about the little guys
",EdwardtheBlackPrince,/user/ur129636274/,18 February 2023,"Ant-Man The Wasp Quantumania is the third installment in the series and the kick-off of Phase 5 of the MCU. Scott after saving the world seems to be getting back to his life with Thanos. Wrote a book, was treated like a hero by the public and still trying to make up lost time with his Daughter. The whole family are shown Cassie and Hank have been working on a project involving the Quantum realm and receive signal, but after a mishap, they all get sucked into the realm and have to now find a way home while also dealing with an interdimensional tyrant Kang the Conqueror. Quantumania in many ways is more the typical Marvel Formula with poor visual effects and unwarranted humor. Overall It's more of a film that's only purpose is to set up further events as opposed to having a fun self-contained story. In the long run, it serves no purpose outside of introducing moviegoers to Kang. The first 35 minutes of the film are almost pointless showing Scott, hope, and all of them and showing that Scott has a separation between himself and Cassie, but it doesn't set up much in terms of development. As soon as they hit the Quantum Realm that is thrown away in favor of just showing off the realm. Honestly, it is not all that interesting. As opposed to Doctor Strange's. This is CGI Splattered all over the Screen that is devoid of much in terms of life. You have no idea how this world works. You micro people living here some that look human others that look like blobs and all amounts strange designs. There's a rebel group, not a single thing you will know about them. Yet you suppose to care about them being free from Kang. The World's forgettable as for the main cast most of them are boring and outraged. A huge issue with Ant-Man and The Wasp was that Scott was reduced to an idiot while the focus was primarily going to hope. Here He kinda takes a backstage again, this time by Michelle Pfeiffer who is a talent and actress, even though it is poorly written why she doesn't tell anyone about Kang. Hope does very little in the majority of the film and Michael Douglas is just there. His big moment comes near the end and it's really stupid the explanation. As for the villains, The Highlight is Jonathan Majors as Kang When he's introduced, it's almost like you entered a different movie, and while it shows potential for this character. He also has its weak points, because given the stern serious tone he goes with it just stands out that this wasn't the right film for him to debut with all this marvel humor and just undermines him in the end. He also does suffer from the fact that they explain just the basic of who he is without going into depth. Modok is just stupid and yes he's look is a little stupid in the comics with the huge head and baby legs, but still has an opposing monster look to him. Here it's just silly and everything he does is just silly it's not even Modok they just recycle the previous villain's yellowjacket. Overall it forgettable movie with no real stakes."
6," at least it's better than Thor L & T
",jack_pearson,/user/ur30302432/,18 February 2023,"I am not quite sure what tone they were going for was but the end result is cesspool of tones. One minute it's a cool sci-fi adventure, then a drama, then sometimes a bad comedy. Jonathan majors (kang) is the saving grace, he is a real presence on screen and demands your attention, he seems to be the only actor who took the role serious but even his acting couldn't save the writing. We are told by everyone how bad kang is through a ton of exposition but we never see him do anything that warrants his reputation. Kang was overthrown and defeated with ease, he did not seem like the guy the writers wanted him to be. I could not see him going head to head with the avengers or even killing them (clearly can't even beat ant man). I hope future renditions of kang live up to the hype because the guy who is a supposed super intelligent villainous warlord was beaten by the joke of the avengers and the wasp, they literally just punched him into his energy core...also the cassie actress was pretty bad, her acting was by far the worst in the MCU. It's enjoyable but it's not good."
6," ""Why the Size-Shifting Hero Struggles to Be Taken Seriously""
",SiddharthSai,/user/ur52080572/,18 February 2023,"Antman Quantumania, the first movie of Phase 5 and possibly the last of the Antman trilogy, had a lot to live up to. Unfortunately, the film didn't quite deliver on its promises. Despite an action-packed trailer with Antman fighting against Kang, the movie itself felt ordinary and lacked the excitement of its predecessor. The forced comedy also fell short in places. While Marvel remains the king of comic adaptations, the forgettable soundtrack and lack of standout scenes left a lot to be desired. However, the second half of the movie did have some redeeming moments with Kang and impressive 3D visuals. As we look ahead to the next installment in the MCU, Guardians of the Galaxy, it seems that we'll be in for another light-hearted adventure. Yet, many fans miss the serious, action-packed films that drew them to the universe in the first place. Overall, Antman Quantumania had its moments, but it didn't quite meet expectations."
10," Good movie
",gagandeepsingh-61741,/user/ur147553198/,18 February 2023,I don't know why so much criticism is going on with this movie but this movie is not that bad. Not a master piece movie but starts phase 5 with lots of questions about Kang which creates hype for Avengers Kang dynasty. It is a fantastic movie in the ant man trilogy other than ant man (2015) and ant man and the wasp (2018). Please stop spreading hate about this movie and watch this on the biggest screen possible to enjoy the quantum realm. Marvel ruined a character like MODOK just like Gorr in Thor love and thunder but introduction to Kang in the MCU is worth watching. Stay away from spoilers as there is a surprise cameo in the post credit scene.
2," Kang Is A Joke and So Is This Movie. Marvel's Worst.
",scootm16,/user/ur36048691/,18 February 2023,"Where do I even start with this boring, exposition-drenched Star Wars wannabe?I guess I'll start at when I knew the movie was going to be trash. At the beginning of the movie, Ant-Man has to go down to the local police station to pick up his daughter from jail. She was arrested because the police were tasked with clearing out a homeless encampment (in reality, encampments are a serious crime issue on the West coast), but Ant-Man's daughter didn't like that, so she destroyed police equipment. The next scene at dinner, Hank Pym said he would've marched in there and broken her out of jail. Why is Marvel pushing anti-policing/anti-justice and having a teenage girl as their ""martyr"" or spokesperson or whatever. Shouldn't the Marvel heroes be working together with the police to stop crime? What is this leftist gibberish? I have grown to expect this from Marvel after the Disney acquisition, but man were the politics extra loud in this movie.Regardless of the extreme leftist political pandering written by someone who is completely detached from actual society and the real world being forced onto us, the movie was still trash. Kang was an absolute joke of a villain in this movie. I have no idea how they plan(ned) on making him the new big bad, someone on Thanos's level after what I just saw. The action was so boring and drab because you know everyone's going to be fine. There's no sense of danger or risk that something won't go as planned. So many scenes and sets were just blatantly ripped from A New Hope it's honestly pathetic.I know Disney owns Marvel and Star Wars, but keep them separate. Let them have their own feel to them, like back when the first Avengers came out. That movie had its own unique feel/aura and has aged extremely well. Marvel movies are now too busy pandering to politics to tell an interesting story with real fleshed out characters dealing with serious issues that have consequences. It feels like every Marvel movie is trying to be Thor Ragnarok now, and that only spells disaster.I'm more sad than mad. I thought this movie looked decent from the trailers too. After this, I don't think the days of actual quality films like Iron Man or Avengers are coming back, not from Disney.The most criminal thing about this movie is they somehow even made Paul Rudd unlikable.2/10."
4," A CGI theme park with little less more to offer.
",andresmendezsolis,/user/ur161836458/,18 February 2023,"This movie has so many tone changes that leaves you confused as for what it really tries to offer. Is it comedy? Is it drama? It is of course comic-book sci-fi, that much is clear from the get-go, but it changes so abruptly its tone that you don't even know if you should feel sad or laugh for the characters when something happens to them. Every transcending event is diluted with humor to the point you feel nothing of importance actually occurs and it ends with little more than a TV series single episode adventure that can be completely forgotten by the next day. You have the cheap, shallow humor you can expect from Marvel, but that seems to be the essence, the ""raison d'être"" of this universe to the point these movies only offer you a two hour CGI excess with a storytelling that could be reduced to 20 minutes.Can be completely skipped and, if you want to understand the Marvel phase, just read the overall idea and that's it."
10," Great Start For Phase 5
",jjsomers-18612,/user/ur142266042/,18 February 2023,"Although critics haven't appreciated this movie, I stand with the majority of fans who enjoyed this film. I have been a fan of the MCU for many years, and really liked parts of Phase 4 when many others did not. However, in my opinion, this film is on the same level as some of my favorites. I have very few criticisms, and I am looking forward to the future of Kang. Every performance was great, and there were many wonderfully comedic moments. The MCU's rendition of MODOK is delightfully unsettling in his appearance, and definitely brought comedy to several of the films more serious moments. 10/10."
7," Ant-Man 3
",bostonboy-57498,/user/ur85624103/,18 February 2023,"Let's be honest, Johnathan Majors was FANTASTIC as Kang, Other than that it was simply an OK movie, Paul Rudd, and Micheal Douglas did an OK job but the plot and story are very weak so they could only do so much. Visuals were amazing also, Its a beautiful looking film and I loved all the new creatures you met though the course of the film. It was manly the story just wasn't good. M. O. D. U. K. Was kind of a wasted charactor which kinda sucked, They could have done so mu h more with that. I will say this though, I am very excited for what's to come. Majors is gonna be fantastic and I can't wait to see what's next."
6," Mid-tier MCU entry.
",ayush-bista,/user/ur33364545/,18 February 2023,"Honestly Wasn't hoping for much but wasn't hoping for this. The acting of Kathryn Newton did not meet expectations, and her performance was lacking in emotional depth and believability. Additionally, Kang the Conqueror left a lot to be desired, as the character appeared powerless and unthreatening. He was the best however. Among the actors when he came in he felt serious and he set the tone but be he felt very powerless for the likes of ""The Conquerer"".Overall, while ""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" may have some entertaining moments, it falls short. However, it's worth noting that this is just one opinion, and other viewers may have a different experience and perspective on the movie."
7," Kang Is Amazing
",jolerozeerio,/user/ur91344866/,18 February 2023,"This is my favorite of the Ant Man trilogy. In this movie, the Ant Family is taken hostage and spread across the Quantum Realm, discovering a truly dangerous madman at the center of this alternate universe plotting his escape. As always, the performances were incredibly fun to watch and it was nice being able to spend time with the Langs and the Pym's as they trek across this vast and surreal landscape.Certain characters get more play than others, which is regrettable. Evangeline Lilly feels sidelined in this film which doesn't feel right given her characters importance in these movies thus far. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer are charming as ever, Paul Rudd feels dynamic and confident in his third solo hero outing, but the real gem of this story is Jonathan Majors and Kang the Conqueror.Unlike He Who Remains, Kang is without whimsy. He isn't playful or charming, he is ruthless and deeply driven to escape the Quantum Realm to continue his conquest across time and space. He is played with genuine menace and arrogance, truly displaying the danger he represents to the Avengers and the multiverse as a whole.Overall, this is a strong, albeit inconsistent start to the MCU's Phase Five with the promise of more adventure to come."
7," Reviewers and Critics are lost
",wickdws,/user/ur59781984/,18 February 2023,"I don't understand what people expect from movies anymore. It's as if that there is a checklist that they look through when they're watching a movie which completely destroys the point when you're watching a movie. You're supposed to just enjoy what someone else has created, and not try and knit pick and find every little thing wrong with it. There is nothing wrong with it because you didn't make it so your opinion has nothing to do with whether it was right or wrong. Yes there are some movies that are horrible because of how they were made or how the cinematography is or other things. I used to be able to check reviews and kind of get an idea whether I would like the movie but now these days I can't trust any of it because it's completely opposite of what I end up watching. This movie is a perfect example of where everything that I read was not what I watched. Did this movie suck? No. Was this movie amazing? No. But it was good in my opinion. And that's the point. It's MY opinion. These critics don't speak about their opinion, they speak as if their word is fact. This movie was dead on opening night when I was just there, and not because it sucked. It's because people listen to reviewers and choose not to go. And that's horrible cause this movie deserved more credit."
8," It was a charming movie!
",thatirken,/user/ur162442392/,18 February 2023,"I liked this movie, quite a bit. I've never seen a my of the other ant man installments but this was pretty easy to understand with a basic knowledge of prior marvel films. I will admit the CGI was questionable at times and some of the humour didn't land very well, but I left the theater feeling pretty damn good. The action sequences were cool and exciting, and Kang is a formidable villain, and I'm excited to see more of him. I wish the movie had focused a bit more on tying off the ant man trilogy, but I do like how they opened the doors to the future. I feel like this is a pretty solid way to kick of phase 5."
8," To Many Haters
",vjwxffkq,/user/ur153047592/,18 February 2023,"Probably the best Ant-Man in series, great setup for Kang Dynasty as well as loved M. O. D. A. K... family friendly great mix of humor and action. People want to much out of Marvel after End Game while forgetting most of these movies are here to set up the big payoff movies like future Avengers movies. This movie was better then most of phase 4 outside of Spider-Man, and Shang-Chi. Scott Langston whole arc I will do anything for my daughter, I see 0 issue with this as a hero movie. He just wants to be her hero not MCU. The one thing this movie was missing that last movies had was Ignacio because he is to funny. All Around 8 out if 10."

",gerrydax-78680,/user/ur81602008/,18 February 2023,"Saw this today.Visually superb and a wee bit trippy.All the main cast have bits to do but the original Ant Man scores.The publicity stuff is slightly misleading but I can excuse that
Formulaic ? A bit, but laying down the foundations for the next few films then the inevitable climax, has to start somewhere. Ant Man is an easy way in, humorous in places, serious in places, nicely balanced.Criticisms ? Nothing major
Kang will be the storyline for the next few years then the F4 and mutants will be centre stage
Bring it on, its another good one and nice start for Phase V - stay to the very end as always, it'll be worth it."
8," The title is very fitting!
",ghaley-56836,/user/ur67488184/,18 February 2023,"First of all... I think a looot of people reviewing this movie are wearing Phase 4-tinted lenses. I'm choosing to review this film as a standalone adventure and an Ant-Man sequel. In that regard, I think it does so exactly as advertised! Quantumania is a very fitting title for this rollercoaster, a very enjoyable ride in my experience.The campy intro and ending segments with Scott's narration is definitely silly and a little out of place, but I think it's mostly because this was not an established thing that happened within other Ant-Man films or scenes. If Scott was narrating to himself in the other movies, I think this would've landed much better and could've even been a character trait for him like Deadpool or She-Hulk's 4th wall breaking.The only other thing I didn't like about this film, before I get to the good stuff, is that the only returning actors aside from the main squad are the agent from Ant-Man 2 in a brief cameo and the Baskin Robbins boss from the original movie. I greatly missed appearances from Cassie's mother, stepfather and the whole crew from Scott's security company, especially Michael Peña! They could've cut back to the surface world to show scenes of them bumbling around, but I totally respect that it would've broken the immersive intentions.Now then, once the beacon goes off and the main 5 heroes get sent down into the Quantum realm, that's when it really gets going. I was personally never bored or starved for visual stimulation by this movie, I thought it was honestly beautiful to watch in full 3D. I understand that special effects aren't anything overly special anymore, but I felt the world and unique environments created were worthy of great praise. If you've still got some curious life left in your eyes, you should treat yourself to this film. I don't have the insanly high expectations for computer animation than most reviewers, so I didn't have a negative thing to say about it in that regard. MODOK was a...choice, to be sure. Even that I felt wasn't worthy of the hate its receiving, I really enjoyed watching the d-bag that was Darren Cross be dragged through the comedic villainous mud and his actor was fully committing to the silliness of it all! Basically impossible to do a serious MCU MODOK, so I was certainly satisfied with this. I felt like every thread was followed through on and the theme of parenthood and family really rang strong throughout the whole ride, even possibly hinting towards Kang's grief of family loss.Kang the Conqueror... This man stole the show for sure, its undeniable. I guess we'll have to wait for Loki season 2 to drop before we'll see his terrifying presence again. Throughout the Infinity Saga, I never felt Thanos' true presence and threat until Infinity War. However, from the second he appeared on screen in the opening scene of the movie, I knew this guy was something else... I'm genuinely kinda terrified that we don't really know when he'll pop back up. I highly doubt they're gonna wait all the way until Kang Dynasty to show us his real threat to the MCU world we know so well.All in all, this is a fully satisfying movie experience! Especially if you take off your ""Marvel sucks now"" glasses and put away your ""just more Phase 4"" expectations and go to see an Ant-Man movie about the Quantum realm.Also... I'm sorry that everybody hates humor now, but the entire MCU is woven with great comedic writing and has been from the start. If you show me a dark, dramatic superhero movie and a funny, adventurous superhero movie, I'm going to rewatch the one that made me laugh."
6," An Average Start to Phase 5 of the MCU
",michaelfox-10431,/user/ur62667429/,18 February 2023,"Let me make this clear, this isn't a bad film. Though I feel like this certainly didn't excite me enough about what's to come in phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Marvel has always been quite corny with its humour and I feel like this film doesn't do well in separating the serious moments with the humour side of it which makes it difficult to explain and establish for me how much of a threat the villain in this film and the rest of the MCU is.I felt like narratively, the film didn't flow well. At the end I would consider how they got out of their issue to be lazy story writing. The ending was starting to look brutal and refreshing that it was different to other marvel films, but rather than make the film any longer they cut off what I thought was going to be a really interesting end, to make it the same as any other superhero film.Onto the positives? Johnathan killed it with playing Kang. Paul Rudd like always gave us a good performance but they seemed to have thrown Michael Douglas to the side a little bit in the film. He wasn't involved too much.Interesting scenes and special effects which looked fantastic.Not a bad film but certainly with a film that flowed better and didn't use the slapstick humour over the narrative it would have been better than a 6/10. But it was too similar to Thor love and Thunder and we all know how that went down..."
8," Mind Blowing
",stevendbeard,/user/ur2929860/,18 February 2023,"I saw Ant_Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, starring Paul Rudd-Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Our Idiot Brother; Evangeline Lilly-the Hobbit movies, The Hurt Locker; Michelle Pfeiffer-Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, Dark Shadows_2012; Michael Douglas-Last Vegas, Haywire and Jonathan Majors-The Harder They Fall, White Boy Rick.This is the third in the Ant_Man trilogy-not counting other Avenger related appearances-following the first in 2015 and the second in 2018. Paul returns as the new Ant-Man, Evangeline as the new Wasp, Michael as the former Ant-Man and Michelle as the former Wasp. Jonathan comes aboard as Kang the Conqueror, a time traveling villain that has been exiled into the sub atomic universe known as the Quantum Realm. The whole ant/wasp family gets sucked down into this universe and crosses paths with Jonathan, who also is familiar with Michelle from her time being stranded there for 30 years. It seems that she is the reason Jonathan can not leave the Quantum realm so in her absence, he conquered the native populace and now wants to leave for bigger conquests. There are mind blowing fights-Duh-and lots of fantastic looking alien creatures/scenery with a few surprise cameos thrown in. One is a comedian as an alien friend of Michelle and another is a villain named M. O. D. O. K. If you don't know, you can ask a comic nerd like me what M. O. D. O. K. Stands for. As the end credits start is a scene and another at the very end. And then after that, it states that someone-and it's not Ant_Man-will return.It's rated PG-13 for action, violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 5 minutes.I really enjoyed it-bet you didn't see that coming-and would buy it on Blu_Ray."
5," New Old Marvel Movie
",Lubb_,/user/ur155567178/,18 February 2023,"Usually, when one leaves the theater after watching a movie, there's a sense of emotion, whether it's fear from a horror film or the satisfaction of a good movie. Leaving the theaters after this movie has left me feeling unsatisfied and just overall meh. The climax was lackluster, the plot development was subpar, and the character growth was just so-so. Additionally, it's an Antman movie; I came to watch Antman, and all the different characters felt contrived and forced. It's repetitive, the same old Marvel recipe for the same old movie with the same old humor but with different characters and plots. Overall just a very mediocre movie; not as bad as previous films but not the stepping forward point it should've been."
8," Wacky fun
",willz187,/user/ur54800458/,18 February 2023,"I thought this flick was pretty cool. Id maybe go see it again. I like that it didnt get into Star Trek territory. Maybe I just liked it because there hasnt been any good movies out lately. I loved seeing what the villain was all about. Id rather immerse myself in this CGI world than Avatar. It has some different characters, giving us something other than superheroes and tech. If youre looking for something to trip out on, something like Aquaman, its freaking awesome. The realm feels like when Dr Strange fought Dormammu, which was an wicked scene. When i compare it to the other stuff out there like on TV Carnival Row, Picard, Moon Girl...Quantumania blows them out of the microshpere."

",lkalo-84758,/user/ur162440436/,18 February 2023,"This movie brought so much joy into my life. Now I am one of the marvel fans who love almost anything they put out (Thor Love and Thunder was ok along with the She-Hulk Finale). However with the story of both Scott and Janet wanting more time with their kids was amazing. It really helps connect this movie with the pervious title, Ant-Man and the Wasp. I will say though the plot was a little rushed. It felt like they were in the Quantum realm too soon in the movie. I was missing Luis and I felt it would have been fairly easy to include him the first part of the movie. Anyway, the relationship between Scott and Cassy really helped make this movie a 10/10 for me."

Kang looked good and there were really few characters and very less screen time for ants really enjoyed it and in depth experience how the future will be was very good but some steps were too random e.g. Opening a portal for Scott in the end they could have came out by going sub atomic .Quantum realm was shown very nicely with great graphics stuff and that un necessary holding the truth about kang was useless hope future movies of ant man will br more funny with Kurt, Louis and dave (tip)."
7," You Can Call It a Trilogy
",PCC0921,/user/ur109135693/,18 February 2023,"So, I'm not going to say this is a great Marvel film. However, I also won't say it is a bad movie either. There are a lot of good things in this film, but it also has things going on within it, that could have been done better. It definitely is one of those filler-movies, Marvel has to release, every now-and-then, in order to tie things together, for the bigger MCU franchise's main plot-arc. The MCU has a problem due to this, but that problem is born from many good positives, found in the MCU's past. This problem doesn't apply to the fans, but does effect the more general audience. Marvel still needs to get to that point, when they can dazzle the audience again, with a huge block-buster, cross-over event, like Avengers: End Game (2019). In the meantime, they want to take their time and create a build-up to that next huge event. The fans are okay with that, but the general audience might not be.In the case of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), it makes sense, that the third film in the trilogy, should center around the quantum realm. It is part of the Ant-Man mythos found in the comic books, plus it plays a huge role in the main MCU story. We leave the setting of San Francisco, where the first two films took place and go to a completely different setting for this film. It's a quick arrival to the quantum realm too. Director, Peyton Reed gets right into it, as the plot takes us into the quantum realm, within the first 15 minutes of the film. This is where some of the problems develop in the beginning of the film. Director Reed has so much territory he needs to cover in this film, that those plot-points, took away time needed, to revisit the main characters. The Wasp was totally overlooked in this film. Other supporting characters suffer too. The beginning of the film is so quick, it looks sloppily forced at us, in order to get into the quantum realm.The positive side to this approach is, it creates a whole new different Ant-Man film. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023), contains a side to his character, that we don't get to see a lot. Rudd was tapped to bring in a comedic-side to the role, much like Michael Keaton was for Batman (1989). Both of these actors were able to sell their characters, as serious, emotional, superhero fodder, but also added that comedy splash into the design of the characters. These are great performances by both actors. It was very evident with Rudd in the first two Ant-Man films. This time however, Peyton Reed decides to tap more into the tough, brave, hero-side of Ant-Man, seen in Avengers: End Game (2019), by showing us a more mature, emotional, serious, successful, liberated Scott Lang. All of his head-aches from the past were gone, however the five year gap he lost with his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), weighs in on his mind.With the comedy-side of Scott Lang subdued, some of the comedy is dished-out to Michael Douglas' Hank Pym in this film. Both of the parents of Hope Van Dyne, the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), play a big role in this film. It was their depictions of Hank and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), that are stand-outs. Janet is tough and Hank is still cool. They are the original Ant-Man and the Wasp in this film. There are some new characters, that I thought were pretty good, like Veb (voice of David Dastmalchian), a slime creature, obsessed with holes, Quaz (William Jackson Harper), who can read minds and this cool, robot-creature, who's whole head is an energy-blaster. Can't find his name. He had no speaking parts. However, some of the new characters seemed slightly dull. What does pay-off well is the performance of Jonathan Majors as Kang, the Conqueror. His part in the film, is explained well, so the general audience should be satisfied and the fans should see some of the answers they have been looking for, since the end of season one of Loki (2021). This is a film, that is just going-through-the-motions, for the bigger picture and can be dull to some at certain moments. However, it does effectively end Payton Reed's trilogy. I'm sure, eventually, as time goes by, this film will slip down to the lower levels of MCU rankings, but for now, it sets up many interesting scenarios and new questions of things to come.6.6 (C- MyGrade) = 7 IMDB."
3," Worst marvel movie to date
",asalock,/user/ur106972662/,18 February 2023,"I didn't expect much from the movie as I've found that Antman isn't the best avenger but I was still disappointed.Visually, I found the movie stunning albeit somewhat clunky in parts. Definitely all filmed in one location with a lot of blue screen. That's ok, I dont mind.If you're looking for a movie that has the laziest writing ever, well, this movie is for you!Where do I start?Janet never talks about the quantum realm, she spent 30 years down there, 30 years real time and just so happens to be 30 years for her too!Her family ask about it, she refuses to speak about it and then gets mad when her husband continued to do what he did for the past 30 years - thats right, continue to look into the quantum realm (with his granddaughter this time). Ya know if she just said, id stay away if I were you, its not a good idea and then Hank Pim carrier on, id blame him. Well lazy writing part 2, granddaughter shows off her work for the first time to her family and no more than 20 seconds later, they're all pulled into the quantum realm. After Janet protests to stop.Janet then continues to not say what the issue is and uses the excuse to protect them. Imagine that, withholding information about Kang is going to protect them. We all know its to build suspense for the upcoming villain, write better excuses! We all know not saying anything is putting them at more risk, ergo makes zero sense.It gets better.We know Scott Lang spent 5 years in the realm.To cover the fact that he had never seen this world, we simply got ""You didn't see what I could see""
Gotcha, couldn't be arsed to make up something a bit better.To excuse the timings, that the ants spent 1,000 years etc. ""Ahh, we'll just chuck in the ole 'we all experience time differently' line so we don't have to explain anything!"" But well, time wasn't experienced differently except for the ants.They wrote Janet so badly, I really hoped she'd get killed off. She was irritating and annoying. Continuing to not explain where they were or what was happening. All I could imagine was the cut scenes as they travel being completely silent because she would say we'll talk about it later at the start of a journey and then continue the conversation at another location. Lord Krylar had great potential, but was just used to hype up Kang and then added nothing to the plot, just helped me hate Janet even more for being so unnecessarily cryptic.Positive note, Kang was very well done. He is a stellar actor - even if Marvel made him weak. He's an avengers level villain, Thanos level and yet he couldn't beat Antman in a broken suit, who's human, in a fist fight.I also enjoyed the introduction, it was a fun and easy-going way to get the audience up to speed."
8," Solid Trip into the Quantum Realm
",Smellman426,/user/ur82055986/,18 February 2023,"This movie was good. I enjoyed it as much as I expected though it did not exceed those expectations. I have enjoyed the past two Ant-Man movies, but they have never been my favorites (at least compared to some others), but this was probably the best of the three. The story was kind of all over the place, but at the same time, it was simple enough to follow. The best part of the movie was definitely Kang. Jonathan Majors delivered a great performance and every scene that he was in was great. Looking forward to seeing more of the character in the future. Kind of disappointed with M. O. D. O. K., thought he was added just so there could be another character in the movie and Kang could have a comic relief but the two of them barely interacted and I feel like he could have been saved for the future instead of just getting killed off so soon, but I digress. Interesting to see Cassie get some new development and have her own suit, guess we will see more adventures with Ant-Man, The Wasp, and Stature in the future. Not much else to say. This was not my favorite Marvel movie, but not the worst I have seen either."
10," Delivers in every aspect
",PorkerPerry,/user/ur154628782/,18 February 2023,"Truly one of the marvel movies of all time. Being the biggest film connoisseur on the planet, my taste is so refined I simply do not think very highly of most modern films. However this movie delivers in every aspect... I've never felt as emotional about a movie since maybe Daredevil (2003) and Oz (2013). I think what truly made this film so breathtakingly amazing and wholeheartedly inspiring is the mix of draw-jopping action with a sort of an oaky afterbirth of a beautifully written plot. M. O. D. O. K. Is without a doubt the greatest superhero character I've ever had the pleasure to view in cinemas, he is simply too hot to not arrive for. I almost suffered from auto-erotic asphyxiation multiple times through my already 27 viewings of the film in theaters. It's simply a masterpiece. 10 out of 10 Paul Rudd extrANTaganza. Highly recommend!"
6," I cant defend the mcu anymore
",lucasnicolasvasilescu,/user/ur147359174/,18 February 2023,"I have loves the mcu since i was a little kid, even when the movies/tv shows were considered bad i was there to defend them, i liked iron man 2. This movie is the peak of quantity>quality, the cgi is very bad, which isnt unusual for the mcu recently. The movie does not contain any character development whatsoever, the characters do not change or learn anything througout the movie, it feels like the movie was made for 5 year olds. The cinematography is bad but its marvel so it wouldnt be expected to be good (i dont really care about cinematography here tbh). The humor isnt as present as you would expect but even when its there it doesnt work that well, modok is a very bad comic relief, marvel studios have ruined his character. On the other hand, Kang as a villain works but the way he loves is just completely wrong, they did him so dirty, he's Kang the conquerer, he is supposed to be basically unbeatable, i still liked him as a character but it could have been done so much better. Even with all of this i still anjoyed the movie for what it was surprisingly enough. The post credit scenes were really great though, seeing Rama-Tut and Immortus felt good and that scene pulled straight out of the comicbooks was epic! The second post credit scene had me grappin my chair, Loki is back for a season 2 and we have (imo) a scene from it, it was amazing, Loki was definetly the best marvel studios tv-show.Overall the movie trier some things but didnt explore them all the way and it felt like it was rushes and made cheaply, you will be able to like it if you dont expect anything from it. Cant wait to see more of Kang.(Sorry if i misspelled some words, english is not my primary language)"
4," Tired, inconsistent and inconsequential
",cameronstacey-30501,/user/ur162438561/,18 February 2023,"Desperately headed by an airbrushed cast of tired and uninterested actors, frantically attempting to provide some form of acting as they run around afront an unconvincing green screen more akin to sharkboy lava girl than a marvel film.Kang on paper poses a mighty force, that amounts to some poor and inconsistent displays of ability, just to be defeated by a C-Tier hero despite having destroyed entire universes.The film very quickly shows it doesn't take itself seriously with jokes that do not land despite its very dark themes.Fails to deliver on it's potential.End credits save the film."
4," I'm conflicted by what I just saw..
",mgentalen,/user/ur20898450/,18 February 2023,"Let me state right away, I am not a regular Marvel Universe Viewer, so my opinion is subjective. I have seen Doctor Strange 2 and one of the Spider Man's theatrically, so, bear with me on this one.You may be asking, why did I go to see Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania , when I have only seen two other Marvel films? I wanted to see a film, and help my Disney shares.Having not seen the events of the last two films, I can't state why Scott is Ant Man. We open in normal San Francisco, Paul Rudd wrote a book about the events of the last film. He picks up his daughter from prison, (who is also an ant daughter?) his family, along with Michael Douglas get swept into this other dimension. This point was when I kept asking myself , what the heck is going on?The whole film felt far too cartoony, like this made for children. I don't hate Marvel, but, I always feel like I'm watching a movie for kids. Bill Murray makes a fun cameo, but he's in for only 5 minutes. They have a character, a central charcter, named MODOK (?) , which is a giant head. He gets annoying quick.The only thing I found really likable was Michael Douglas, I found myself thinking of other things to often while viewing this, which is not a good sign.This movie relies on CGI too much and in my opinion, had a poor story.C."
7," Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road
",SHU_Movies,/user/ur86310970/,18 February 2023,"I saw the very mixed reviews and got super nervous about this, but I'm gonna be honest here... I enjoyed it. I think a lot of people went into it expecting a complete tonal change, when of course there wasn't going to be. It's an Ant-Man movie! Although it has some quite intense aspects, it's still a quite fun and light-hearted superhero story. And I must say, it was pretty funny. I've not heard my whole cinema room laugh so much at a MARVEL movie in... Years! I mean, No Way Home was the single greatest cinema experience of my life, with people actually cheering and applauding, but the jokes in Quantumania had the crowd laughing throughout.Now, although it was really fun and I had a pretty great time, it wasn't that amazing on a technical level. I think a lot of people that have watched and reviewed it haven't given it enough credit, though, because it has a great story, decent writing and amazing performances. The biggest problem it has from a technical point of view is the visual effects. They were just super inconsistent, with some shots looking phenomenal, and others looking really bad, with super noticeable green screen.The ending and post-credits scenes definitely take away from my rating. The last act was pretty awesome and epic, but it went downhill very quickly.I'm quite disappointed with the setup they went with for Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. I get what they're going for, but it's just not as good a setup as we hoped they'd have in this, and it's gotten me very uncertain and actually kinda unconfident and somewhat uninterested in the future of the MCU. I don't think I can really say anything more without risking giving any spoilers.Overall, its a decent film that would've been a 7.5/10 if it weren't for the underwhelming and honestly crappy ending and post-credits scenes. I think if you liked the first two movies, then you'll probably enjoy this. It is very dependent on what you like in your comicbook movies, so if you were a fan of the other movies in the Ant-Man trilogy, you'll likely have a good time with this.Oh, one last thing: How did Bill Murray get a character poster and MODOK didn't? Doesn't make sense!"
9," At last!
",mrglenngrant,/user/ur142268815/,18 February 2023,"I see that there's a lot of middling reviews for this latest Ant-Man movie out there. However ... I went to see it with P and Matt at the view staff preview and lordy! Is it about time that marvel got back in the game and gave us a bloody good movie again!I was highly trepadacious going in that this might be a horrible CGI-fest a la DC at their best/worst ... but I was pleasantly surprised that - although it was definitely a CGI-fest for the most part - it never took me out of the movie. So must have been ok.I was annoyed for a while that Hope just kept absolutely refusing to tell absolutely anyone about what she's experienced in the quantum realm. It took her far far too long to eventually spill the beans and I've no idea what the delay was all about. If it was for dramatic tension then it failed. It just cheesed us off.I loved the Darren / MODOK reveal. Bill Murray was also a joy and - despite being annoying and over-woke at times - the new cassie was really good as well. The side characters were also very entertaining ... ""I have holes!!"".Also thought the story was overall pretty great - although I do wish there had been some explanation or hint at how this entire weird civilisation came about in the quantum realm - and I loved the action throughout. The 'Endgame' (sorry) was believable and well executed.The post-credits were a bit confusing. Not sure what all the different Kangs really mean. Loved the Loki 2 setup though.After the very mixed bag that we've had so far from Marvel in Phase 4 this film's an absolute delight and I can't wait for this to get progressed further now.89/100."
7," A decent but underwhelming experience
",ethanbresnett,/user/ur114450253/,18 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is fine. It's nowhere near Marvel's best but it just about holds its own.Mostly this is because of Jonathan Majors, who is up there with Michael B Jordan's Killmonger as one of Marvel's finest antagonists. His performance is chillingly clinical and powerful. I don't think pitting him against Ant-Man is the best pairing however. The humour that goes hand in hand with Scott Lang contrasts the seriousness of Kang a little too starkly for my liking. I would have liked to have seen him up against a more serious Avenger.The rest of the performances are all good. Paul Rudd brings his charm to Scott Lang as ever. Kathryn Newton is a nice addition to the Marvel family, although I do think the chemistry between the two is a little weak.Where this film really gets let down is the story. Dare I say it I got a little bored. It just feels quite simple and underwhelming. The writing isn't great which doesn't help. The humour didn't really land for me either.It does boast some enjoyable visuals, with plenty of colour and vibrancy.I can't help but feel at this point that Marvel just needs to slow down. There is just so much Marvel content being pumped out that the action sequences, story lines, even the jokes, are just becoming far too formulaic and phoned in. When these films were coming out once, maybe twice a year that was more forgivable, but with 3 or more films and several TV shows each year the Marvel formula is getting a little tiresome. As a result I can't help but feel that Ant-Man is a victim of Marvel's success, resulting in a lacklustre and ultimately forgettable yet enjoyable film."
8," Very Entertaining and fun. Loved seeing the support and warmth of the Ant-Man family!
",ErReads,/user/ur109099446/,17 February 2023,"Despite some storyline choppiness, I thought this was a thoroughly fun and entertaining film. All of the central characters are very engaging to watch. Paul Rudd had great father-daughter chemistry with Kathryn Newton. Jonathan Majors is great as the villain. And I even liked most of the new side characters, including a red blob-like creature, a telepath and a warrior woman.MCU has had some misses post-endgame for me, but this wasn't one of them. Quantumania isn't a 10/10 for me, but it still delivered an enjoyable couple of hours and I look forward to seeing where things go from here. The mid-credits and post-credits scenes really sealed the story as well.I disagree with critics on this one! This definitely is way higher than a 43% it has on rotten tomatoes.Edit: One reviewer said this movie had no heart. I don't know what they are talking about. This was an MCU movie in which a family (The Ant-Man Family) loved each other, supported each other, displayed forgiveness and affection towards each other. That was one of the things I liked most about it."
6," Thank goodness for Jonathon Majors...
",jaclarke-46257,/user/ur134627066/,17 February 2023,"I'll keep it short and sweet, only for Jonathons excellent portrayal of The Conqueror, this rating would have been lower.Some good moments, mostly average. Mostly predictable.Kinda felt like watching Star Wars/Avatar at the same time but without the depth.Most of the usual cheesy lines we've heard a million times before...I really like the cast especially Paul Rudd - but, as seems to be the theme for a fair few recent MCU projects, it's just not very good.It felt 'mid' from start to finish - EXCEPT when Jonathon had the floor. He was excellent and I look forward to seeing his character develop, hopefully in better productions.The message to MCU that I seem to be repeating too much at the moment - you could, and SHOULD, be doing much better with your cast and resources."
10," Finally Marvel is getting on their feet again
",weldingr,/user/ur134442984/,17 February 2023,"OK. Compared with all movies marvel has done recently, specially the very very disappointing Thor Love and Thunder, this one was an easy 10. The best one since the the incomparable Spiderman No Way Home. We finally see the Quantum world and new entertaining characters. It has a lot of action but not too much to overwhelming you. And the acting was very cool. They cast Casey perfectly since she look and act a lot like her screen father. She was actually a very good surprise, since she acted the part of a teenager but without much complications. All of them acted like a team and the end was good enough to introduce you the real power behind the next Marvel big Villain. And what about those ğŸ�œ? That was genius and good to see them in full capacity.Overall I believe this movie don't deserve the 6 stars rating it is receiving."
4," Typicaly Ant-Man fun but overall low quality movie
",nevarezirving,/user/ur119824346/,17 February 2023,"This movie relied heavily on Rudd and Jonathan Majors as Kang.One of the main characters in this movie, Cassie, is an overall terribly written character. She comes off as incredibly mean to her father. Teens are typically written as mean to their parents, but it seems like the movie is trying to justify Cassie's attitude toward her dad.The movie starts off slow but gets good in the second act. When it comes to the third act, everything starts to fall apart. Certain victories for the heroes felt undeserved and not planned properly.This movie is a bit funny here and there but I do not find it to be very entertaining. I don't see myself choosing to re-watch this."
8," Fun - but don't think too hard
",murkee,/user/ur33070160/,17 February 2023,"I enjoyed the heck out of this - nice to see Kang properly in the MCU, but I did have some issues with the internal consistency of Ant Man going bigger and smaller than quantum's scale... he's a slow lumbering thing when he's large but *still subatomic*. That kind of works if the quantum world is faster than our world, but not otherwise.I did miss Luis, but he wouldn't have fitted in to this one. The mirroring of Scott's narration was a really nice touch beginning and end.The thing Marvel will have to take care with in Kang is that keeping his narrative coherent for the lay-audience will be very tricky indeed. ""Didn't they kill him, why are there two of them?"" I can imagine future films having characters asking dumb questions just so they can be explained to....Nice to see Kamala in the titles :)"
10," Don't believe the nonsense haters
",laurenshannon-47062,/user/ur101023549/,17 February 2023,"I loved this action packed romp through the quantum realm. Great performances esp Kang and of course Scott was as charming and goofy as ever. Special effects were great action scenes were exciting. I looked at these films and guardians of the Galaxy for fun and it delivered. Not every marvel outing Has to be epic.Spoilers:
Needed more ants! But I loved that they made it to the quantum realm!!! And the fighters in the refugee armies were fun and innovative as well. Nice seeing the whole family on an adventure together that was unexpected and pretty cool I wish they'd given a bit more to Michael Douglas but he had some great scenes!"
5," Enough now Marvel
",Bonobo13579,/user/ur110893307/,17 February 2023,"A serious case of diminishing (if you'll excuse the pun) returns happening now with the Marvel (P)universe. (Sorry)After a hohum start, the film is sucked into the Quantum realm and that's where the viewer begins a CGI yawnfest.Part of the charm of AntMan is the ordinary guy finding he has superpowers and making his fascinating way through a tiny Earth. As soon as you take this into an area like the quantum realm, any of that wonder is gone. The film's plot for what it is, is reminiscent of a million others. The realm has more than a whiff of Star Wars about it, with duplicate baddies like stormtroopers. The big bad is a bit Darth Vader and the various quantum creatures look like extras from the Lucas cutting floor.Even Paul Rudd's charm is tested and the ageless man is finally starting to look mortal.I won't be bothering with any more of these. Sadly from the adverts before this, looks like Hollywood is just one reboot after another.Please can we get back to some decent writing and originality. God knows there are plenty of brilliant Science Fiction writers out there just begging to be adapted, if that's the target audience.Dull."

",mdhatmustafa-92765,/user/ur120960043/,17 February 2023,"So, I heard everyone saying this movie was really bad and underwhelming...some of them even called it one of the worst MCU movies ever ?...and despite phase 4 being a train wreck so far lol, I thought that was a little harsh and I better see it myself to judge ( I really liked the trailers lol )... And now after watching it ... I can assure you it's NOT a bad movie! ...it actually started as a great "" adventure"" movie ... Getting down there and exploring the quantum realm by Scott and the family...it was actually pretty cool.. I swear, I'd rather watch a couple of movies about that instead of the crappy multiverse saga we got lol...It was decent... The side characters were nice... We got close to the family... A lot of the jokes and sarcasm were actually funny and tolerable... And then after being teased the whole time .. Kang ( the conqueror..the names are important here lol ) shows up.. And yup, Jonathan Majors did well... Although I think people are over praising him...sometimes he's a bit over the top and indulging... Yeah it's not thanos's level of charisma and threat.. No, people are just desperate lol...so far the movie is going well.. And THEN.. Oh boy... Just like every other phase 4 project... Now we have to end the movie... That's when logic gets completely shut down.. And all the BS takes over... Kang who was always two steps ahead of his opponent.. Is now literally waiting for everyone to counter his every move and relying on his minions ...the main characters get too op, practically invincible, the classic M-she-U... Male characters get saved by female characters.. Female characters always have the solution for everything....forced humor in what supposed to be epic / sad scenes...until we reach the very end.. and again.. Just like other phase 4 projects... The answer to everything is... THE MULTIVERSE... hey, we killed the bad guy / girl, does that mean we won?.. No, THE MULTIVERSE.. Okay, so when a character dies, are they really dead?.. No, THE MULTIVERSE... Okay, does anything still make any sense at all?... No, THE MULTIVERSE....that's pretty much sums up the botched multiverse saga... The infinity war saga was coherent, well established and well executed... It payed off really well... Infinity war and endgame were peak superhero movie experience ... Dude these days feel so long gone by now ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­...phase 4 has been terrible and absolutely has no soul... And based on what the cringey post credit scenes present... Yikes.. I don't think I'll be keeping up with phase 5...yup, I think it's a breakup lol...."
2," Generic superhero story probably written by ChatGTP
",ernestobladins,/user/ur47239420/,17 February 2023,"The movie is as generic as it gets. Being there, done that.No plot twists, no real stakes despite this villian threthening the multiverse. The big bad guy is not as menacing as Thanos.The movie would have been better if Scott Lang had just got murdered by Kang and him winning in this movie.That could have set up an arc of revenge for Scott's daughter, that would make sense considering she never has had much time with her dad and now that she could finally get some of that time, she realizes she will never have that due to this monster which would make her grow and take on the mantle of the antman to ""avenge"" the death of her dad.But instead she is already an avenger, she already has the suit, and can already beat bad guys.It would also have established Kang as a bigger threat than Thanos where could have just fone from movie to movie murdering some of the avengers permanently, starting with Scott.She also is one of the smartest kids in the planet somehow like every other teen girl in the mcu. I get that MCU wants girls to have role models, but this is ridiculous at this point.Every teen girl is a mega genius that builds quantum tunnels in her basement, special herbs that give you unnatural superpowers, robot that fly like iron man and that even the military has not been able to replicate despite having trillions of dollars to come up with their own version.The actress playing her is also bat at acting, she spends the entire movie with a face of contained laughter, regardless of what actual emotion that the scene would require.When she is suppsoed to be dissapointed at her dad, her face feels like she is laughing, when she is suppsoed to be sad, she is still with the face of contained laughter.It's like the Brie Larson, but the oppsoite. Brie Larson is always with a deadpan face regardless of the scene, never shows any emotion at all. While Scott's daughter is always laughing regardless of the situation.The humor again ruins this movies. It's like they saw that Guardians of the galaxy and deadpool were successfull and thought, hey we need to make every movie have goofy humour showhorned in and make everything a joke.Do they not realize that the best MCU movies are actually the ones that have less humor, like Winter Solider, Civil War, Infinity War, No way home,... sure those movies have a joke here and there, but compared to thor 4, or ant man 3, those movies are super serious and dramatic and allow you to feel and take whats happening seriously.In antman they are fighting, and suddenly they stop so Scott can teach his daughter how to punch, right there in the middle of the battle. That kind of thing takes away any tension the scene might have had, because if they can do that then clearly they are in control and not in any real danger, so if they are not in danger why should people care about what happens?The movie feels sometimes liek Starwars, but honestly you never really care about what happens. Kang is just eveil because he is a conqueror, and conquerors are bad because they conquer and build new worlds so that they keep continuing to conquer worlds. His motivation makes no sense, unlike Thanos's motivation. THis guy just likes to destroy worlds because the plot demands a big bad guy destroying worlds.It's not as bad probably as the critics would say, but its not as good as what the audience seems to be giving it in this page. I'd say 5 or 6 /10 being generous, but definetely a big dissapointment. The mcu needs less humor, and higher stakes. And hugher stakes doesnt mean that the world has to end, it means permanent consequences to the loved ones of the hero for example or to the hero himself.By that i mean that either AntMan should have died, or his daughter and his girlfriend should have died, or all of them. That would make us invested because we would not know what to expect for the other avengers that cross paths with Kang.I think its fair to say that its about time we point fingers at Kevin Feige, because it seems like he has lost his touch or maybe they fired people who made Kevin looked good."
7," Stop expecting endgame level movies. Go see it, it's fun.
",singledigitart,/user/ur162433644/,17 February 2023,"I wasn't sure what to expect with early mixed reviews.Over all, I had a lot of fun with it. It's not a by any means a perfect movie, but definitely worth a watch. Don't expect an endgame level movie. But it's a good ant-man movie with bigger stacked, setting up bigger things for the next couple MCU phases. It's got the right amount of jokes the land well and that feel like the original ant-man movie. The cast are all really good, but jonathan majors is a welcome addition to the movie Franchise. Bill Murray, Evangeline Lilly and some of the new characters are a little under used, and could of done with a little more to do. The end show down could of been beefed up a little more.Despite that, It's definitely a good enough movie and I'll be going back to see it. It's a nice fun taster for things to come. Stick around for the two post credits scenes, they are worth it."

",sbweightman,/user/ur93138442/,17 February 2023,"An alright superhero movie let down by a formulaic plot with nothing outstanding about it. Visually it's very good with lots of inventively different characters and a weird setting full of psychedelic landscapes, but the characters themselves conform to stereotypes and the main characters have little development. The story is relatively shallow and formulaic, consisting of a different world, a revolution to inspire and an unstoppable villain only the heroes can defeat. There's a good amount of humour and the action scenes are entertaining, even if you have seen it all before, but ultimately, nothing really stands out about it, either great or bad."
2," Cringeworthy - easily the worst marvel yet
",abbywynne,/user/ur35816319/,17 February 2023,"Well what can I say. Nothing new in the storyline, same familiar themes. 3D didn't work well - could be the cinema's fault, could be Marvel. Who knows? The actors didn't interact with the environment, they hardly interacted with each other - and the new style comedy moments were, well, not funny. I don't think it was the actors faults I think they just don't know how to handle the multiverse. And the multiverse with the quantum field - that's just too much for our brains.Bill Murray was in it for a hot second. Michelle Pfifer's hair was fabulous - I think that was my favourite part of the film - her hair."

",Arhhaan,/user/ur112333793/,17 February 2023,"Spoiler Free Review Ahh, what could be a better start for phase 5? I love how Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and showed us what Kang the Conquerer could be in future. I love the magnitude of science mashed throughout, loads of humour more than most Marvel movies, great action, and a wonderful story! This film is a strong start to Phase 5 and you can see the future trajectory of the MCU and where it goes. Paul Rudd has never been better in the role, but Jonathan Majors effortlessly conquers every second of screen time he gets. He is charismatic, intense and brutal and his presence is felt by everybody else. I love how the story is built between Scott and Cassie and it is the heart of the movie. The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is really creative!"

",damon-salvatore,/user/ur136661045/,17 February 2023,"Movie was good and thats the reason I gave it 8 stars coz its deserves for its action sequences and also movie sums up to be what its was built in sense of quantum realm and janets back story and her fear of quantum realm. But yeah somewhere in these antman got much less time than he should have got as its his movie. ""My Personal Opinion."" The one thing is that Kang wasn't shown at his full strength, or may be this variant of Kang...because they were making him the most power full villan after Thanos, it didn't seemed liked that but keeping AntMan against his did the work and the 2nd Credit scene just made it clear why was Kang shown weak, I'll not tell way coz that would spoil your fun and I'm not Tom Holland."

",liamrengers,/user/ur162433146/,17 February 2023,"Don't listen to critics or any of the lower numbers I promise you this will be movie of the year acting was great and the introduction for kang with Johnathan Majors was incredible visual effects was just crazy. Plot was very well written. It still is able to keep a little bit of that comedy that ant man movies usually have. This movie is definitely a must see. I can't wait to see what's next and what marvel has coming for us. This movie blew my mind and is setting up a lot for what's to come. If you love marvel, you will definitely love this. Great movie all around. Every actor and actress did great."
10," Good start for phase 5
",aimeebuzz,/user/ur162432958/,17 February 2023,"Strong start. Some people still expect every new marvel film to be like endgame, and this isn't it since that's not realistic. Recommend. It was fun to watch. I didn't watch any trailers over then the first one so there was a lot of surprises in the for me. It makes me excited for the next films to come out. The end credit seems were exciting and were like the other films were they were just joke ones. The characters were exciting and not boring. They were also some fun new characters which I hope to see again. It's a very good watch for the start of phase 5 and it's essential to see. Overall I love it!"
6," Not a Bad Movie.. but Not Great Either.. Something to Watch.
",dan_slentz,/user/ur43350397/,17 February 2023,"Reel Tunez Movie Review (2/17/23): ""Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania""Have to say it certainly wasn't the best of the Ant Man movies. Nearly the entire thing was done with digital backgrounds and effects, and some looked pretty rushed and not ""convincing"" (at least for the ability of digital technology). The story line was fair, and seeing Bill Murray is always cool (though very short). Evangeline Lilly is an actress I enjoy seeing and think she's great, so that certainly helped the movie. But it just lacked the ""pizazz"" of the typical well-done Marvel action/adventure. I love to promote seeing movies AT the theaters because they should be a special experience, but the effects and digital animation may be more convincing on a big TV. It's another Marvel movie, so remember to stay until the very very end so you can see the extra stuff (one during credits and one after).On a 1-10 scale, I'd give it a 5.6. Remember that my scale is tough (unlike others who seem to think a mediocre movie is a 7, and an okay movie is an 8). Above a 5 is something I consider worth seeing (you won't wish for the two hours of your life back), and 4.9 and under is a ""regret"". So I'd give this a 5.6."
5," This is more or less a stand alone MCU movie
",winstontroy,/user/ur69974737/,17 February 2023,I thought this movie was going to kick off Kang's entrance into the MCU but i do not feel like it did that at all. If you saw Loki then you know who Kang is and this movie will give you very little new information on that character. I do not feel like this film really add anything new to the story with the exception of the end credit scenes. There was no really moral of the story or underlying message. The jokes seemed to fall flat and were poorly timed at moments that felt like there were supposed to be more serious than funny. I look to Marvel to be incredible story tellers and world building. This movie did not meet my expectations for that. Any MCU movie has the ability to be an incredibly meaningful and powerful film while also being a stepping stone to lead up to a larger film.
3," What has happened to Marvel?
",Nixon_Carmichael,/user/ur48295655/,17 February 2023,"I don't mean to be disrespectful to anyone involved, I know that nobody sets out to make a bad movie. Yet again though, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is yet another PG13, CGI mud fest.So when we pick up, Paul Rudd's Scott Lang is walking down the streets of San Francisco underneath the theme song from Welcome Back, Kotter....After a quick voiceover the characters are inexplicably flung into the throes of a Star Wars, CGI, acid trip. Even though some of the visuals are interesting, this movie has no discernible plot. It is literally just one, big CGI mud fest after another. If you told me that this movie was written by a third grade boy on a sugar, I wouldn't fall out of my chair in the shock.The true crime here is that for months on end, Marvel have touted Quantumania as ""An Avengers Level Event"", which was clearly a blatant lie. At the end of the film, nothing has taken place.It's a crying shame."
7," Enjoyable Despite Criticism
",PyroSikTh,/user/ur5261700/,17 February 2023,"I didn't dislike this movie, let me be clear. I had a good time with it, especially when talking about the villains, and while I felt more could've been done with the Quantum Realm itself, this was a fun and creative space opera world to explore. But Quantumania is a story riddled with holes (unlike one of its best side characters) and inconsistencies, and doesn't particularly add to the MCU as a whole either. For a movie deemed the most important for the next phase of the movies, it didn't have any long-lasting effects at all. It's nowhere near as fun as its predecessors (Luis is sorely missed), and too many of the characters are annoying or frustrating to watch (or barely present at all). And then there's the CG world that lacks any frame of reference, and some really bizarre editing decisions. I give Quantumania an enjoyable yet flawed entry into the MCU canon; 7/10. But yeah, it's the villains that save this movie.QyrosMovies."
6," Confused and low stakes
",spacemanlorry,/user/ur111338805/,17 February 2023,"The film fails to give a feeling of any meaningful stakes to the viewer, and the quantum realm, where 95% of the movie is, feels fake and unappealing.The quantum realm, while initially dazzling, becomes boring and messy. The world feels unreal, and doesn't appeal to the audience. It has a disconnected feel, I couldn't associate one place as the interior of another, or realise, oh, that's the outside of that building.The stakes do not feel real, as, whenever faced with an obstacle the cast seem to easily defeat whatever faces them. The story mainly focuses on Cassy and Scott, for the most part neglecting the other characters and not fully exploring Janet's story."
6," ""Honey, We Shrunk Everything""
",xiaoli7377,/user/ur123364108/,17 February 2023,"""Quantumania"" was pretty entertaining. The standout from this film is obviously the introduction of Kang (Jonathan Majors) into the MCU. Another run of the mill Marvel film, nothing to crazy and it follows the very formulaic standard at this point. The computer effects and the green screen compositing in this one looked super off to me, I saw this in IMAX with a couple of friends and everything looked very digital like I was watching a video game cutscene. Some of the jokes landed, some fell flat on their face. MODOK (Corey Stoll) is mainly used as a throwaway sidekick for Kang and it's honestly just really goofy to see on the big screen and is not used to his full potential as a villain.This is another mediocre entry into Marvel's extremely lackluster Phase Four; I feel like this franchise has definitely lost all of it's steam and momentum after the conclusion of the Thanos saga. I had hopes that this one would finally be the one to break the series out of its lull, but I guess that we'll have to keep waiting for that. It's not terrible by any means, but it's one that will only really be remembered for the characters it introduces and not for the quality of the film itself."
7," Visuals Are Where It Shines, Literally And Figuratively, In This CGI Universe
",rannynm,/user/ur1257208/,17 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania manages to clench the undying thirst for the unknown within the Marvel Cinematic Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Universe, yet introduces so much that it doesn't really introduce anything at all. While being carried on the back of a strong performance by Jonathan Majors, Ant-Man: Quantumania is strictly a setup film, which is somewhat pointless, because it sets up what Marvel fans already know. Regardless of leaving little to no impact, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's visuals are where it shines, literally and figuratively. In a film that takes place almost entirely in a CGI world, Marvel creates its own Star Wars and perfects every minute computer generated detail.Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame, with the entire world rehabilitating, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania kicks off (or flies off, because... ants). The audience sees the new luxurious life of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) - Hero, father and self-proclaimed ""author."" The story quickly introduces the new struggle Scott has for raising his newly teenage daughter, Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). When Cassie reveals she has been tampering with Quantum Realm technology, it's too late. The whole Ant-Man crew gets shrunken down into the Quantum Realm (a subatomic world beneath Earth). The rest of the story follows the whole family venturing to find a way out of the realm, while Kang the Conqueror hunts them relentlessly.For the past couple years, Marvel has had major controversy regarding their CGI and VFX artists (mainly with their Disney+ shows). At least for Ant-Man: Quantumania, they seem to be back on track, or starting to be. The images are impeccable and matched with a strong score; the auditory and visual experience is automatically enhanced. IMAX is the correct way to view the film. Despite the irrelevant plot, Jonathan Majors conquers the show. He emphasizes the true power of Kang, with a blood-curdling scream that'll make sure he is thought about well after the credits roll. Although, the film fails to utilize him to the extent they could have, leaving the audience wanting more, and not in a positive way.Like all the other films put through the Marvel formula, this film does not disappoint with its fair share of comedy, foul language and violence. When dealing with a villain known for annihilating entire worlds and timelines, of course the audience will see a lot more than a simple punch thrown on the big screen. In terms of gore however, it does not go there to a large extent. Underneath the antics, the story pairs with a large theme of family, and teaches the moral that love of all kinds always perseveres.I give Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. You can find Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in theatres on February 17, 2023. Make sure to check it out! By Jude A., KIDS FIRST!"
7," Delightful romp into decidedly underdeveloped
",moatandbailey,/user/ur95068485/,17 February 2023,"... corner of the MCU. Scientific jargon tends to flow easily enough through a fair share of MCU films, particularly the better and best ones. The purpose seems to be to ground the story into something concrete, tangible and accessible, some relatable terra firma to allow us the audience even further immersion into the viewing experience. It's a neat story-telling device, which Ant Man has employed through all his movies so far- culminating in no less than the term quantum mechanics being integrated into the title of his third outing. And so ""Quantumania"" perseveres in the long MCU tradition of playing fast and loose with austere scientific concepts to engage the audience in a wild fantastic evidently neverending adventure. ""Quantumania"" isn't MCU's best, but it upholds the MCU's most tried and true science fiction fantasy tradition. And just as in science, once all the phases come into play, the sum should amount to greater than its parts. Ant Man has now cast his part in the lot, to be tallied later down the line, and it is a good part, if a bit part, from the character most likely to be overlooked- except for one thing: quantum mechanics, applied and theoretical, is a huge deal..! So here's to Ant Man- the hero no one cares about, but can't do without...!"
6," Kang The Conqueror
",johnnyhbtvs27,/user/ur23138296/,17 February 2023,"Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is the first movie of Phase 5 for Marvel yet never really gets off the ground. It continues Marvel's recent trend of producing bloated CGI messes.There is nothing wrong with Ant-Man 3 yet it is so spectacularly average you can't help but wonder what could have been with the Quantum Realm with a better script and more time.It has all the usual Marvel beats with comedic nods to other Avengers, characters there to be the wise cracking humour of the piece eg. Veb, M. O. D. O. K. They provide some funny moments but once the usual last 30 minutes of huge CGI battles occurs, interest wanes.The real star of Ant-Man 3 is Kang The Conqueror. Kang is who we are all here to see and he doesn't disappoint. Jonathan Majors is fantastic in the role and i can't wait to see him out in the open and tackling the other Avengers.There are some nice cameos from Tom Hiddleston, Owen Wilson & especially Bill Murray, who is great as Lord Krylar with his screen time limited. Kathryn Newton does well taking over as Cassie Lang and makes me think a Young Avengers could work.Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is on the lower tier of Marvel movies but with it's inclusion it sets up Phase 5 nicely and I'm intrigued to see what's to come."
7," Not amazing, but not bad.
",eh_ustun,/user/ur152630815/,17 February 2023,"This film had quite a lot that I liked about it but also quite a lot that I disliked. Nevertheless, the bad was just small things so my rating is still fairly higher than what I expected to give this.This film felt like a filler movie as a way of introducing Kang more.I'll start off with what I disliked and what I think many will dislike.1. The script. I found myself predicting a lot of what people would say and it's things I've heard in many many movies before. Overall quite cliche and cringe.2. Boring/rushed at times. I ended up not caring about scenes I should be caring about. The way they all ended up in the quantum realm at the start of the film was partially why I did not enjoy the first 30 minutes of the film or so. The plot did not feel complex at all. It feels like the type of story I would write in a typical school literary test.What I did like?Kang. Although his quotes too could have been better (again bad script), they were the best in the movie. His overall presence was fear inducing and I loved every minute of Jonathan Majors in this role. I think he has incredible potential for future movies IF well-written.A small note is that although the film was about 90% CGI, it wasn't bad. Even Modok's face. No real complaints there unlike Thor L&T cause man was that bad. Speaking of Modok, he was awesome too. They did not exaggerate the humour too much in this movie despite it being Ant-man. It wasn't over the top ridiculous and it didnt ruin the serious parts of the film, again unlike Thor L&T. The final battle was intense, I genuinely thought Scott was gonna die. It was bloody, it made me change my rating from 6 to 7 as I watched.I conclude by saying that this movie is worth watching and currently at a rating of 6.6 I believe that is harsh and slightly underrated. It's a fun watch. Not too relevant, maybe a bit of a money grab, but fun."
7," Paul Rudd delivers in latest in triology with new tone
",pacepr,/user/ur156362332/,17 February 2023,"I am not a fan of Paul Rudd as an actor. I find his movies historically to be more stupid than substantial. I only prefer him in more grounded subtler titles like Fundamentals of Caring and The Perks of Being a Wall Flower. Ant-Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp were a step in the right direction from the I Love You Man's and Our Idiot Brother's and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was a leap.In a movie where you encounter outlandish beings from the quantum realm (don't play a drinking game with the word quantum; you will die), I just need you to be a dad, and he was at his best in this movie.Kang was the star; I enjoyed Cassie more than expected. Everyone else was fine. I'll accept the floating head. Is it a CGI mess? Absolutely, but the story edges it out with a lot of promise for the Kang Saga.I'd give it 7.25 if I could."

The synergy between the actors was terrible actually there was no synergy at all.I just came back from the theater and i can barely remember the movie. Usually when i watch a movie i don't care about what time is it, but this time i checked my watch at least 5 time, it was boring. I don't know what marvel are trying to do with the last movies but in my eyes they spit on the amazing universe they were built for the last 15 years.Overall i prefer Eternals and Iron man 3 over Quantumania.Only the post credit scenes were good.Sorry for the bad english I'm new in itğŸ˜…"

",louiccooreman,/user/ur86618823/,17 February 2023,"This movie was definitly a fun movie to watch , it had greater visual effects than expected from a marvel piece these times so its great to see that theyÂ´re actually improving on CGI.To me it felt like this movie was pure to build up phase 5 of the MCU by really introducing Kang and what a danger he could be in the new phase , however for an Ant-Man movie this was a bit less of what I would have expected , the story was a bit off and I dont really like how they made Ant Man win from Kang the conqueror ?? I mean??? What? This guy litterally has a whole avengers movie planned about him and is litterally one of the biggest villains in the mcu ? I know that kang is not technically done but I feel like theyÂ´ve made him seem a bit weak.One of my favorite parts of the movie was the reveal of MODOK , they didnÂ´t go wrong there at all , it was perfect how they build up the hype for him and they also gave him a good story and a good ending.Overall I enjoyed the movie and definitly advise you to go watch."
5," Set up for the future
",Entertainmentsparadise,/user/ur131752399/,17 February 2023,"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantummainia was very mid. There were no highs nor lows, and I felt like I was driving Ms. Daisy around. What was the point?To set up the terror Kang, the Conqueror will reign in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Okay, then show that or leave it for a Disney plus special, but as a Marvel fan, I expected more for the big stage.Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantummainia doesn't find its tone or establish any conquered aspects that allow it to stand out. The movie felt less about ant man. There wasn't much comical appeal compared to the first one; they tired with Modok's huge face and some jokes about sexual creature experience, there's no love aspect, just set up, and I'm not convinced nor intrigued by what's presented.The possibility of Kang is promising, although why watch a movie for a promising for the future? For such a dynamic antagonist, it could've done more. The power on display was one of my favorite parts, but there wasn't enough action. Ant-man attempts to introduce us to a new world in the quantum verse, but it doesn't stick; it's so outrageous that it isn't relatable and somewhat illogical.Verdict: Ultimately this movie disappoints and gives us the same quality of marvel films we've been accustomed to since the new phase. Marvel needs a blockbuster quick; it needs to establish its tone bc these lackluster films don't meet standards.I rate it 5/10.Grade : D +
Plot: D
Action: C
Execution: D."

",mattnish-66853,/user/ur162139457/,17 February 2023,"I was crossing my fingers for this one, due to the last few mcu showings... although the movie wasn't terrible it also wasn't great. Jonathan majors is amazing and definitely Carried this movie. Everyone else's performance was .. well just a overall normal performance but nothing exciting due to them trying to really get a feel of the quantum realm. Tbh the first introduction into the quantum realm was quite cool but the cgi and the constant dry dialogue made it to be very grey and made me very impatient for the film to be over with. The wardrobe and setting for the quantum realm looked like recycled items from the Star Wars set and also the Languages as well. It felt really unoriginal at times.. also what felt typical of mcu was the story line.. we have yet again U. S. earthers discovering a new world and help defending it from an over taking evil to regain its freedom blah blah blah.. I understand mcu is building character development but can we take a new direction? An overall 6/10 for me I'm a big Paul Rudd fan but the direction of this Film didn't move me. The importance of this film is the 2 post credit scenes that play a big roll in the mcus future which I am excited for just for kang dynasty and secret wars but that is all."
3," Marvel's Latest: A Disappointing Entry That Falls Short of Its Predecessors
",RealCharlesTsui,/user/ur58780160/,17 February 2023,"Unfortunately, the most recent film in the franchise falls short of the standards that its predecessors set. As a viewer, you have high expectations for a movie set in this universe, but this one falls short. It feels like a paint-by-numbers superhero movie instead of having the allure and mystery that made the previous installments so popular.The movie makes an effort to convey a sense of urgency and high stakes, but it fails. It's difficult to comprehend Kang's actions because of his poor motivations. Because of this, the conflict seems manufactured, and the movie's climax is unimpressive. Being relegated to a two-dimensional antagonist for a character with so much potential is frustrating.The film's visual effects unquestionably save it, but they are limited in what they can accomplish. Although the CGI is visually appealing and technically sound, it lacks the ""wow"" element that we have come to associate with Marvel films. The visual style of the movie is flat and uninteresting, and the action scenes, which are few and far between, are easy to get bored of.The plot appears incoherent and the narration is poor, with a slow pacing. It's challenging to care about the destiny of the characters because they are underdeveloped. It's difficult to help but wonder what may have happened if the filmmaking team had taken more chances and pushed the envelope.In conclusion, practically every aspect of this movie is a letdown. It's a bland installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that falls short of emulating the wonder and thrill of its forerunners. It's difficult to suggest for anyone other than ardent fans, however you might find something to like here if you are one. We can only hope that the franchise will learn from this error and resume providing the exciting and inventive storytelling that we've grown to enjoy."

But I find it at bit silly that a teenage girl accidentally turns on a homemade device, and then the hero's access the Quantum realm.... It's a thin point to kickstart a new face. The story seems unnecessary. However it's quite entertaining, because of Poul Rudd! So all the probs to him. It's much more a sify movie than a regular marvel movie, in that sense it feels more like a guardians of the galaxy movie but less charming.....The post credit scene reveals a bit for the future to come.

Not many jokes either, unless I missed them and they weren't funny. Only laughed twice I think.Fighting scenes were good as well as character detail but story was bit poor. Almost like it was a part 1, which I suppose it was.

5," A Disappointing Sequel That Fails to Measure Up
",Sophiaphage,/user/ur2331600/,17 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is like a rollercoaster ride that forgot to go up. The movie's pacing is so sluggish, it's like the filmmakers decided to throw in a few naps for the audience. At a runtime of 118 minutes, it's about as long as an average flight to Europe, but with less excitement and worse food.MODOK, the film's villain, looks like something a toddler would come up with after eating too much candy. The character's design and animation are so unconvincing, it makes the Gummi Bear look like a realistic portrayal. He looks like a leftover from a Power Rangers episode. If the film's writers had spent as much time on VFX as they did on naming him, we might have had a more menacing and memorable villain.It feels like it's trying too hard to be funny, like a clown who's had a few too many drinks. At this point, the MCU's humor is about as fresh as bread from a gas station. Many of the jokes feel forced, and there are times when the humor feels like a crutch to keep the audience engaged. While some of the comedic moments are genuinely funny, others feel out of place.Finally, the MCU approach to representation continues to be problematic. These films continue to prioritize promoting women and side-characters while reducing the usually male legacy characters to caricatures and punchlines. The movie's approach feels like it's trying too hard to be feminist, like a guy wearing a ""This is what a feminist looks like"" t-shirt. It's like the filmmakers are saying, ""Look, we have women doing cool things, isn't that neat?""The only thing worse than watching this movie is being stuck in a time loop where you're forced to watch it over and over again."

",dholleyuk,/user/ur28795157/,17 February 2023,"This is certainly not the worst marvel film of recent years but it is certainly the worst Ant-man film. Gone is the humour and character we have come to like, Hope is shoved to the sidelines for most of this film so not sure why Wasp is even in the title.It spends more time with CGI from Dr Strange then it does with any characters, their development or plot.For most of the film I couldn't wait for the end - it was devoid of any risk as it was set in a cgi world.Sadly a complete waste of 2hrs and couldn't even stay for the post credit film - sadly I think I am done with Marvel films after this!"

I gave it a 10 although I have a few questions and would have liked the Quantum Realm defined better. But all that is nitpicking. Definitely a very solid start to Phase 5. It did it's job and introduced Kang properly. The post credit scenes are amazing. Both are teasing future Kang.I am a big fan of the multiverse and really like thinking about it. This movie gave us another solid intro of what is to come. I can barely wait for Loki Season 2 and the upcoming movies where everyone fights Kang.

Rather than calling it movie its a motivational video where you out number an enemy even though u r injured or less in number. At the end what they did to M. O. D. O.

",slightlymad22,/user/ur4465293/,17 February 2023,"I just got out of Antman & The Wap45 minutes of adverts and trailers ðŸ˜¡ the longest since no time to die. Cinemas really need to sort this out. I paid money to sit an watch a movie at 15:00 it didn't start until 15:45!!Spoiler free reviewThis does not course correct the MCU. Based on the trailers, I didn't have high expectations and I was still disappointed and underwhelmed, as I loved the first Ant-Man and liked the follow up. That said it was still OK.There are somethings I liked, Paul Rudd was his usual likeable self. Jonathan Majors was a decent enough Kang, at least for the first half of the movie. There is a good family drama underneath all the cgi nonsense, that really should have been the movies main plot point. It works when it's about the family. I thought Michelle Pfeiffer was great and I really liked Michael Douglas, too!!Did they recast the daughter??What I didn't like, was once it got down to it,in the second half, Kang was just another disposable Marvel bad guy. Bill Murray was a distraction and this will not help his career.A big problem for me was it bottled what could have been a great ending. It looked like it was leading to a something I would have liked and then it went in another direction. I also would have liked to have spent more time with Jentorra played by Katy O' Brian. She has a decent sized role, I wanted more of her.All in all, I'm it's down there with the bottom half of the MCU movies for me, but not right down there with Thor 2 and Iron Man 2There were seven other people in my screening.

",jaynesastar,/user/ur162428117/,17 February 2023,"Brilliant film, typical cringe moments but that's what ant man is about! Overall fantastic, loved the cgi and story. No messing around at straight to the point and story got going right away. Much better watch than black panther. Kang and lang fight scene was nail biting! The type of colonies living down there was interesting too. Yesss the ants was back as well. Cannot wait to see where these characters head next amazing storyline and Scott lang has come along way and I love the connections of the familyAmazing go and see it if you haven't yet !!!Final final post cred scene ðŸ˜€fantastic....."
5," Good Visual Bad Story
",saudraheem-00098,/user/ur92292554/,17 February 2023,"""Ant Man and Wasp: Quantumania"" is an incredible addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, providing a thrilling ride from start to finish. The film is an excellent blend of action, humor, and heart, keeping the audience engaged throughout the entire runtime. The chemistry between the lead characters, played by Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, is palpable, and the supporting cast brings their A-game to the table. The special effects and visual design of the quantum realm are breathtaking, taking the viewers on an unforgettable journey. The plot twists and turns keep you guessing until the end, and the film is sure to satisfy fans of the comic book series as well as casual moviegoers. Overall, ""Ant Man and Wasp: Quantumania"" is a must-see movie, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves superhero films."
8," C'mon It's not that bad!!
",abirchy-96827,/user/ur134959333/,17 February 2023,"At first I read the reviews before watching the movie. If anyone is reading this, then will now that most of the reviews are kinda bad. So I almost had no expectation before watching the movie... But after watching it my view changed...
I personally enjoyed it a lot....Phase-5 started with a blast!!!Spoiler Part :::::::
I think they didn't justify Modok too much like ""Taskmaster"" in Black Widow..But that's not a big problem as Modok is not the main villain,, Kang is... Kang The Conqueror's (exiled one) story and action scenes were greatly organized. I personally liked it... Some people may have problem with Kang being defeated in the end by Scott and Wasp.. I also personally think that shouldn't have happened as in the future Kang Dynasty will happen... But it's not like the end of the world. There are lots of good things in the movie.. Dialogues were also good....Midcredit scene really showed a clip of Kang Dynasty. Just waiting how Avengers will fight with all those Kang variants...Post credit scene will blow everyones mind. Our beloved Loki is back.. I am interesting to find out who actually that Kang variant is in the post credit scene as Who He Remains is dead.. Can't wait for Loki Season 2.."
8," Fine introduction to phase 5
",medinan-18452,/user/ur58957746/,17 February 2023,"Am I missing something? I've seen multiple reviews call this the worst movie they've ever seen. It wasn't too long, it introduced Kang and was constantly giving us new information. Yea some of the humor was childish but I personally thought they had a good mix of darkness as well. Yet another good movie falling victim to hype. I myself have seen every marvel movie to date and definitely had high expectations for this movie. But after watching it I'm not sure what more I could've asked for? People are saying Kang didn't seem like a threat and that's just insane to me. He Was killing at will in the end and the only reason his powers were slightly nerfed was because he was in the quantum realm and time doesn't truly exist there."
8," A great opening to phase 5
",mohamedelbouhali-24612,/user/ur162018130/,17 February 2023,"I'm actually not a big fan of ant man's movies and I always can't take them seriously but this movie is different we have a dangerous villain kang, we have threat I was scared that ant mancould die . So let's talk about things I loved about the movie first of all kang this villain is amazing I liked them more thanos he was charismatic. Jonathan majors did a phenomenal job I also like Scot's daughter she was good but I didn't like how they abandoned hope she has a lot of potential in addition I hated the first part and it was kinda boring ""I was waiting for kang "" and about the end it was fine."
5," Very generic and too normal
",noobz13,/user/ur151638096/,17 February 2023,"How do i describe this movie in one word? Well i would say this movie is ""Generic"". To tell the truth my expectations for this movie are very low since Phase 4 is a bit disappointing these past few years. I would say this movie is a great start for phase 5 in the MCU, the story is good enough, the acting is good especially Jonathan Majors acting as Kang, The CGI looks good as usual but what makes this movie so generic is that there's no uniqueness at all. It really feels normal for MCU movies nowadays to don't have that love or effort built in to it. And man No Luis? (Michael Pena) damn it feels not normal at all for an Antman movie not including him at all."
1," Such a waste
",haleymichelson-78872,/user/ur131156957/,17 February 2023,"Hard to believe that this is the result of a massive 200 million dollar budget. Think of the good that kind of money could do in the world. But instead, it's just a rehashed, boring, tired, unoriginal sludge and waste of time. Clearly the Marvel cult members will praise any garbage that comes out, but for any sane / rational person it's just pathetic. I had a bad feeling about it the minute I saw the previews using Elton John's ""Rocketman"" song, which of course is the them song to Elton's own film. How sad that this fluff is even allowed to be released, but I guess that's the state of Hollywood these days. Pathetic."
9," Don't understand the bad reviews, it's was a great movie
",Luce1417,/user/ur79476013/,17 February 2023,"Went to watch last night with my family and expected nothing. Phase four was quite disappointing besides Shang-chi so this movie starting phase 5 is quite nice.don't understand the bad reviews, it was fun, entertaining, funny, not too long and it introduces Kang.The CG is always is nice, don't know how I feel about Modok but that's what marvel wanted so whatever. Not going to blame the overworked CG artists for anything. Marvel is responsible for the look of any CG.The quantum works was quite nice, love all the small creatures.The plot is great too, there isn't any boring sequences, the whole time there was information flying around. Made you understand Kang a bit better, was a bit bothered how easily it was to kill him untill I read on the comics that he always gets killed but his variants always comes back so I'm okay with it.Loved all the minor characters in the quantum world, the blobs and the mind reader. They were quite funny. Overall my kids love it, we loved it and it was great Introduction to phase five. The post credit scenes were great too, was happy to see Loki again and connect this movie to the show.9/10."
2," Just bad...
",castielminion1,/user/ur21931238/,17 February 2023,"This was terrible. I've seen and liked the first two Ant Man films but wasn't fanatical about them. After this I doubt anyone will be about any more Ant Man outings.The story was all over the place and everything could have been avoided if Janet had actually had even a brief discussion about her time in the Quantum Realm. Cassie shouldn't have opened the portal I grant you, but based on the limited info Janet had given it was an empty realm. She wasn't expecting any of this and quite rightly so in my opinion.Then there were so many plot holes and bad writing decisions that I could be here all day. The one that jumped out at me was the ending. Hope comes back and she and Scott work together and kill Kang. But instead of going back through the portal (which they both know is only open for a limited time), they stand and watch Kang die- even though he can't possibly escape from the core. They stand there and watch and let it close up. Rather than have them stay there and have a major plot twist, it's all ok because Cassie opens another portal and brings them home. No jeopardy here!The side characters were forgettable- there was a guy who can read minds, a thing obsessed with having holes in his body, the leader of the resistance and weirdly, Bill Murray. The last one was shoehorned in for two reasons-
1. So they could say this was a Bill Murray film, even though he was there for less than 5 minutes.2. So they could steal his plane thing.Darren, the villain from the first film was back, but as a caricature that looked like a floating Humpty Dumptey. The villain was ok, just a shame his efforts were clouded by a poor film!The main actors looked like they wanted to be anywhere else and honestly I can't blame them. Kathryn Newton was... not great. All in all not a great film, so watch at your own risk!"
4," When Particle Worlds Collide...
",Xstal,/user/ur4103165/,17 February 2023,"We're all sucked into a world of microcosm, it's quite familiar, but it's also quite an odd'n, a galaxy of failed auditions, inept, forgetful compositions, it's recycled, reinvented, repetition. It's fair to say, the dialogue's a chore, excessive CGI that soon becomes a bore, there is very little spark, to a disengaging arc, at least the runtime's not excessive (although still too long for what it delivers), you don't want more - which is a shame, because Jonathan Majors is a seriously talented chap, but as Kang The Conqueror, he deserves no big backslap, while Bill Murray plays Bill Murray, though neither humorous or funny, and the also rans are outplayed by the ants - while the rest of the cast take their green screen cash and disappear into a multiverse of madness."
9," A Kang Movie
",cthirlby,/user/ur136469273/,17 February 2023,"Was really hyped for this one, the start of phase 5 and kicking it off with a finally serious ant-man movie with Kang! I was most excited for Kang in this one and I got what I wanted so I'm happy. Ant-Man getting a serious movie was very different but really cool to see him taking a situation fully seriously in his own movie. Modok is in this movie and I know Modok from the shows and comics so his look I knew it would look odd as it's hard to pull that off in love action and take it seriously but I'm happy with what they did with the design, also all the jokes with him when he died and in general were hilarious. Cassie Lang is all grown up and gets some screen time, she had a cute relationship with her dad but apart from that I didn't get super excited for her, or any other characters besides Ant-Man and Kang really. Ant-Man you get to see at his peak of sorts with him fully capable of using his powers and able to grow to immense sizes, he held his own in this movie too with a brutally cool fight scene. My main takeaway and what this movie was truly about though was Kang and thank god cause I love Kang! His attitude and personality showing how cunning, dangerous and intelligent he is makes me even more into him as a character. Love the design of the suit and seeing what he is capable of. All the lore for Kang too and the multiverse war I ate up! Loved it loved it loved it! It's just the way he operates that makes him so badass! Unfortunately when he died (I think) I was like damn that sucks I loved that variant but the end credits with the council of Kangs!!! YES! Can't wait to see them all and more Kang screen time, love that character. I got a tiny bit annoyed at how often the characters removed their helmets purely just to not hide the stars faces which happened a lot but it's not a massive issue. Overall I enjoyed Ant-Man mostly for Kang (I'm saying Kang a lot whoops) but he was really such a rich character to dive into so I'm glad there was a lot of that."
3," Same thing again
",tremault-08547,/user/ur135262659/,17 February 2023,"This was really disastrous combination. The Antman films have come to be known for comedic moments so when they pivoted to such a serious story with such a supposedly threatening and monumental bad guy, you expect a tone change, but then along comes a certain character and brings down the whole thing with absolutely pathetic humour and the worst looking special effects I've seen in years. This is on the level of Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut, or Jar Jar Binks. It's really bad.Then there is the tropes that have become all too common for mcu movies at this point; large scale battle, cross cutting between individual characters, misplaced comedy... All detracts from at least one really powerful moment, that could have made the core of a fantastic movie, a moment when Scott regains his focus and works toward one goal rather than being drawn in all directions, that was very powerful.This is just the latest MCU product though and exhibits the same issues that I have been starting to notice in the past few years. At this point it's hard to ignore and it's stifling any creativity and good storytelling. This will probably be the last MCU movie I pay for."
5," It's inoffensive blockbuster stuff.
",Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,/user/ur24085266/,17 February 2023,"**Possible spoiler territory ahead**Ant-Man 3 has the unenviable position of being a threequel and something-nth addition to a long-running cinematic (media) franchise that's starting to exhaust itself beyond innovation-driven-repair.Ant-Man 3 has some FABULOUS special effects throughout its runtime, but the story beats and action payoffs feel too similar to other MCU films we've seen before; and it's unfortunate that this is the case because Kang is genuinely FANTASTIC as a villain, but the script is too safe for such an infamously chaotic character and rule-set for multiverse-driven stories.In other words, this is a safe spectacle that is just that: it's perfectly watchable and serviceable as an entry-level film for MCU newcomers, but for anyone else they MAY be expecting a little more considering the critical and audience acclaim the rest of the universe (mostly) seems to have gotten thus far.Ant-Man 3 is the definition of blockbuster cinema and the kind of staple action cinema many have come to define in their broad generalisations of the action-adventure genre today. For better or for worse, this is a typical movie's typical movie.Ant-Man 3 gets 2.5/5 stars. It's not nearly as insufferable as other MCU films like Eternals or Thor 2, but there's stronger films to (re)watch for anyone else looking for engaging and genuinely refreshing stories on-screen.P. S. If I'm being totally frank, Kang should have been THE main character as opposed to Ant-Man. The film was so fixated on this new guy that it was BEGGING for a more focused screenplay based solely on Kang (or at least the scope of the man's abilities and terror). It seems like Ant-Man was attached to make it a safer bet for Disney."
7," A fun watch with stunning visuals but lacks depth
",cinephile-007,/user/ur69717177/,17 February 2023,"Quantamania is a typical marvel movie with grand visuals and a story that has pretty much nothing to offer.Katheryn Newtown seems like a good choice for Cassie lang. Let's hope she has more to offer in the future.As for the story,it gives us the first look at much anticipated Kang the Conqueror and Jonathan Majors has done a phenomenal job in potraying the big bad. But after all those build-ups and hype surrounding Kang as the big bad for this saga, i kinda felt they downplayed him in the movie. For someone as powerful as Kang to go down like that seemed like an injustice to the character.Overall, quantamania is a fun watch but is forgettable once you walk out the theatres. Jonathan Majors is the stand out of the film and am excited for what he holds in the future."
8," A great fun superhero film..
",marwinsingh-30063,/user/ur97721990/,17 February 2023,"Ant man and the wasp quantamania is a big step up from previous two films in trilogy, it sets up future of MCU's Multiverse saga meanwhile providing a good entertainment.. Visuals were great, story was good , action scenes were enjoyable everyone delivered a great performance especially Majors as KANG THE CONQUEOR, Paul Rudd was also great as ant man like previous mcu apperances.. It had some pacing issues but an epic 3rd act makes up for everything.. Final battle was really amazing and was on a big scale it also had some tense moments.. There is also a little bit of comedy, some good jokes.. Overall film is great which concludes this trilogy in a small big way meanwhile setting up stages for mega event movies AVENGERS THE KANG DYNASTY and AVENGERS SECRET WARS.. This film also acts as an introduction of Kang who is the main big bad of phase 5.... In last I want to say you can enjoy this film in cinema as an fun superhero action adventure movie featuring our favorite Marvel heroes and villains you won't be dissapointed especially young kids will enjoy this film very much... And hardcore MCU fans like me can't miss this one as we love all marvel projects....Thanks for reading."
6," Surface Level Popcorn Flick
",mduggan-35724,/user/ur153060734/,17 February 2023,"The positives here are the actors and visuals. Paul Rudd has enough charisma to Cary his role and Jonathan Majors plays a convincing, dark villain. Unfortunately the tones of each character are wildly different giving the entire film a muddled feel. The quantum realm has a lot of fun Star Wars-esque visuals and goofy characters. However, the relationships between characters are surface level usually going no further than highlighting the fact that Cassie is indeed Scott's daughter. There is no character development here either; Every character ends the movie with the same motivations and morality that they started with. There are a lot of cheesy jokes and one liners that did not hit for me but had some of the audience laughing. Overall I think this is one worth watching for the spectacle and never revisiting."

",cmarlborough,/user/ur120370129/,17 February 2023,"Not sure what everyone's problem is- Marvel is moving on to a new storyline, if you don't like it then stop watching! I like the multiverse story- it brings a bit more depth to things. Love Paul Rudd and interested to see where they are going with the new villain. Also great to see Loki in the second end credit. Yes- you have to have Disney plus to really keep on track with the whole film/series split but I quite like that, give us all something to watch in between the films! And they do need to bring in the next generation so Cassie is a good addition to the crew.Overall I'm still very much onboard. Can't wait for Guardians!"
9," Ant-Man and the Wasp: Not so much. Kang though. Let me tell you.
",razormonkey,/user/ur140980612/,17 February 2023,"There's a thin line between the MCU fans and the Marvel fans who read the comics. I know Kang the Conqueror to the bone and I was fed every ounce that which he is. The MCU nailed him. The rest of the film may be rocky and slow at some point with the typical corny jokes that are intended for a Marvel movie. MODOK easily fell short of who he is in the comics and they filled him with half witted jokes and boring dialogue. This was not Modok. This is the mcu's Yellowjacket as a baby, so do the fans a favor and fix that. In the long run, Thanos is about 0 threat compared to what's coming of Kang. The heroes will have a run for their money and please marvel please. Kill your heroes. Have the stakes raised. Kang should dominate the screen as he's dominated comic book panels for years and years. Make it happen Kevin! And make Kang conqueror all that is. We need it!"

The exchange between Cassie and Modok towards the end was plain embarrassing.Kang is Thanos lite, he possess none of the gravitas and menace of him, and to build a whole saga around this character is terrible. How he is defeated at the end of the film is truly ridiculous.The CGI on Modok is eye rollingly awful, I literally laughed out loud when I saw this abomination on the screen.The end credits just bad, really bad. The first one made me laugh once more time, I won't spoil it for everyone but how did they think this was going to generate more interest on the whole Multiverse saga ??.Terrible CGI overload, and an uninspired script makes for a cinema trip which is the equivalent of sucked out of an airlock into a void of cold dark space."
6," A Lackluster beginning to Marvel's Phase 5
",marveltstodd,/user/ur67301378/,17 February 2023,"What works:
Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne.A great little surprise cameo by Bill Murray.Paul Rudd has always been well cast as Ant-Man/Scott Lang, same with Evangeline Lilly as The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne.Its obvious Jonathan Majors is very talented.The problem:
Like with the MCU's Phase 4 clear direction to the audience where this story is going. We need a central character like Iron Man/ Tony Stark to follow like in Phases 1-3 and a well defined threat for the individual characters and eventually a team of Avengers.The beginning of the Young Avengers, I'm excited to see this new team form which I'm sure will include Cassie Lang. However, the audience still has characters from Phases 1-3 that need more plot and time like The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne. The character is cast perfectly and the film forgets she is there during most of it.In this film as well as the ending of ""Loki"" Season One, Kang is difficult in my view to see as a threat. This was a great opportunity to make the audience scared of this character by showing some sort of shocking action sequence or demise of a major character in the MCU.The special effects in the Quantum realm look great, however the Modok character looks surprisingly AWFUL.Modok - please never mention this character again. Marvel what were you thinking here? YikesI'm getting nervous as these films through Phases 1-3 have had major success financially, critically, and with Marvel comic book fans. But something is very off starting with Phase 4. For every excellent film like ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" there is another project like ""She Hulk"" that is so bad it makes me embarrassed as a fan.The audience has seen what Marvel is capable of so when we consume projects like this, She Hulk, and Ms. Marvel, we know that something is wrong and we just want better projects again.Come on Marvel I believe in you! Lets get this universe back on track!"
5," Disappointing
",gretameno,/user/ur162422191/,17 February 2023,"This movie's characters are not well developed.Spoilers: Modok stopped being evil just because Cassie said that you could always choose not to be a dick,which is stupid. There wasn't any indication, to my knowledge, that he wanted to be good, until that scene.The second half of the movie was quite boring and the ending was very predictible.Lastly, it had that classic Hollywood thing of telling the viewers what the movie is about because they think we're to dumb to understand(Example:The scene I mentioned before)It had some funny moments, acting was okay too(loved W. J. Harper's performance in this),but overall disappointing.P. S. Sorry, for the grammar, English isn't my first language."
8," Great idea and concept
",rollaamalia,/user/ur68428723/,17 February 2023,"I read anyone who write that this movie is not good, thought that this is some sorts of fantasy-star-wars kind of movie. No it's not. Its concept is from science....if you understand, when you look through the microscope, you'll see microbes, cells, and getting smaller to atoms...that's the world is about. It's not another fantasy world. So, please begin to recall science to understand the concept of this movie.The movie is enjoyable. The plot is satisfactory. Kang is impressive. The quantum world is quite been explored. I think this would be an interesting opening for the next phase of MCU."
7," An above average addition to the super hero genre
",kevin_robbins,/user/ur131783850/,17 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Antman, Wasp and their now teenage daughter who is ready to be a super hero herself. Her research leads her into the Quantum realm where her grandmother has secrets about her past. As her grandmother's secrets surface the family and all existence becomes at risk.This movie is directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On) and stars Paul Rudd (I love you, Man), Jonathan Majors (Lovecraft Country), Michelle Pfeiffer (Scarface), Kirk Douglas (Falling Down), Evangeline Lilly (The Hobbit) and Kathryn Newton (Freaky).There was a lot to like about this movie. The cast is outstanding and everyone delivers a strong performance. Jonathan Majors was a tremendous villain and his mannerisms and the way he delivered his lines was perfect. The CGI and special effects to create the universe and the aliens in it were awesome. The makeup, masks and costumes were first rate. There were elements of the plot that were annoying, like how often Pfeiffer failed to inform her family about impending dangers, but the action sequences made up for where the storyline was flimsy.Overall, this is an above average addition to the super hero genre that I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing once."

Lots of ideas taken from older films, It also contains lots of ret-con just making stuff up as it goes along. I guess some of the actors do well with what've they got to work with, shame tho as I was looking forward to this, I guess it's time to wait for Marvel Movies to hit Disney+ n not waste money on cinema tickets. I feel the days of great Marvel movies is over, nothing good lasts forever... Another meh movie from Marvel since Tony clicked his fingers, RIP Marvel Movies."

I was came away surprised and pleased with the story and the visuals. The movie is NOT woke, not in the least. No f-words either.Very nice emphasis was placed on FAMILY and we need more of that.The colorful and intricate visuals seemed to outshine Avatar and the large pallette of different and freaky characters in this sub-atomic universe made for a visual feast. Better than Star Wars!Great action and great acting with all of the main actors getting equal time to shine. At least two plot twists. One or two of the jokes were cringe and there was one instance of TMI of a personal type.A very good starter to Phase 5 and a good set up for what is to come. It was an adventure, a bizarre road trip of sorts."

Then it feels like they force it on a team of writers and say ""hurry up and fill in blanks"" like a game of mad-libs.The filler scenes feels rushed and recycled from movies we've seen in Hollywood over and over again. Janet meets rebels and it ends with hugs and laughs and random filler scenes (here come the ants to save the day), lack of character building (expecting us to feel connected to random characters).It's sad that they don't just put in the work to create a story that keeps us on edge and makes us believe there is a threat. Amazing actors wasted."

The humor is genuine and not forced, Ant-Man finally shows some guts, and we finally get another Marvel villain that is as interesting and as complex as Thanos. After Endgame, Marvel truly let Bob Chapek drop the ball as the Disney CEO. Seemingly immediately after pushing him out, Marvel is back at making great movies that people want to see. I now only have high hopes for the release of Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and the next phase of Marvel. The only thing left to say is, if you want to continue seeing great movies like this, go support them, and let the studios know when you're not interested in half baked films."

-Jonathan Majors is great, can't wait to see more of him on screen.-We get some clear direction (which has been lacking) for what is to come in MCU.Cons:
-Visually underwhelming, nothing spectacular. At one point I felt like I was watching a spy kids movie (which is something I love, but the point is it was just not great).-Lame dialogue, which MCU sometimes pulls off as charming but didn't land here for me. The most clever one liners were spoiled in the trailers already.-A particularly absurd and annoying character that was wholly unnecessary to the plot development, but was necessary for the movie as it would otherwise be another unmemorable multiverse adventure."

",HabibieHakim123,/user/ur105506099/,17 February 2023,"8.5/10
I've always want to like Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania more than Ant-Man And The Wasp, and definitely not wanted to like it less than the first Ant-Man, and it all came down in the middle, even though in a lot of ways i do like Ant-Man And The Wasp better and sometimes this one better, but all the way through i enjoyed the movie and i can even safely say now after thinking about everything that's going down, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a good if not a great MCU movie in a long time for me, now, did i get the hate?, not really because i do get some of the cheesyness of it, some of the CGI for me if not all of them for everybody, and even though that was my real two problems of the film, besides that, i think the film are mostly great, in terms of the story, characters, and acting for the most part, it's a fun straight forward intense journey that takes place in this weird CGI fest world, and i enjoyed it, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang, Paul Rudd and the rest of his family was good, even Bill Murray have a very pleasant little appearance and performance in the film, but the one that absolutely deserve to be credited is Corey Stoll as MODOK, sure his CGI face wasn't that good and sometimes a bit too much but his performance is amazing and it's pretty caught me off guard, it's nice to see a good MCU movie again after two miss in a row for me (Thor: Love And Thunder and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), and overall Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a pretty great opening to the new Phase of the MCU."

I don't understand why critics or others are mad about these but as marvel fan even with expectations about this one since the trailer came ,I'm happy with it idk what more you want from this movie. If you are a marvel fan this is must watch since this movie is the core of something that's gonna lead to the next movies , so don't miss out on this and review this movies yourself not from those critics and keep this in mind sometimes or maybe most of the times critics are wrong that's all!"
10," Just Amazing!!!
",mohammadirfan274,/user/ur46992201/,17 February 2023,Just came back after the watch with my entire family..I don't know what movie many haters went n watched in cinemas!!Antman and wasp quantamania was too good!! Perhaps better than its previous two!! Its really amazing!! Yup it seems really like watching marvel star wars!Everyone had an important role but for me kathryn newton was everything!!She is too cute n full of heart!! She will shine in future mcu with other young avengers friends for sure!!Besides all jonathan majors as kang is MVP!! He is one hell of an actor!! Too scary as kang!!Go n watch the movie n decide it for urself!! Its really worth watching n giving it a try!!
10," Friendly reminder, Critics loved she-hulk
",rougxtozay,/user/ur155728723/,17 February 2023,"The critics are high on weed. Because of that they gave bad reviews to this film. It doesn't deserve any of the hate its getting. Audience has to remember this one starts the phase 5 and Kang is not an antman villain this kang is a mere variant of him. So dont watch this with an endgame expectation. Kang is an avenger level threat and we will get to see more of him in the kang dnasty. Now coming back to this movie, it had several goosebumps momments, especially the 2nd post credit scene, that got me offguard. Jonathan majors is just perfect for kang and paul rudd definitely adds up his own charm as well."
9," An Excellent, Fun, Weird, and Wacky Adventure Where The Stakes are High!
",wesleyarledge-86836,/user/ur77800330/,17 February 2023,"Whew!! What a way for Marvel to start Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and The Multiverse Saga!! Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania didn't disappoint! (Though there are two minor gripes I have with it that I'll get to in a moment).Right out of the gate this movie takes you on a journey that you've never been on before, namely to the Quantum Realm, which has been visited before in the Marvel movies but not to the extent that this movie does! It's weird and wonderful in all the right ways and the Quantum Realm's creatures and inhabitants (humanoids and alien like creatures alike) all give off huge Star Wars vibes, but I don't dislike it at all. It works and doesn't feel out of place. Heck, I'm sure if you shrunk down to beyond the size of dust mites yourself everything would look a little alien to you too. There's a colorful cast of new characters that are the inhabitants of the Quantum Realm and they all are weird, wacky, and wonderful, (and also wondering about holes; ""just drink the goo"").This movie also introduces us to the newest overarching baddie for all of Phase 5 & 6 in these movies and Disney+ shows named Kang The Conqueror, a god-like being who can travel through time, across dimensions, realities, and universes, who has gone up against The Avengers plenty of times before in the comic books and has easily won more than a few times. Kang proves in this movie that he is an even BIGGER threat to The Avengers and the Marvel Multiverse at large than Thanos was!! Kang is a terrifying villain, played wonderfully and with some Machiavellian glee by actor Jonathan Majors!! Majors did such a great job as Kang that he steals every scene that he's in. The character is so layered, that the movie only scratches the surface of Kang's broken psyche, and I cannot wait to see more of him going forward in the MCU!Actress Kathryn Newton also did an admirable job as the now almost adult Cassie Lang, who now has a suit very much like her father's. Throughout the movie she (much to Scott's chagrin, at first) learns to use the suit properly, as it does come with a learning curve for her, while Scott tries to sometimes hilariously teach her the ropes. She also wants to be like her father and help people and not turn a blind eye, and those situations get her into some hot water more than a couple of times, but she proves she can handle herself and becomes a superhero in her own right. Newton's performance as Cassie adds some depth and maturity to the character, and I won't be surprised if we see more of her in some form going forward!I also liked the addition of Bill Murray into the mix, who has a history with Janet from her time down in the Quantum Realm before her rescue. He plays his character the way you'd expect Bill Murray to play an over-the-top and exuberant character, and it adds some humor while also building up the tension to the plot even more!Quantumania is a movie whose set pieces are weird, wonderful, and sometimes wacky, but it all blends together and works well and the film gives off some heavy Star Wars vibes at times; that's not a bad thing at all, I loved it, because director Payton Reed and Marvel head Kevin Feige know how to make something bizarre work well within the confines of the psychics and the world that Stan Lee and the comics created. The movie is funny when it needs to be, and serious when it needs to be. It's a well put together film that doesn't feel clunky or slow. The stakes in this film are as serious as you can get, (the introduction of Kang, the possibility of Multiversal annihilation, those whole nine yards), but the movie is a nice blend of usual Ant-Man movie humor and seriousness and it all works well. Of the three Ant-Man movies, THIS ONE is my favorite of the three!There were a couple of things in the movie that I felt were lacking, and that I didn't like, though not completely dislike. Firstly, The Wasp character is treated almost like a side character and a sidekick instead of an equal superhero partner to Scott. It's almost as if the screenwriters downplayed her role in this movie and put more emphasis on Scott, Cassie, and Kang. The other dislike I had with the movie (though it's only a minor one) is that we didn't get enough time with Bill Murray's character in the movie, I would've liked to have seen more of him, and also the fact that I wish we could've seen more of what Janet's time in the Quantum Realm was like, other than the few flashbacks we got. There was definitely a little more to her story and her time there that was told, but not explicitly shown.This movie was a blast, and Marvel is certainly starting to turn up the dial on all the setting up they did in Phase 4, because this first entry in Phase 5 does not disappoint, and this'll leave you wanting more.Speaking of more, there is a mid credit and a post credit scene, both of which YOU CAN'T MISS, because it sets the stage for what we can expect going forward, and there are a couple of unexpected and BIG surprises and reveals!!Quantumania is a Marvel movie that feels wacky and wonderful in all the right ways. If you thought Doctor Strange in The Multiverse of Madness was a mind altering trip on acid, wait until you see this!"
6," Journey to the center of the quantum realm
",hexx-52214,/user/ur63107562/,17 February 2023,"I was so hyped about this movie for almost a year. After the spider man no way home this is the movie i was waiting for. I had huge expectations . But as mj said ""Expect disappointment and you'll never be disappointed."" After disappointing releases such as thor love and thunder , miss marvel , she hulk, Wakanda forever its just another slight disappointment . Theres no storybuilding or character development (maybe except for kang). Story is just meh. Just forgettable . 3D was also not that good. It just felt like a remake of the journey to the center of the earth with multiverse elements and star wars like atmospheric additions. Im not saying its a bad movie. Its okay. But it should have been Great ."
3," Worst MCU movie by a long shot
",MatthewMichaelHoffman,/user/ur152799620/,17 February 2023,"SDORE: 3.3/10I've never been so upset about having to write a movie review before. This one hurts. Marvel, what are we doing? This movie felt like one giant inside joke that I was not in on. I did somewhat enjoy the Star Wars type vibes, but it was a massive miss in all other areas. To me, it tried to take the humor from Love and Thunder and the epicness of Multiverse of Madness and shove them together, but I think by doing that they forgot who Ant-Man really is. Not including Luis and the gang is just a small example of how far they deviated from the story. I can tell that Kathryn Newton is a good Actor, but man were some of her scenes painful to watch. Everything up to Kang's introduction, with the exception of the first 5 minutes of the movie, was extremely dumb and mind-numbing stuff. The storyline of Janet withholding information from everyone and reuniting with the creatures in the Quantum Realm felt like being around that one awkward Aunt who makes everything about herself. I'll talk about it a bit later, but the dialogue and delivery from some of the characters was awful, which truly made it a pain to get through. Watching a movie like this gives you a new appreciation from something like Multiverse of Madness. I hate to say it, but this is the worst MCU movie by a long shot.This movie has 2 semi-redeeming qualities and that's it. I say semi-redeeming because the good comes with the bad. It was kinda of funny, and by kind of funny I mean MODOK was hilarious. The group of creatures that Scott and Cassie come in contact with in the Quantum Realm were funny and entertaining. The rest of the humor was pretty bad, and a lot of that had to do with the dialogue and the delivery from the actors. So much of it just felt awkward and borderline cringey. The other good thing, to no one's surprise, was Kang and Jonathan Majors. Kang is going to play a huge role moving forward, and they couldn't have picked a more talented Actor to handle that challenge. His dialogue was extremely powerful and the delivery was on point per usual. When Kang was at full power it was crazy to watch and the end credit scenes gave me things to look forward to but, again, there was a lot of bad with the good. The story was so messy and chaotic that I was too stunned to fully enjoy his parts because of how awful the rest of it was. Hopefully this is not a sign of what is to come for the rest of Phase 5."
5," So called next Thanos defeated by bunch of ants
",ramlmp,/user/ur102258154/,17 February 2023,I don't even want to waste time over this movie and to write her but i still will as to how much frustrated i am with mcu now that they made kang a joke defeated by some ants jus 5 min prior when he proclaimed he has killed avengers. The plot is boand had been done so many times the cringe jokes are again here and my god that horrible cgi of modok was pain to the eyes. The acting was terrible as well by the main casts and the movie is way too slow paced and felt like a set-up for the future which might be a setup again for another classic mcu. The final act literally felt like a Disney animated movie.
5," Just an average marvel movie.
",cimg_,/user/ur149641555/,17 February 2023,"Nothing special about this one. It had a lot of potential but it lacks to deliver. One avenger faces a force of nature like Kang with almost no consequences? That's a missed opportunity. Some good fight sequences and that's all. Also, loved the Star Wars vibe on the designs but little more.The other thing that bothers me is that the movie exists just because Janet doesn't talk about Kang (!). I mean, you literally know that the guy is dangerous and you don't say a word. Come on.My last observation: if one of the most celebrated things about a movie is a cameo or a post credit scene, it means that it has a lot of problems."
8," Better then people are letting on
",fumbles-38016,/user/ur79879697/,17 February 2023,"This movie was very entertaining and was well done. I don't know why they are giving it a low rating. I honestly thought that this one was a lot better then the second one and I was stick this movie right next to Guardians 2. I feel like the pace was good and the story was good too. Also kang was definitely stealing the scream for me, every time I saw kang I was scared, what a great way for a villain to be more introduced. They movie was very funny, I haven't laughed that hard at a marvel movie since Guardians 2. Everyone giving this movie a bad review just saddens me because they take marvel to seriously sometimes."
8," Not a bad start to phase 5
",bambookamer,/user/ur161919602/,17 February 2023,"Wow!! Ok so this was a pretty good entry into the MCU. I know the critics on RT hit it hard and I'm sure some fans will feel the same. But considering how Phase 4 landed I actually found this movie to be a breath of fresh air. It's very much like a Sci-fi movie and very different than many MCU movies but I didn't mind that at all. It does feel like a combination of other sci-fi films like Star Wars, again not a problem for me personally.It was a little goofy at times but that's the comedy you usually see in a Marvel Film. I enjoyed that it didn't push a lot of politics into it and Jonathan Majors was an awesome villain. There were some scenes not big scenes that they could of left out. A character or two didn't seem needed in my opinion but all major characters were very cool. To be honest it felt more like a Kang movie but that was awesome because I enjoy the villains.There are two end credit scenes both are cool, a lot of people made a big fuss about them but it wasn't anything I didn't expect to see. There is a lot going on in this movie but if you watched all the Marvel movies it's not that hard to keep up. We watched it in 3-D and that's the way to go in my opinion. On a scale on 1-10 I think a 7.5-8 is a fair score. But overall I really enjoyed the crap out of this film. And I know people are going to say I'm a Marvel fanboy but I still haven't watched Thor Love & Thunder a second time. This was easily the best Ant-Man film. This movie will get multiple watches from me."

9," New future began
",hbfs-26875,/user/ur162417640/,17 February 2023,"The story of the movie is relatively simple, but what sets it apart is its seamless and complete narrative. Kang's stays faithful to the comic book setting, though the balance of power among the characters may not be entirely even. Overall, it is an excellent popcorn movie that I would give a 9 out of 10, largely due to its outstanding cast. Although it may lack a bit in terms of humor, the storytelling is very rich and engaging. The film takes the audience on a thrilling adventure with a well-executed plot that keeps them invested until the very end. It also features some jaw-dropping action sequences that are visually stunning and guaranteed to leave the viewers on the edge of their seats."
8," A really good movie that gets straight to the point without any lag.
",anusreepmurali,/user/ur142704593/,17 February 2023,"The first half was really good. All the character introductions were great. The second half was chaotic but entertaining and gripping. Jonathan Majors delivers an amazing performance. The mid-credits and post-credits scenes were excellent especially the mid-credits, as a person who has read the comics I was really excited. The movie lacks its usual humorous tone, but this movie is supposed to be serious and it does that. There is no lag whatsoever and there is no unnecessary fillers. Also the post credits were unexpected. As a Marvel fan and movie goer, this was an enjoyable and a different experience from the rest of the MCU movies. The fact that this movie is only just a beginning of the multiverse saga is incredible. Overall, loved the movie."
2," Disappointing
",ladyliliroche,/user/ur81897723/,17 February 2023,"I already dont have much expectation coming into this movie. We bought a standard ticket (ie not imax or xtremescreen), day 1 in Australia. The cinema was pretty empty (though it is probably due to the time too. We catch the movie quiet early. Before dinner time basically.)There was only this 1 person that laugh at the jokes and kinda seem to enjoy the movie.This movie basically lower my IQ and kinda spit in the face of science.Lots of magical bubbly word of Quantum, subatomic etc being thrown around to sound smart as they were explaining it. The whole thing doesnt make sense.First of all, why is there a civilization in a quantum realm? Bacteria / amoeba is not a human like civilization. How are they even there? Kang do not even create them since Kang took their area... apparently.And if there is a civilization... why is Janet is alone? WHY IS SHE ALONE FOR 30 YEARS? And kept saying SHE WAS ALONE FOR 30 YEARS WHEN SHE BASICALLY HAS INTERACTION WITH BILL MURRAY (fine if she wanna keep her relationship secret with her husband but this is ruining her trauma and hardship in the first movie).The whole trope of ""I don't want to explain it"" and ""we dont have time to explain it"" gets tiring fast.And the script was lacking!! One of my iffy point is when Bill Murray;s character do not recognize the word human but use the word people!? Like hello?From the beginning, I was already confused on how people actually breath when they go to quantum realm, since oxygen molecule would be larger than their bodies, but anyway, I can live with that disbelief but a whole civilization? With a whole metal cities and electricity?I kinda think they went through some rewrite and forgot bits and pieces. There was a scene towards the end where Janet got captured by Kang and the next scene lead with Janet being escorted by the guards to face Kang who was sitting in his throne. Did Janet went to the toilet or something and that is why she had to be escorted back by the guards?And why is Chidi (the mind reading guy who is also from the good place - my fave show) is even there? AND WHY WAS HE ABLE TO READ A SENTIENT MIND? JUST WHY IS THERE A WHOLE CIVILIZATION THERE?There was a lot of star wars influence and looks for some reason. If only they basically went through another multiverse instead of saying this whole quantum realm where it was basically nonsense. Kang's palace could be inside some burnable rubbish for all we care.Paul rudd is paul rudd. A delight and I like watching him. I kinda want to watch clueless now. Cassie was alright. Funny that they recast her but I didn;t even know until I check the web for some info.There was a teaser for Loki too (the show that disappoint me fully). Tom looks good and young. Owen wilson is there too. Exciting... maybe... if only Marvel start hiring better writer and stop writing bad movies.Last note - since Kang couldnt recreate the Pym particles, it means Hank is smarter than him. Screw those advance technology. Multiverse travelling, emotions driving... cant even do Pymu;s particle. Should have studied other universe's scientist more.Hopefully Guardians would be a good and fun movie but I am sure done with expectation... was hoping the movie end fast. Two hours felt really long. There was some boring shot too during exposition. The headshot with actor right in the middle as they are explaining, just standing still... boring..."
10," FANTABULOUS!!!
",deepakmishradipu,/user/ur100598484/,17 February 2023,"The movie is mind-blowing, fantastic and has all the elements that fans need. Marvel is growing up with a very large scale. Every characters have their own presence. KANG the conqueror is the peak of the movie. Jonathan majors is so versatile. Don't trust critics review. The experience you will get is beyond any critics point of view. Finally the mid and post credit scenes are icing on the cake. Definitely a fest for audiences after a long long time. An insane build-up to the MCU phase 5. Avengers Kang denasty should be 10 times bigger than endgame. A kickoff start for phase 5 and way to go. Eagerly waiting what's next in the lineups."
7," Phase 5 begins, and Kang carries it all
",amiticiae,/user/ur160916908/,17 February 2023,"I have had the privilege and fortune to be able to watch it on opening day in 3D. I personally mostly enjoyed it, but I found some flaws with it.Let's get to the positives first. Majors was genuinely threatening and scary as Kang, his gravitas being genuinely scary and chilling for the entire multiverse. He has managed to be a legitimate contender to Thanos' throne as MCU's biggest villain yet. Another positive I can note is the humor. Now, I did not laugh out loud at every single joke that the film had to offer, but its heart was mostly genuine, and some of it did land. (MODOK's appearance was ironically pretty funny to me, the CGI monstrosity was... something.)Now let me get to the negatives. If it weren't for the fact I watched it in 3D, I think it would be obvious most of the time that they are on a green screen in a CGI world. The creatures in the Quantum Realm were mostly uninspired. It was clear they had taken references from other sources and... eh. It kinda looked busy.The plot follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) as he lives his life in San Francisco. It all starts off normally until his daughter, Cassie, gets freed from prison after she was in some sort of protest or whatever? Then they go to Hank's lab or something and they discover that they can communicate with the Quantum Realm. That machine goes wrong and they get transported into the Quantum Realm. They find their way in, learn a bunch of customs and, after drinking some slime, can communicate with whatever creatures there are in this realm.Then at some point, Ant-Man, Hope, Hank, Cassie and all the others get separated, things go on, Bill Murray appears and is freaking cool, at some point there comes Kang, some more things happen, then it really begins to end when Ant-Man, Hope and Cassie stand alongside Kang, and Kang says ""I conquer worlds, you talk with ants"" and Hank just comes with a CGI army of ants to save the day, and then they're in some tower and the little guy has to sacrifice, then it's kinda bittersweet.Fine plot, it works, it was entertaining, but honestly I liked what 3D could bring to me and my favorite part was when the screen went dark and he got into the nucleum and there was the Storm of Possibilities, pretty cool CGI. Entertaining, good as an introduction to Kang, but not much else. Could have been a lot better."
8," Phase Five Starts Out Big With a Small Character
",MJL_Uncensored,/user/ur16949152/,17 February 2023,"The third Ant-Man is ambitious, silly at times, and surprisingly eerie at others. This is Scott Lang's chance to finally shine on a grand without the Avengers and you know what...he does! By no means is this a perfect film but it's the first film where an Ant-man film feels like it has stakes for the broader MCU beyond a post credit scene like Ant-Man and the Wasp.Quantumania is a psychedelic journey through a miniature Star-Wars-eque universe that's inhabited by oddities ripped straight from a 10-year olds imagination. That's not a bad thing, but I suspect the rigid minds of adults will find it too trippy in some areas of the film (which I'll discuss near the end) but it's this creativity that gives the Quantum Realm its visually stunning appeal.The story itself is a simple one: Scott Lang and family are pulled into the Quantum realm and introduced to the newest big bad in the MCU...KANG!! Kang is trapped and needs Scott to help him to escape. Johnathan Majors as Kang is a beast of a man. His mood switches between vulnerable to vicious in the flick of a light switch and it is awesome to see. Kang is menacing, crafty and cunning but its Michelle Pfeiffer's range of emotions as Janet that sells Kang's villainy better than anything the film gives us. Janet Van Dyne is the embodiment of trauma in this film and Kang is the trauma she suppressed.I always have to remind myself that Ant-Man films are intended for kids so there's a reason for its tone and style. But there are times that I wish the film trusted itself enough to just lean into the world they created and allow it to engross us instead of occasionally relying on silliness that pulls us out of the moment. I long for the day when sci-fi films gives us a world that has a sort of evolutionary synergy like Avatar instead of feeling like a dump of toys from a child's toy box onto the screen. Ancillary characters should fill the world, not serve as a punchline. That's one of the weaknesses in this film.Overall, its a fun return to the MCU's ever expanding universe and sets up the future in exciting new ways."

",marbennett,/user/ur75902121/,17 February 2023,"Took the kids on opening night, ages 16, 10 and 9. We all thought it was terrible. 10 year old even fell asleep. Seen all the Marvel movies and this one takes the basement. I'm a fan of Paul Rudd and could tell even he was uncomfortable in some scenes. Kathryn Newton was standout awful. Jonathan Majors was the only bright spot and gets the three stars. Everyone else was forgettable. Storyline leaps into the Quantum realm at the beginning. Lots of colorful special effects but your left wondering, what is happening and why? Storyline try's to repair itself and fails miserably. 'I didn't tell you about....' Ugh, just skip it altogether."

",jamesvhamlin,/user/ur142455230/,17 February 2023,"First and foremost, that brother Kang is a man you don't want to mess with! This villain from start to finish has you on edge wondering if Ant-Man or any of his family were going to die. Kang the conqueror makes his mark on Phase 5 and without even holding a finger. His words and the way he can just command a room was scary and also fun to watch. Ant-Man and the Wasp both did their thing in this film. I felt like the CGI could have a been a little better but it did not fail my expectations. Marvel did their thing in this one, but also could've done better. We see a new dynasty beginning to form at the end of this film."
10," Critics are wrong more then the weather man
",darkman4801789,/user/ur42761378/,17 February 2023,After reading the critics reviews I wasn't expecting it to be great but man were they wrong. The movie kicks it into high gear fast and speeds up. Fresh ideas and environment for the 3rd installment in the Antman trilogy! The effects look amazing you can really be amazed with the 360 screen they shot in. I always enjoyed the humor in all three films but this one feels a little more adult then the other 2. All the actors in this movie did a great job but jonathon majors really sticks out as a great performance and breathes new life into what seemed like a dying franchise. Make sure to stay for the 2 post credit scenes.
6," Does not live up to the hype
",gariastn,/user/ur162415108/,17 February 2023,"Ant-man and the Wasp is a decent outing for Scott Lang and company. Its a fun movie but feels a little bloated even though at 124 mins it's not an especially long movie.Some of the humour feels forced and unoriginal. It tries to be goofy and a serious scifi adventure flick at the same time but struggles to get the balance right.However for hardcore MCU fans, it teases an intriguing new villain. Kang's backstory feels a little muddled but perhaps it will be fleshed out appropriately in future outings.Jonathan Majors is so compelling as a villain that he deserves a standalone feature.This new phase of the MCU focuses on the stories and characters of the quantum world and sets up Ant-Man as a central protagonist of this phase of the MCU."
4," WHy sO mUCh HatE YaLL??
",sahilhabib-66873,/user/ur83198102/,17 February 2023,"Why so much HATE?! Let me tell you (SPOILER WARNING):Action scenes were just too generic for an MCU film. You don't get to see anything new or extraordinary. Some action sequences were dark and the camera was shaking too much making it impossible to follow. Also, the humour is mid. One or two funny scenes and the rest is lame like thor: love and thunder.The movie is extremely predictable. If you've watched the trailer then you can probably predict 80%-90% of the movie.-Most of the dailogues are just exposition, rather than having actual dailogues that engage and create intrigue. Seriously, after a point it felt like a boring, cgi-driven quantum/kang documentary with action scenes as fillers.The film doesn't explore it's main characters any further from what we've seen before. Only character that gets explored really well is Kang The Conquerer (the film's only saving grace apart from Paul Rudd). Cassie's character has been expanded in this film but it's the same boring rebellious heroic child that you've seen a 100 times in other mcu phase 4 projects.Kathryn Newton who plays cassie, gives a straight-faced boring performance. Pretty much the same expressions in almost every scene. Hard to believe that she's scott's daughter.Looks like any kid in mcu now can make high tech devices like quantum realm hubble/portal, iron man suit and vibranium detector, etc.MODOK's face cgi was abysmal and cringy. They've litterally changed modok's entire character in this movie. He's Darren (yellowjacket) from the first movie. MODOK somehow gets inspired by Cassie's boring speech during climax battle and then switches his sides to Team Antman and goes on to fight Kang. It was so abrupt and made no sense whatsoever, considering the fact that Cassie's father was responsible for his current state in the first place.Hank Pym's character was boring. He doesn't say or do much in the entire film. He's supposed to be a genius who created pym particles and was such a fun, dynamic and interesting character in the previous antman movies. Can't believe that in this movie, he's reduced to just flying a plane and translating the ant army.Why does janet withhold such trivial information about kang, from hope and hank? What was the worst that could have happened if she told them about it? Also, with this information, Hank could have prevented cassie from ever making such a device that could link their world to the quantum realm in any way. Let alone a device that sucks them in.When cassie activates the quantum hubble at the beginning of the film, a blue ball of light appears from the device that sucks them in the quantum realm. Why doesn't it appear the second time cassie activates the device to bring in scott and hope. And how is the hubble creating portals now? I thought the portal through which Cassie, Hank & Janet escape the quantum realm was created with the help of kang's power core. So how come the same portal is opened the second time with CASSIE'S HUBBLE?? Makes no sense given the premise of the film.Lastly, this is just a personal gripe, WHERE THE HELL IS LUIS?! HOW CAN YOU MAKE AN ANTMAN MOVIE WITHOUT LUIS AND GANG?! I'd have rather had luis narrate Scott's autobiography. Would have been so funny! But then again, this is just a personal gripe.So basically, AMATW: Quantumania was a below average film for me. It did have some fun moments but eventually they didnt outweigh the film's flaws. The cgi of the quantum world was great but MODOK was butchered in this film. However, the film decently sets up the next high-threat villian and the future of Phase 5 with two incredible post credit scenes. Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors are the film's only saving grace."
7," Fun superhero movie - cool villain
",RussHog,/user/ur41031967/,17 February 2023,"I went into this with low expectations but ended up enjoying it. It's not a perfect film, but it doesn't suck. The story is that Ant Man and The Wasp enter a micro-world known as the Quantum Realm and encounter a trapped universe conquerer named Kang who wants to escape and unleash his wrath on all known reality. The world building is a lot of fun, the characters are pretty cool, and in the end the action is well done. The actor who plays Kang does a good job not to overplay the role and is a pretty solid villain. (Something the Marvel cinematic universe doesn't really have a lot of is good villains.) This movie has lots of action, some memorable lines, and it's never preachy. A fun superhero movie with a cool villain."
9," Phase Five Is Off With A Bang
",ben_cameron,/user/ur102063049/,17 February 2023,"A more traditional super-hero epic, wrapped up in gorgeous quantum sparks and heavy Star Wars vibes (Anyone else feel like we were in a galaxy far far away at times?! Cantina's and creatures galore. Loved it!).Visually wild with a striking score and a terrifying villain. Performances were spot on from all the cast, but Major's was absolutely magnificent.Whilst being absolutely bonkers inside the quantum realm, the story is a lot more straight forward than previous MCU entries.Killer introduction for Kang. Continued fun times for the Ant-Man series. Phase Five is officially kicked off with a bang!"
9," A different movie
",sivankumar-97122,/user/ur126887308/,17 February 2023,"A nice and enjoyable movie, Movie felt crisp and on point marvel has ita comback with this movie. Jonathan majors as kang is definitely nailed the role. Marvel never disappoints with the post credit scene. Can it fullfill the level of expectation that created by the endgame and infinity war definitely not, this movie is good on its own. If you are looking for a fun filled and action thrilled movie then this is the movie for you, hand to hand combats are done perfectly.Some more extended scene which shows scot and casey's love would be even more weighing to the story line. Little more of flat jokes too."
6," Fun to watch, if you turn off your brain
",OnlyAtJMart,/user/ur6069934/,17 February 2023,"I like Paul Rudd. I think he's naturally charming and really funny. I really wanted for this Ant-Man to do well, as the other 2 were just okay, and didn't do well in the box office either. Unfortunately this isn't the hit movie that changes things for Ant-Man or Marvel. It has some good moments, and cool visuals. However if you look a little deeper, a lot of things stand out. Like the fact that they were harvesting quantum energy from the quantum realm in the post credits of the last movie, yet Janet didn't seem concerned, even though she is very worried about the quantum realm, which they show in the trailer, so it's not something you'd only gather from watching the movie. Her backstory was kept quiet because they hadn't thought of it yet. Usually they keep things open for other Marvel movies, but this story felt very tacked on for the sake of this movie. Hope had some moments, but very little dialogue. Also, I thought I dozed off, as this movie seemed to jump from a long first act, to the third act. Jonathan Majors (Kang) does all the heavy lifting in this movie. His story, and his motivations seem the most developed. I wouldn't call this a bad movie, but they didn't knock it out of the park, by any means. It seems like Marvel has been in this post-Endgame slump that they haven't been able to break out of."

Bringing in the with bang Kang the next big baddie in MCU after Thanos, or did they??....For some reason even after a very bad 2nd movie I was excited to see this 3rd installment and see how the character of Kang would be portrayed in the movie, but after watching it while the performance of Jonathan majors was standout, I was left underwhelmed. Its just another Marvel movie with a lot of shortcomings in the storyline. The plot felt uninspired just like the previous one without bringing anything new to the table.The Movie in its core the movie lacks proper development even though the movie had some beautiful visual effects they only feel to serve as distraction from the weak plot. Its basically all just CG other than maybe the faces of some at times .If you are also someone who used to love Marvel and was hoping that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania would get the MCU back on track after several disappointing entries and you can safely avoid to go out of your way to watch this. 6 is for real generous for this."

",dhozu,/user/ur144378509/,17 February 2023,"Jonathan Majors performance as 'Kang The Conqueror' is praise worthy, he delivers it with great intensity. Kang chaos is kicked off for the 'Multiverse Saga', with this entry movie of MCU Phase 5. Entertainment is filled with humorous comedy and action that MCU delivers as always.

",mozeezchamp,/user/ur102163638/,17 February 2023,"At the dawn of MCU's Phase 5 this is a Excellent start and now the unexpected things are going to be turning up. In my Experience, this movie setup bigger plots for the future and I love Marvel Studios ways of story telling. This not about only Antman or Kang but it is the journey of Multi-Versal Saga.Loving and looking forward for all the bigger adventure Marvel Studios has planned. The most loving part in this movie was the Cenimatic Experience and the Quantum Realm just comes to life. It looked so real and the CGI was perfect in all part. Kang was the best in his character, love the way Jonathan Majors played Multi Player Roles expecially the way he delivers Kang is astonishing and outstanding badass villain ever played. I bet this is the most challenging role in whole Marvel Cenimatic Universe because of the diversity and different philosophy then most of the characters. All together I loved the movie, all the characters played justice to their roles but Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors are the show stealers. Wow want a experience. Love you Marvel and all who contributed, makes my experience a must watch and much appreciated in all times."
8," Setup for future MCU
",nickfolkesstudio,/user/ur65439369/,17 February 2023,"People will find anything to complain about, but the reality is you have to have the right expectations going in to any Marvel film: this movie does more setup for the future than anything, including Kang, Cassie, and the MCU at large.It's it Endgame or No way home? Nope. Is it still entertaining and have the signature Ant-Man humor? Of course. We get a decent and entertaining M. O. D. O. K., we see yet another teen hero setup, we get a broad look at the potential big bads out there, and we get Paul Rudd plus a quirky supporting cast. You shouldn't expect a whole lot more out of a setup movie like this.It's sad we don't see the ex-con gang, sure, but there's no way they could've been worked in. We do see Scott trying to adapt to changes in his life, and struggle as any great hero writing would have him do, and we do get to see a mostly average guy be a hero, or at least learn more ways in which to be one.Pacing is fast, and there are plenty of Easter eggs to find. The writing is humorous but still shows a continued development of the Ant-Man property. There is still room for growth, and no doubt we will see Scott again.If the movie hadn't deviated from the things that made the first one fun, people would've complained that it wasn't different enough. Some are already complaining it deviated too much. Just give it a shot and be ready to accept it as a new bit of universe building for the MCU. It's laying ground work. They gotta start somewhere for the next big arc."
6," Average at best
",grayinthedark,/user/ur109773849/,17 February 2023,"I may have enjoyed this a bit more than others mainly because my expectations were incredibly low. I was treating it just another average superhero comic movie and also Paul Rudd was great.Nothing innovative was really done to the story itself. It had the same cookie cutter plot, nothing we haven't seen before overall.On top of the bland story, the CGI for certain scenes were bad. I watched this in IMAX and some sequences would get blurry and just chalky or some scenes would have laughably ugly CGI for which Marvel
should be blamed because we have seen in the past that they are able to really create beautiful set pieces with a mix of CGI and practical effects(like End Game)Some of the characters in the film were also there to probably just create a subplot of some kind so there can be a bit of back and forth but it didn't really have any sort of major impact nor did it make me care about these side charactersIn the end this was very average at best, though it is suppose to setup Phase 5 for marvel, it definitely didn't feel like it."
8," Movie was Great ðŸ˜Š
",nsjmcbere,/user/ur121327342/,17 February 2023,"So many people don't seem to know the chaos that Jonathan Majors Character will cause in future Marvel movies, but I'm finally excited. To be honest after endgame some people seem to lose interest in Marvel movies because of the new characters but this movie was exciting because it will link and renew many of the characters at the end of the Phase. If you are a Marvel fan you will enjoy this movie just because of the new BAD. I think Jonathan Majors did great and I am very excited to see him in future Marvel Movies. Don't let bad reviews or on the fence reviews make you not see this movie. In my opinion it's a must watch if you would like to understand the direction of Marvel. The visual is awesome and as you know it's Ant Man Movie so there will be laughs, it's fun, but Majors really caught my eye."
1," Bad movie bit better than love and thunder
",joshilifestyle,/user/ur150874652/,17 February 2023,This movie is so bad. Nobody cares if some kida makoda die in the movie . You did not get any emotional feel or emotion for the movie. Seriously the mid credit scene tells you Marval is gone . They don't have story or villain. Avoid this movie . I don't trust Marval now . Wasted money on this and love and thunder as well. Seriously even I don't want to watch any Marval Movie form now on. Spider man no way home was the last great movie . Black panther 2 was also better but they forget how to make good movie now. Don't make movie for just to make it . Why wasting people'a time and money on this kind of movies.

Imo its best movie after Spiderman No Way Home
Man the VFX is simply awesome The plot Jonathan Majors what an actor he suits the role KANG so well and MODOK was also good
I would watch it again the cast was simply amazing And btw you should watch Loki before watching movie so heads up for the plotsThe movie had me on the edge of the seat for multiple times and the after cred scenes man i ruined my throat screaming for what I saw
If there was one word to describe this movie it would be KANGFUL

7," Ant-Man & the Wasp vs. Kang (NOT the talking brain from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)...
",Chalice_Of_Evil,/user/ur5464931/,17 February 2023,"Fittingly, the Ant-Man films have always been 'smaller scale' MCU films. Much like how Ant-Man himself can grow from small to GIGANTIC, what started out as a little heist film about a divorced ex-con named Scott Lang has now become something multiverse-threateningly HUGE. While some might miss the 'smaller stakes' of the original, this is just natural progression. I've always been fond of Scott, and he remains a likeable guy who *isn't* an a-hole/egotistical jerk (unlike certain other Avengers...who shall remain lifeless), but someone who cares about others, stands up for 'the little guy' and does what needs to be done for the greater good even if it means self-sacrifice. Although at the start of this film he's basking in the warm glowing warming glow of the fame that comes with being an Avenger, he remains NOT a jerk thanks to his family who bring him back down to Earth/keep him grounded. This includes his daughter, Cassie (whose life he missed out on 5 years of thanks to being stuck in the Quantum Realm), Hope van Dyne (who he's got a good relationship going on with) and her parents, Hank Pym & Janet van Dyne.When Cassie, who proves herself quite adept at SCIENCE like Hank, unintentionally causes a signal to contact someone from Janet's past in the Quantum Realm...the family of five gets sucked into it. The journey's as trippy as you'd expect, and if nothing else, the Quantum Realm allows for craziness UP THE WAZOO, as we're treated to all manner of weird and wonderful sights including truly bizarre flora and fauna, living buildings (that are suspiciously phallic-like in appearance) with tentacles, a past character we thought lost who's undergone some interesting changes...and Bill Murray (basically playing Bill Murray). Last time Janet was here, she unwittingly helped someone who turned out to be Kang the Conqueror. He was banished (which she didn't know until *after* she'd helped him) and almost got free, but she trapped both herself and him in there until she was freed in the second movie. Now she's back, he wants a gizmo that she made unusable (thanks to those helpful Pym Particles) put right again so he can use it to escape and destroy the multiverse or whatever...you know, the usual bad guy life goals.Scott finally gets some bonding time with his daughter, though probably not quite in the way he was hoping for. At one point he utters that instantly iconic line from the trailer: ""I don't have to win...we both just have to lose."" as he's getting beaten, and that's what I think makes Scott Lang/Ant-Man a true hero. Although he's fighting a battle he can't possibly win against an all-powerful enemy, he's willing to remain defiant/fight for the people he loves (as well as everyone else) until his last breath. Also, Paul Rudd's just so easily likeable as Scott. Meanwhile, Hope (Evangeline Lilly, sporting a new super-short 'do. It's more 'practical' for fighting...but I preferred her previous hair) remains Ant-Man's equal as the Wasp when it comes to mastering the shrinking/enlarging fighting-style. These two have been through a lot and it's nice to see them working together like a well-oiled machine. She and Ant-Man are true partners, helping/saving each other at various times, and Hope proves herself just as selfless as Scott towards the film's end.Cassie (previously played by Emma Fuhrmann, who I personally thought did a lot with a little during her all-too-brief appearance in Avengers: Endgame, managing to create a very *real* effectively emotional moment with Rudd during their reunion scene), has been recast with Kathryn Newton (who's come a long way since her recurring role on the TV series Supernatural among other things). This version of Cassie is clearly smart...except when she isn't, but that's not really her fault since she didn't have all the necessary information to prevent her mistake she makes at the start of the movie (when will MCU characters learn that keeping secrets is BAD?). In between father-daughter-bonding, with occasional typical moody teen behaviour and getting in on the action with a suit of her own (she can handle herself in a fight just like the others), Cassie at least *admits* to her mistakes/tries to make up for them. She's certainly not the worst of the 'younger' generation of characters we've met in the MCU thus far.As for the 'older' generation, Hank/Janet (along with Hope) catch up on the time they lost together as a family in amongst all the craziness going on. They each have a role to play/get to be awesome in their own ways (Hope's aforementioned kicking butt, Hank coming to the rescue at a pivotal moment and Janet handling herself admirably without the aid of a suit). Michelle Pfeiffer especially gets to shine, as we see the weight of what Janet's been carrying with her all this time and she goes toe-to-toe/holds her own against the film's villain (make no mistake, he *is* the VILLAIN. No sob story excuses killing trillions, which Janet rightly points out to him). I've seen much praise for Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang, and I'll admit that when I watched the first trailer for the movie, he did give off a quietly menacing vibe that was rather effective (better than those OTT villains who have to YELL all their lines). However, his taking-a-really-long-time-to-say-anything-and-get-to-the-point (he's like an Ent that way) got rather old/tiresome after a while and I think some have overpraised him a bit by claiming he's the 'best part' of the movie. He's a formidable foe...but still one I wanted to see Scott defeat.There's been conflicting opinions about this film, some praising it and others condemning it (yes, there's lots of CGI...but that's to be expected given they're in the QUANTUM REALM). While it does go overboard at times, that's par for the course. It's still a decent entry in the story of possibly the most underappreciated Avenger in the MCU and it definitely feels like there's more to tell."

",mg-231645,/user/ur112107413/,17 February 2023,"The film depicts the story of Scott Lang (Ant-Man) his family. I've never enjoyed this movie, some scenes are rushed and the plot itself is confusing.The villain of the movie Kang destroys his Quantumrealm and the scene wherein Scott Lang goes big was one of the only epic scenes in the film. But Kang was not a harmful looking threat like thanos.The VFX are bad and some parts are lacking.The ending was terrible, the moment where Kang will able to kill the team of avengers in his timeline was some kind of like nothing and he was only captured by an army of ants.Overall this movie is not good 4/10 and the first Ant-Man was still the best."

Jonathan Majors who a couple years ago was completely unheard of and is just suddenly in everything steals the show as Kang in this movie. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeffer and Evangeline Lily have strong performances as always. It's funny, has a good soundtrack and outstanding visuals. Definitely a solid 7/10, not a must see for anyone who doesn't follow these films religiously, but it will be a good watch for anyone who sees it.P.

A mix of film with some character straight out of Mad Max, Star Wars and Avatar all together in Quantumania ?My opinion is that this movie is watchable but far from a good Marvel movie. Dialogues at some point are really pooor.Luckily Kahng from Mayors is amazing but the rest of the movie is annoying, flash light everywhere...they just miss the Black Death, rebels are on point...Disney we need some blood! Why people is shoot just at legs and arms? Why nobody dies?

6," Phase 5 comin' in warm!
",nigeldimitrius,/user/ur149942686/,17 February 2023,"Ant-Man & The Wasp 3 dives deeper into the story of Scott Lang since the climatic events from Avengers 4. Or should I say that it focuses more on the backstory of Janet Van Dyne and her time within the Quantum Realm?...Yeah.. the second thing.Granted, this film shows promise to the rest of Phase 5 by providing us with a valuable first entry. The alien-esque CGI provides us with creative & daunting visuals, especially within our action-packed scenes. However, one of, if not the biggest, takeaway from this movie is Jonathan Majors as He Who Shall Not Be Named. He provides us with sheer talent, unsettling moments, and thought-provoking ideals that keep you at the edge of your seat.The story itself is funny, but lacks high stakes. The way this movie was marketed felt like there was more to lose. However, we're given the same MCU formula that you could point out in another MCU movie. I found myself wanting Majors' character to stay on screen because it felt like he was controlling what I saw next.There isn't much of a clear arc for our returning characters. It feels like we lose sight of where our character's growth starts and ends, leaving their story a bit unclear. The actors do an okay job working against this, but without the high stakes, it almost seems pointless.Overall, Ant-Man & The Wasp 3 is still a decent film and a worthy start to Phase 5. However, with everything we've seen since Phase 4 and even Phase 3, Marvel should consider turning up the heat."
8," Don't Listen To The Critics
",gretchiekc-62170,/user/ur162408047/,17 February 2023,"As someone who absolutely despised almost everything in Phase 4 (ESPECIALLY THOR LOVE AND THUNDER - Seriously, how did Thor become such an idiotic clown?) I had low expectations for this. I loved Jonathon Majors portrayal of Kang in Loki...and Paul Rudd is Paul Rudd, so I was holding out hope I wouldn't be begging to leave the theatre 20 minutes into the movie like I did with TL&T.And I didn't.I didn't want this movie to end...and I honestly don't think I've felt this way about a Marvel movie since Endgame. Is it as action packed as some of the other films? No. But it's a solid film that takes Ant-Man from a silly, slapstick character to a silly, slapstick HERO....even if he might have inadvertently unleashed a whole horde of Kang's on the world.And that's the genius of Jonathon Major's Kang - you find yourself, at times, rooting for him. In a slight spoiler - Kang was banished to the quantum realm by his variants...and this Kang tells Scott he's the ONLY one to prevent what's coming...and what's coming? ""Me"" he tells him. So I kept wondering throughout - is THIS the version of Kang that goes to war with the others and establishes the sacred timeline? Is that why he was banished? Or...is that Kang among the others? IN any case, we know ""He Who Remains""...probably wasn't all that benevolent given that he was the one who conquered all the others....but even when you know he's the villain, Majors just has a way of making you care about this character in a way I never thought possible for a villain in a superhero movie.While I was not surprised by the appearance of MODOK...that reveal was the best surprise and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED LOVED LOVED that character.Finally, the end credit scenes were perfection.I don't know why the critics panned this film - I thought. It was far more enjoyable than the second Ant Man...and that's all thanks to the brilliance of Jonathon Majors and ""not a dick"" MODOK."
4," ""It's All About Bucks, Kid. The Rest is Conversation.""
",mattstone137,/user/ur40057749/,17 February 2023,"Another season, another entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the thirty-first entry into the franchise and, like at least the last twelve before it, does nothing to renew or revitalize the cinematic behemoth's trite formula. Peyton Reed is back in the director's chair, enthusiastically kowtowing to the demands of producers and ensuring there is no detectable sense of style or personal touch.Quantumania plays like a cross between tediously scripted Saturday morning cartoon and embarrassingly generic Star Wars rip-off, evoking no sense of fun or wonder despite creative makeup, costuming, and digital landscapes. It's utterly disposable and completely forgettable, but the theater was full at 3:00 pm on a Thursday, so silver lining, it will line some cultural overlords' pockets with cash.The film follows Scott Lang and company as they're sucked into the quantum realm, a land of mind-bending vistas and infinite possibilities. As Lang discovers the secrets of the realm and tries to protect his daughter Cassie, a new threat rises. Kang the Conqueror, one of Marvel's most powerful villains, takes advantage of the newly available Pym Particles, enacting a savage plan to nebulously do something or another. The film also introduces M. O. D. O. K, immediately butchering his characterization and badassery.The MCU runs the gamut from inspired to miserably inept. Quantumania proudly slots into the center of the spectrum, not nearly as imaginative or well-crafted as Iron Man or Infinity War, but not as boring or portentous as Thor: The Dark World or Eternals. It squeezes so snugly into its predestined mediocrity that it's difficult to scrape up thoughts which haven't been said of any other MCU film from the last two years.The tone is still scatterbrained due to incessant quipping, the filmic craft is still laughably corporatized, the CGI is still creative and complex though horrendously fake-looking, the villain is still stripped of all complexity or intrigue, and the heroes are still indestructible paragons of status quo ubiquity.Specifically, Quantumania's story unfolds sluggishly before kicking into hyper-speed. There's hardly time for character introductions, let alone character growth. A few minutes' stretch sets up a story of trust, subversion, and calculation, but is quickly bolled over for an overplayed, gratingly uninspired rebellion angle. By the time our characters are situated in this strange new world, the final act has started, and quickly becomes a typically rote slog.None of the performances elevate the film, though Paul Rudd is eminently likeable and Michael Douglas plays up to the stupidity of the material, charismatically smartassing his way through the adventure. Kathryn Newton is charming enough, Michelle Pfeiffer lends legitimacy to the inanity, and Evangeline Lilly...doesn't really have much to do, honestly.Jonathan Majors is the disappointment of the cast, always just teetering on the verge of sobbing no matter the scene or context. Kang is an all-powerful force of destruction, but Majors plays him like he never left the set for The Last Black Man in San Francisco. He's a great actor, but not an intimidator - he may have added thirty extra pounds of muscle to transform into a daunting presence in Creed III, but he didn't here; all he has here is a cool-looking cloak.What else is there to extrapolate after thirty previous entries? For perspective, the Bond franchise has been running for sixty years and just recently celebrated the twenty-fifth entry into its franchise, and where Bond has reasonably shifted its values, identity, and presence throughout several decades, the MCU continuously doubles down on its commitment to assembly line productions.The true shame is that, despite the staggering volume of the genre over the last twenty years, its context and potential for alteration (fundamental or superficial) has hardly been mined. Imagine a three-hour sweeping superhero epic, a dusty superhero western, or a psychological horror of superpowered insanity, all of varying budgets, tones, moods, styles, and complexity.Take the thought further - hire legendary filmmakers like David Lynch, Paul Thomas Anderson, Darron Aronofsky, the Coen Brothers, David Fincher, or (your favorite filmmaker). Sure, not everyone would go for the idea, but those who do would surely produce something of staggering ingenuity and creativity; the inexhaustible subtext of a superpowered world could be explored for decades, and these production companies have limitless resources to explore it.All a pipedream. Rather than force their audiences to grow up, Marvel and DC eagerly cater to their infantilized, developmentally arrested fanbases, slapping together content like Chinese day laborers, desperate to keep the dopamine perpetually dripping. Guardians of the Galaxy 3 will be here soon, The Marvels soon after that.Writing this review was tedious enough; I cower to think of recording thoughts for MCU film number thirty-eight, number thirty-nine, forty, forty-one, onward and onward for eternity, until the Canadians invade, the dollar collapses, or The Living Tribunal is caught in a human trafficking scheme. Either way, blessed release."
6," A mixed bag
",cardsrock,/user/ur24373984/,17 February 2023,"After most entries in Phase 4 passed by without doing much to set up the next big bad in the MCU, I was eagerly anticipating this film given it would be the big screen introduction of Kang. While Majors shines as Kang, the rest of the film and even some of the narrative choices with Kang leave a bit of a ""meh"" feeling.As far as positives, Paul Rudd remains as endearing as ever. MODOK is a tad jarring, but I liked the tie-in to Yellowjacket. The visuals are solid and it's a very colorful movie. Majors truly has a magnetic presence on screen and I found his dialogues and conversations to be very compelling.For negatives, there aren't really any arcs for the characters and Ant-Man himself ends up in literally the same place (on the sidewalk thinking about how good his life is) as the beginning of the film. Scott's cohorts aren't given much to do either. The MCU hallmark of jokes undercutting serious moments unfortunately continues and honestly the comedy really didn't land as well as the first two films. I also got major Rise of Skywalker vibes with the cliche ""everyone in the rebellion shows up to fight the space troopers at the end.""However, my big issue with the film is the ending. This movie felt like it should've had some major consequences to establish Kang as an Avengers-level threat. Having Scott and Hope dispatch him while a portal opens up to save them literally seconds after you thought they might get trapped in the Quantum Realm or Kang would escape was eyeroll-inducing. The Council of Kangs scene was also almost more goofy than menacing.I'm hopeful that Feige can right the ship and get the Multiverse Saga to Infinity Saga levels of hype, but right now I'm just left not feeling much. I never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm currently looking forward more to seeing how The Flash movie resets the DCU than how the MCU multiverse plays out."

Kang talks about killing the avengers in different universes/timelines, but can't beat Ant-man...The good:.FunnyFun actionGreat job with main charactersPowerful VillainHank the tank PymBad:It's all over the placeFelt rushedThe ending for the villainCringy dialogueCassidyA movie like this would normally be around a 5/10
But for whatever reason this movie works just enough for me... 6.2/10."
7," Jonathan Majors steels the show with his acting as Kang the Conqueror and his variants
",mahantamguru,/user/ur147277672/,17 February 2023,"The movie was Amazing and was a action pack cgi combo. The plot was predictable, yet still an amazing end credit scene filled the viewer with joy.Spoiler_ahead The movie was as predicted a plot where Kang forces Ant-Man to bring him something (Multiversal Energy Core) for his travels through the Multiverse.The death of M. O. D. O. K. Was called in as a joke who was a villain level character. They said that he dies as an Avenger. Which kind of spoiled the hope of getting something awesome at the end of the Movie.Theory: At the last Kang was shrinked in the Multiversal Energy Core, but as he said that he will erase all of his variants from the multiverse, I think after this he becomes the ""He who knows"".This can be only confirmed when the movie will be announced about its position in the MCU Timeline."

",gavintierney-81067,/user/ur162407079/,17 February 2023,"I don't think I have ever walked out of a Marvel movie so disappointed. More than Eternals, Captain Marvel, Love & Thunder you name it. I'll start with what I like as it will be quicker to type.Pros:
-Johnathon Majors Kang was greatCons:
-The writing was awful. It felt like the only character that got any effort put into them was Kang.-The woman in this movie got the short end of the stick as they do in most Marvel movies. Their scripts were particularly bad and Hope, you know the character who's name is also in the title, was such a non-character. And damn near everything Cassie said was cringey as hell and everything Janet said was so vague that it became annoying. I believe writing to be the primary reason for these characters lacklusterness.-There was too much going on and it didn't spend nearly enough time with any of it for me to get fully into it. There's the resistance, Kangs army, the mission, whatever Janet, Hank, and Hope were doing, and a ton of characters introduced which didn't get much introduction.-There was maybe 30 minutes of this movie that had me thinking I could get back into it. From when Kang first walks in, to when Antman is grabbing the orb with all his lookalikes. Then it got back to being a poorly written mess.-There are no stakes. Spiderman, Iron Man, Thor, Shang Chi, etc etc all felt like there was something on the line but this felt like there were no consequences to anything. Which leads me to the last point I'll make.-Johnathon Major's Kang was great, but I never felt like he was an actual threat. I felt Modok undermined the seriousness of his character, he didn't really flex his powers, and having watched it I felt that a majority of the original six avengers could take him in a 1-on-1. I understand he is just a variant and likely not the baddest most dangerous Kang. But the other Kangs banished him, it showed clips of him destroying timelines and planets so I would think that Antman wouldn't be able to basically solo him. Or felt like Hawkeye could take him with exploding arrows.Huge disappointment and this is the first time I have actually felt like all the hate is 100% warranted. If this is the direction of Marvel movies through phases 5-6 then I think they will lose a lot of fans. I'm sick of these movies primary purpose being to set up future projects while making the one they are currently on mediocre."
8," Big, Small, Antman's Got A Little of It All And Sometimes Too much
",rgkarim,/user/ur25226117/,17 February 2023,"LIKES:The Graphics/World Design
-Marvel really has a great budget to create worlds from our imagination and this installment continues to make it happen.-Lavish colors, odd beasts, a world that Strange World was trying to make but with more thought and layering.-Great cultures, a comic book sense of atmosphere, and a new world to which lots of foundations may just build from in the future.-Feels like a strong mash up of Star Wars, Marvel, and Battlestar with pinches of other movies to help spice up a few things with them as well. Nice references indeed.The Comedy At Times
-The comedy is awesome often thanks to writing and Paul Rudd making the lines come to life.-The snarky humor and sarcasm works very well, and I truly did laugh a bunch at how he just owns AntMan and makes it work on levels to be fun.-There are plenty of aggressive lines that will be there for people to enjoy, several filled with cursing so caution, but it works when in balance and timed just right.-And some running gags add a little spice to the mix as well, and that was awesome to say the least.-Overall, the comedy works for me, but there are limitations to be mentioned at a later section.The Action At Times
-The action does have these moments that show Marvel can still make a good fight.-Choreography has some flavor, the powers are fun, and the use of that awesome design comes out pretty well.-Several moments have some impressive strategy behind it, and again surprises me with how some of these stunt people can move.-And there is musical and visual support to help make everything come to life and have that movie magic that we love in these films.-Throw in some emotional moments that work to add that bite and edge, and several comedic moments, and AntMan 3 really helps add a little more sauce to the factor that many come to these movies for.The Character Development At Times
-Kang is the lead for me on this film, in just how much they took the one moment we had with him before and amplifies it so well. He gets a lot of time to flourish and I totally agree that he is worth it.-As for Scott, again he and Janet get some surprising levels that I love and these moments really help amplify those who seem somewhat forgettable, a joke of the movie, and really bring them to the forefront to be the heroes we want.The Acting
-Marvel is not often loaded with duds, so I can't say that I was surprised to see a strong hand played for this film.-I'd say just about everyone hits their mark, but I have limited room, so I'll stick to the three top listed and go from there.-Rudd is hilarious, hands down a solid balance of comedy, emotion, and bravado that establishes the themes of this movie and often does not stray into overacting. So natural in his delivery he keeps entertainment and drama in check.-Lilly was fine in her time on the screen, but I can't say that Hope had the same punches or influence on me as the past. She seemed a little laid back, lackluster, and then finally picks it up but not to the degree I've seen her in other films.-Majors though, wow, Majors kills this role. The man knows how to articulate movements, add elements to his speech and craft this role so well. Kang is such a layered villain and Majors destroys it with the way he incorporates so much into one man. What a fantastic ability to do so much.DISLIKES:The Pace Is A Fast
-Normally this is a good thing, and by the end you'll see why it might be a bit bad.-Quantumania really has a lot of things launching from it, and not everything was fleshed out, thought through, or detailed as Phase 1 and 2 were able to do for the most part.-It was great to see so much, and yet, it moved a tad too fast for me to really get everything down and have that commitment.-Perhaps they tried to launch too much and had they toned back, several parts of this could have had a consistently strong bite that these climactic moments had.-Though my bladder was happy, I think this one needed to slow down a bit in my opinion.The Character Development Is Bland At Times
-With that pace, some development felt a bit simplified and lacking.-Hope gets little for me in terms of truly worthwhile investment, and Hank is more comedic than truly amazing, lost to a secondary character status.-Several other new members are there to have an inconsistent bite, and though there are shining moments, there are sadly not the same speed that I like in my character stories.-Thus, these blander moments aren't the worst, but given the magic of Avengers and Civil War, I guess I expected more in this tale.Many Elements Feel Simplified:
-Again, there is a lot of potential in this movie, and yet... did it fully achieve it?-Some levels, yes, there are these champion aspects I wish I got more time with and had smoother transitions.-And yet other things just felt so watered down. Several cultural tribes and relationships. New characters who had abilities to dig out things, but were comedic only, and even several elements of exploration were lost.-All this build up at times sometimes just flops out and again, we are left with a bare bone, C-grade means to tell the tale.The Comedy Forced Sometimes
-There is plenty of good laughs to be had and I admit again I chuckled a bunch, especially some of the adult jokes.-But... again we have been robbed of balance and sometimes the comedy tried too hard to be funny for me and tripped up the momentum to be had.-A running gag about how to punch sometimes flopped for me, other times it was just stopping to joke during an action scene, and other times was just a joke going too far for me that it lost its edge for me.-I'm not saying it reached levels of Thor, but... I can also say sometimes the edge needed to win and stay while the jokes were left behind.The Action Could Have Been More
-Again, there are moments where the action is on fire and some of the best I've seen in a while.-But that doesn't mean it approaches the level that other films have done and given the buildup, I guess I feel more of it than other films.-Many action sequences last less than 5 minutes, with a tad simplification and a minimization to the chaos they could have had.-A few bad guys to beat down or at least scare off? Maybe a run in with Kang earlier and fleeing from him to an extent far less trivial.-And they still have not gotten big battles with lots of pieces the due time and natural development I know they can do.-Thus, the action could have been more in my opinion.The VERDICT
The opening hand for Phase 5 is heavy and truly a visionary wonder to behold. AntMan's third trip to the screens is loaded with a bunch of things you might like in regards to your movie with action, comedy, edge, emotion, and stakes that have been absent in a lot of Marvel's productions. It really has a lot of good in my opinion and has done the job of set up and entertainment to the point that there is a lot to uncover. Some good character use, a dab of emotion, and some focus on evolving characters is a nice foundation, and the comedic antics with the comic capers of fighting further help add the spice to things that I like in a movie. Not to mention, Majors really is a welcome addition for me and what he has done with a villain in terms of exciting layers. And yet, the movie still has balance issues, primarily in the form of doing a consistent job of handling everything and not doing too much. I think there was a lot they try to accomplish, which they kind of did, but I just think more time or less content would have helped with character usage, action, and that full effect I like to see in other movies. Still, I don't think this is horrible, nor do I think it is perfect, but the opening gamble was enjoyable for me. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0."
5," Jonathan Majors scored all the points
",rafamiko,/user/ur104896002/,17 February 2023,"That's it. The movie started when Kang appeared, he's a really charismatic, determined and terrifying character, and Majors plays him perfectly, after all he's a fantastic actor. The rest of the movie, the writing, the fight scenes, the so-called climatic moments, went from bland to straight bad. THE CHARACTERS, my god. Except from Kang of course, the rest of them were apalling, horribly written and let's not even start with developed, from Scott to Modok, not even a single one of them was funny, relatable, realistic, they didn't feel like real humans with emotions.And don't get me wrong, I am a Marvel fan, not a hater, I went to watch this movie on the premiere day because I was really hyped, so picture my disappointment. Don't bother with this, really hope the GOTG third movie is at least decent."
8," Jonathan Majors Conquerors
",essessr,/user/ur161199322/,17 February 2023,"Jonathan Majors (Kang) was the best highlight of movie, he overshadows everything when he is on screen. We can see the potential. As an AntMan movie this is good and starts the Phase 5 in a good way. Story wasn't really impressive except Janet and Kang's relation. In first half story was running in slow pace but that was good but the second half should have been like that, but it runs faster than the first half. Camera work is not as good as the previous two movies but it has some serious stuff in it. Overall I loved the movie and is enjoyable and I can say that Marvel is really back in the game."
8," An Awesome Film and one of the Best 3rd movies of Marsdvel Hero
",chasemmarshall,/user/ur97607996/,17 February 2023,"Ant-Man and Wasp: Quantimania is easily one Marvel's Top 7 films. While switching between humor and seriousness, it managed to never get boring and had me chuckling at random interactions the whole way through. It feels like a mix between the first Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor Ragnarok in both humor and a diversity(in personalities and groups) with a strong Star Wars influence.Do all of the characters get their time to shine? No, but I'm sure we will see many of them again which is good enough for me. The world is great, the characters are great, and the villain is a mysterious and interesting as Thanos. Luckily I'm sure we'll see his other personas before the character is completely removed from the cinematic time line. Honestly it could almost be a stand alone Sci Fi if it wanted to be."
8," Don't believe the HATE
",phillip-west-97042,/user/ur120938452/,17 February 2023,"This movie was really fun! I don't understand why it was picked apart by critics, but then again they lived Banshees of Ishirin and that movie was horrible and nothing!Not the best dialogue and it had cheesy moments, but fun story, and KANG was phenomenal! The action was good and the actors did their part, but lest be honest, this movie was made to introduce Kang and it did that very well.Some of the side characters were really cool and funny, but not super memorable. The world at times even had a Star Wars feel to it, and I thought that was cool.I recommend you go see it on the big screen and don't let the critics (who often are out of touch) sway you from a good time!"
7," The Marvel Studios conveyor belt of quantity over quality continues
",poseyfan,/user/ur83316413/,17 February 2023,"Well, I'll start off by saying that this wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't great, but it was alright. It was like Dune and Star Wars had a baby, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing.Jonathan Majors definitely stole the show here. We will be seeing a lot more of him. Literally.The CGI was very rough in places, and the editing was very off at times. It could have used an extra few months in development. At that, Modok was atrocious in execution.That's just how Marvel has been lately. Quantity over quality, unfortunately.Another thing I will say: I wish a Marvel movie would take itself seriously once in a while. The humor gets repetitive.7/10 for me."
5," Fun-ish, But Not Good
",austinbouma,/user/ur131144321/,17 February 2023,"Story was sort of fun. The visual effects were cool. The acting was solid for the most part (except for the mom who never should have been cast to play a mysterious serious character).Ant Man didn't even feel like a main character. Everything he did. He came up short and the women bailed him out.The writing was lazy. No clue how Cassie went from not being able to punch, to putting people in arm bars and flipping them. The ants mysteriously going into some separate portal and becoming really advanced seemed like a real convenient coincidence, which was the way they killed kang. Like where did that even come from. Not apart of the story at all. And there were lots of ""oh I didn't see that one coming"" momentsThe story line feels super cliche because not serious or intense. Big battle scenes don't work when things aren't intense. And also when the movie development just isn't there."
10," Epic and Exciting movie!!
",kajay-15019,/user/ur154064030/,17 February 2023,"This movie was full of comedy which is usually seen in Antman movies. But this was full of action and the way they introduced Kang the Conqueror was my favourite part..
The kicking of phase 5 was epic as expected and Marvel has learned a lot from his phase 4 mistakes..
The vfx, cgi, action, direction everything was perfect from the inside out..
This is a good signal for phase 5 and marvel also. This movie is gonna change the MCU forever. Kang the conqueror was comic accurate and badass
Marvel is gonna gain it's charm as it was in Phase 3 or even more than that.Hope this movie will be liked by everyone..."
6," Decent, but could have been great.
",benjaminskylerhill,/user/ur117768316/,17 February 2023,"Given the sheer gargantuan amount of character backstory and world-building that is stuffed into this latest entry in this decrepit franchise, it's really a miracle that it manages to work as well as it does. It doesn't work great, but it's far from a total failure.Firstly, highest praises must be given to the costumers, production designers, and visual effects artists. They came together and crafted a world in the Quantum Realm that is one of the most visually fascinating and thoroughly detailed I have ever seen put to film.And given that probably 85% of what's ever on-screen in this film was not really physically present, it's miraculous how convincing the world they created really looks, sounds, and feels.As an added praise to these artists, they really picked up the slack where director Payton Reed left it. The way he helms the in-camera scenes-particularly the action-heavy ones-is frustratingly dull, without a single shot feeling like it's anything more than functional.But the sweeping, huge wide shots of action that are entirely CG were largely breathtaking, framing the chaos in gorgeous clarity. I never thought I'd find the Quantum Realm to be such an intriguing setting, but they pulled it off.As for the narrative, there are definitely a couple of rushed character moments that could've used more emotional development, but the relationship between Scott and his daughter Cassie really does give this movie its heart.Their scenes together worked really well as I could feel them yearning for time they had lost and for an understanding they could have built. It largely made up for the sadly underdeveloped and criminally under-utilised villain Kang.Even though he explains his plans and motivations in great, long-winded detail, I still never felt like I understood him. It's all kept incredibly vague, and it made the story's huge stakes hard to care about.As the film neared its end, I was really happy with where it was going. It seemed like they were going for a tragic conclusion to a trilogy that would hit like a gut-punch given the story's parent-child themes.But then the ending really came, and I was disappointed. The film had built up a lot of momentum and was going somewhere really somber and profound, but they were too cowardly to stick the landing.The ending plays it very safe, clumsily wrapping everything up so we don't get too serious with it all.This is a film that I largely enjoyed for its artistic distinction from other MCU films. It could have been great, but it needed tighter focus and it needed commitment to the weighty ideas that it played with."
7," Pretty good flick but it is missing the magic of other Marvel movies
",subxerogravity,/user/ur59627333/,17 February 2023,"I thought it was good, but it was a little on the fluffy side. It has the same vibe as Thor Love & Thunder, I mean literally the same vibe, because Love & Thunder was trying to be as good as Thor RagnarÃ¶k, but lighting did not strike twice and this movie gave me the same vibe of trying to be better than Thor RagnarÃ¶k.Visually amazing, I loved how they took Ant-Man to another world, or universe is more like it. Similar to Guardians of the Galaxy it looks like their trying to exploit that Marvel in Space works. Loved Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. His funny quips about being an Avenger, fighting alongside Captain America and being mistaken for the other hero named after an insect was satisfying enough for me as a marvel head to keep the continuity going.Ant-Man seemed to be a film about family and I loved that. Plus, a lot of stuff for Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfefer to do, which was perfect sense they play the original Ant-Man & Wasp. Oh and my boy Jonathan Majors as Kang, that's a decent villain.I do feel that it missed the mark. It was fun to watch but I don't see myself repeating this fun watch like I did Captain America: Civil War or the first Ant-Man."
10," Character intro for Kang
",TheMercurial,/user/ur69946631/,17 February 2023,"I agree with all the negatives here, not an ant man brand movie, heavy on cgi, thin story. Doesn't matter. It's a spectacular first appearance for Kang. Huge presence, absolutely terrifying, sets the MCU tone for the next few years.Much better than dr strange, better than Loki as a Kang intro because of the brutal battle scenes. Really glad I saw it in the theater.People are complimenting the Cassie actress, and yes she was fine, but primarily her presence is youth, which contrasts starkly with Pym and wife. Even Ant man looks like an old man compared to her. Seemed to be setting the stage for her to be Ant man next with her battle chops and scientific training."
10," Back to OG Marvel
",pyhckd,/user/ur157273994/,17 February 2023,"Saw the premiere tonight and I felt like it was the early 2000s and the old Marvel again. Great plot getting ready to tie into MUCH bigger storyline, along with good humor. Not corny overdone humor (like the last Thor). The theater was packed an everyone around us agreed 10/10. Anyone saying this is a small plot, it's SUPPOSED to be, and I would question your dedication to the almost 20 years of Marvel movies. You have to live and adore them to understand how important this movie was to the next phase. I'm excited to see all the new storylines and build up to the next Avenger like movie. Disney/Marvel has done it again!"
5," Equally stuff that's good and stuff that's bad
",movies_are_life_,/user/ur160611631/,17 February 2023,"So much of what happens in this movie can be liked or disliked. Do you like the cgi because it's interesting to look at or dislike it because it's technically average cgi. Can you make sense out of all the plot holes and contrivances? Did you like both halves of the movie or prefer one? Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania has odds stacked against it because the way it is designed to go for the extremes of the type of experience it wants you to have.The extremes in question is technical aspects of the filmmaking (cgi, fight scenes, script) but also the tone. The ideas feel much larger than the movie lends itself to be. The fight scenes go from can go from well shot to disorientating. Script is seemingly full of plot holes, but also feels as if fans could have answers to everything. The movie seems to casually move about without trying to answer many questions I had regarding plot holes/contrivances. It wants you to just accept how it gets from point A to Z.I enjoyed the cgi. It wasn't ""great"" cgi, but I liked the way it looked for the world that it's set in. I also had some laughs, enjoyed many of the action scenes, and enjoyed Bill Murray a lot. Unfortunately, most everything I liked was in the first half of the movie. After the introduction of the villain, I slowly lost interest. 100 minutes in, the movie felt like it outstayed it's welcome. What happened was Ant Man decided to go larger and thus failed to feel darker. I much preferred the more simple story that was being set up before the real story came in to play."
2," STOP HIRING RICK AND MORTY WRITERS
",donpelz,/user/ur90460861/,17 February 2023,"I think marvel lost its track when they introduced the multiverse.....to many possibilities and characters could be a good thing or a bad thing which this very much was.The writing is just atrocious, the actor who played Cassie, was absolutely terrible; I actually think she almost single handedly stunted the growth of what could have been amazing, the other was the actor who played Jentorra, she was simply over-acting; exaggerated expressions and reactions took quite a bit from the realism of things..Again- the writing, it was an absolute disgrace ; think of the stereotypical Disney shows dialogue... it's much worse. The only good dialogues were shown in trailers.I think Kevin Feige needs to reshuffle the whole cabinet involved in this movie.I can't emphasize how bad this was.INTRODUCTION OF THE MULTIVERSE (after endgame)-
no way home was pretty decent but also fed on people's nostalgiamultiverse of madness- terriblelove and thunder - terribleWakanda forever- decent (mostly cos the multiverse wasn't involved)but this takes the cake in all the worse way possible, and I grew up watching Marvel."
7," Phase 5 kick off with KANG !
",adriano-40012,/user/ur69368647/,17 February 2023,"The third movie was totally different than the previous movies. It is definitely more brutal and serious, but still had its moments when I felt familiar with the movie. With that said there were scenes were I was like ' I've seen that somewhere else'. Known cliches and jokes are included. I find them funny. The CGI for the fights and specially for the scenes where Scott multiplies himself multiple times were cool. I'm really not a fan ob having basically too much CGI in a movie, but this movie needs that and I'm convinced, that had they had more budget they'd have done even more into CGI. Although I enjoyed the movie it should've been different cause some scenes felt like they were shorten to fit the screen time which is understandable. The issue is there were too many characters into the plot. I get the message it's more of a family adventurous movie. Hank+Janet+Hope+Scott+Cassie, but just for me Hope felt unnecessary for the plot. Janet was necessary because she already was there and has a secret to tell. I wouldn't rate this movie low or very high. It's a 7/10 for me and a decent introduction for Phase 5.Paul Rudd's performance is convincing, vividly and charming. I don't remember one movie I didn't enjoy with him. He's Ant-Man. His performance was hilarious and mushy in deep moments.Two days ago I've went to the local cinema to finally witness Kang The Conquerer in action. Jonathan Majors was brilliant he embodies the character in such an unique way. He can play it off real quick from a soft and sad character into an terrifying dangerous threat. That's some amazing act and needs to be called. I was surprised about the dynamic between Janet & Kang. We get to see a throwback segment and find out more about Kang and Janet's time when she vanished into the quantum level."
4," Not good.
",deeformecreep,/user/ur127572210/,17 February 2023,"This is the beginning to Marvel's phase 4 and it's a weak start.Let's start with the plot, it's weak and is literally caused by the main characters being dumb.The Cg looks terrible in most of the movie but can't really blame em since Marvel don't give the Vfx companies any time anymore.The only saving grace of this movie is Kang, Jonathan Majors sells every scene and is carrying this movie on his back.In the end this movie is no more than setup for something bigger and forgets to have a good story, if this is the direction of the next Avengers then we are in for a bad time.I don't recommend seeing this in the theaters, wait for streaming."
4," It was just okay for me.
",theemuhammede,/user/ur63827208/,17 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was overly advertised as the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Phase Five. It also set to have Kang the Conqueror who was depicted to make Thanos look like a walk in the park. Marvel really puffed up what this movie was going to be, and it did not deliver.Before reading any further, if you are a die hard MCU fan, then you will most likely disagree with my rating and review of this movie. That is okay.About 90% of the movie takes place in the Quantum Realm, but it did not introduce anything new about it. It lacked any depth into strengthening its value and place in the MCU. It just seemed like if Ant Man and the rest of the main cast were fighting on one of the distant planets in Star Wars; it was just there with no build to the greater hierarchy.The dynamic between Cassie Lang and her father, Scott Lang/Ant Man, was absolute garbage. If you rewind the clock, Ant Man was stuck in the Quantum Realm back when Thanos snapped his finger. He was gone for five years before luckily escaping, and that was lost time he could have had with his daughter. When they reunited, it was heart felt and full of emotion. That was the last of seeing their relationship. Then now Cassie had so much resentment towards her father, and it went unexplained. What happened from then to now?Kang's character was a joke. He was not the threat marketing/advertising made him to be. He lacked conviction, and he lacked that villain presence that fuels fear. Even at the end of the movie, Ant Man himself was reflecting on their battle, and he literally brushed it off his shoulder like one would after tripping and falling then just simply picking yourself back up.If anything, the end credit scene is what really setup for the future of the MCU. Honestly, it felt like what Dwayne Johnson did with Black Adam's end credit scene where he had Henry Cavill return for a Superman cameo. What is the point of that? Overall, save your money and wait for this to stream on Disney."
6," When Marvel meets star wars
",alexbazelos,/user/ur151621159/,17 February 2023,"First film of Phase 5. Special case for Marvel since it had to introduce the first appearance of Kang the villain who will accompany us throughout Phase Five. The real KANG and not the one we have already seen in Loki.The movie was more or less what I expected. Lots of cgi as we had seen from the Trailers, lots of action and quite entertaining.There were some things where you say ok Ia m here and I am watching a Pixar movie. Personally aside from She Hulk, I have had nothing but complaints about this whole Disney Marvel thing. I am not saying that the movie is bad because of some scenes that maybe were a bit invalid for Marvel and more reminiscent of a Pixar movie, they were just completely out of character for a movie that has to show a lot of seriousness since it introduces the new main villain of the universe Anyway, Honestly, the whole setting of Quantum realm reminded me of star wars. The environment the weapons the characters of this universe even the costumes of the actors were like the movie was set in one of the planets of star cities no joke.Still I think Ant man is just a good movie. Entertaining, the cast excellent as in the previous films. Kang will be a dynamic villain who I believe will show even more tough elements in future films Dynamic credit scenes."

",kitingaomotoso,/user/ur136239546/,17 February 2023,"Like I have always said marvel hasn't been the same since 2019. This movie was the most overrated movie of 2023 lazy writing, lazy plot, cringe jokes, bad acting performances. MODOK was the worst part of this movie. Ruined an avengers level threat villain and made him look stupid. The only positive in this movie is Jonathan Majors as Kang, he Put on an outstanding performance And took the character of Kang serious. Another positive were the post credit scenes which sets up so much for the future of the MCU. Hopefully marvel don't ruin it. Overall a mediocre movie.

",toranxzz,/user/ur38267244/,17 February 2023,"Ant-Man is the one character who saved universe. His power is so unique that there are none else can replace him.But marvel did it again.The world of quantum and creatures living there are just likealians from goth and Thor movies.This is already so sad to admit that the theme of quantum is ruined just because lack of imaginationwith those movie makers.And how many old marvel comics fan have been waiting first appearance of modok to be a good villain.It was such a huge waste for the character!However Kang has good first appearance as true villain but too weak to be the next Thanos. Only Ant-Man and wasp was enough to defeat him.Seems like there will be thousands of Kang for the upcoming avengers movie. But that's quite similar to what we saw with Ultron.I don't even know what he would like to do .Huge waste for the potential of iconic characters
Typical model of lose quality for quantity.Doesn't even make me excited for the appearance of Loki.Hope you marvel studios wouldn't ruin this character as well."

",balathehedgehog9,/user/ur48162014/,17 February 2023,"""Linear and simplistic"" ""paper thin plot"" ""tropes slapped together"" ""derivative, disappointing waste of time"" ""forgettable"" ""lacking depth"" - other reviews posted here.I'm sorry, did we watch the same cuts of Ant Man 1 and 2? And if so where can I stream those? Because I remember the first 2 movies being exactly all that. The Ant Man movies have always been some of the most mid, inconsequential, skippable movies of the MCU. It's positively ludicrous to claim this movie is a significant downgrade from the first two movies like the scores show, unless the only thing you cared about was Luis because everything else is the same in terms of quality. Except of course the villain, Kang, who is extremely compelling, threatening and acted.Shout-out to the guy who said ""Remember the menacing villain who made you feel uncomfortable and tense not knowing what was going to happen next?"" about the previous Ant Man villains. No dude, I don't remember Darren Cross (generic money hungry maniac), Sonny Birch (just a plain dude with no powers) or Ghost (lmao can't even remember her real name) being menacing or making me feel uncomfortable. Kang did though."
6," A bit unfocussed
",FeastMode,/user/ur104603847/,17 February 2023,"I enjoyed watching Quantumania. It's a mostly solid and fairly entertaining movie. But relative to MCU standards, it's a bit underwhelming and feels like more of a throwaway movie than something memorable I will keep coming back to.My biggest issue is that I wasn't fully engaged for at least the first half of the movie. I was enjoying it but I wasn't locked in. The story was unfocussed. When the villain becomes prevalent, the movie jumps a level. But it doesn't completely make up for the much weaker first half.The other thing that surprised me was not being mesmerized by the visuals. It's very creative and I didn't notice poor CGI like some others. But it didn't wow me like it frequently does. Maybe we're just getting spoiled with the visuals in movies like Doctor Strange 2 and more recently Avatar 2.There is still a lot of good here. It's pretty funny but doesn't overdo it. This is the second movie in a row where the MCU seems to have dialed back on the ""insert joke here"" strategy. It's probably a result of the negative reaction from the cartoonish Thor 4. Also, I love the villain. I won't say who in case you're smart and don't watch trailers like me. But he's so damn awesome.As someone who loves almost everything in the MCU, Quantumania is near the bottom of my MCU rankings. And it's making me a little nervous that it comes only two movies after Thor 4 which is below it (5 stars). But I still have faith and am not fatigued. Phase 4 has three of my favorite entries in the entire MCU (Shang-Chi, Loki S01, No Way Home) and I only disliked two (Eternals, Thor 4). They just need to be more consistent while also not playing it so safe. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 2/16/2023)"
8," Best of the latest MCU entries.
",aheartofdorkness,/user/ur23785412/,17 February 2023,"I had a ton of fun with this one. The action was well done and I laughed at all the right moments. The humor did not really feel forced like some other recent MCU entries. The villain is actually a villain rather than a sympathetic individual whose actions are villainous but intentions noble. That is my primary concern with the last several MCU films.The performances from returning actors were just as fun as previous appearances and the new actors all did great. Especially Jonathan Majors as Kang. That guy is amazing.The use of LucasFilm's Volume set technology made a big difference in how the actors interacted with their unearthly environments and made it more believable.Most of the creatures were also very well designed. There was one CGI character that was kind of off, but their design would have been difficult to pull off regardless of budget. I still liked the overall end result despite my reservations.I think this is the best Marvel movie entry in awhile."
5," The Beginning of Phase 5
",tmoser1434,/user/ur45593195/,17 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp return in Quantumania.This third installment loses all the charm and charisma of first two films. Especially Paul Rudd's, Scott Lang, who takes a back seat (in his own movie). Most of the fan favorite characters from the first two films also do not make an appearance here. The film relies heavily on CGI and special effects, making it difficult to establish emotional connections with the characters.The one character who stands out is KANG. Jonathan Majors makes a big impact with the role and stands out amongst the cast. Get use to seeing Majors, he will be showing up a lot in the MCU.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania feels like a setup movie for future MCU projects rather than its own story. Majors carries the film with his on screen presence and makes his mark on the MCU."
7," Big Ideas, Small Story
",dmoorejr,/user/ur61394704/,17 February 2023,"Ant-Man's 3rd solo outting. Doubling down on the sci-fi elements of the MCU. Overall the humor was like the rest of the previous movies. The cast was all stellar. Doesn't really dive that deep into Kang's story, but what we did get was sufficient. Johnathan Majors portrayal was excellent, just wish he had more substance to work with. The visual effects were definitely spotty. Blue screen overload, wish they took more time blending in the effects with with actors. This leads into Modok, as a concept. I didn't mind his backstop changing, just wish they went more practical with his design. Overall Quantumania was a pretty fun movie, but for setting the tone of ""PHASE 5"", Marvel will definitely need to step up their storytelling, and start getting more into detail with these characters, and concepts."
8," Marvel: A return to ... fun
",rsewolf,/user/ur71251551/,17 February 2023,"Over the last few years, the Disney/Marvel have lowered the bar. I went into this movie hoping I get back at least 50% of my ticket value in entertainment. I got back 95%.This is quite simply and enjoyable movie. There are explosions, there are weird things, and your eyes will be overly amazed at rhe visuals.But, there is heart and fantastic acting. A few chuckles along the way to breakup the clashes.If you are looking for a nice Marvel movie - surprisingly Quantumania does its job.I said there are no spoilers - but... for 20 years Marvel has made sure the workers in the credits get viewed, this movie is no different.So, there is a post credit ending."
6," An Ant-Sized Plot
",noahbmayfield,/user/ur84563566/,17 February 2023,"Don't get me wrong, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" started out very strong. Lately, Marvel has had a tendency to rush through their movies without any room for viewers to breathe, but I can honestly say that this one refreshingly differed from that trend. Everything that had to do with exposition was enticing, to say the least. I really thought Marvel was finally going to get back on track with reviews.However, by the time the final battle ended, I just felt confused. There were so many incredible moments in the movie. The characters were great and the set up of Kang and the future of the MCU was flawless. So why did I feel so... empty when it was over?It's really quite simple: there was no plot. For a movie with so much going on, there really wasn't much going on.As a set up for what's to come, it was well done and enjoyable. But judging it on it's own, as a single movie, it just wasn't made with a story in mind. As an avid fan of the Ant-Man films, and a constant to defender of 2018's ""Ant-Man and the Wasp,"" I'm disappointed. There were so many interesting ideas that Peyton Reed could have used for a great story, but instead, we got a ball of excellent moments with nothing to tie them together.It's not bad... But it isn't exactly f-ANT-astic either."
8," Not mind blowing but generally fun
",jmanutor,/user/ur108995390/,17 February 2023,"I think Marvel fans have been mostly affected by this past year with bad deliveries. This one is not bad. It's a good start for a new phase and we should give them a chance. The after credits are good. The story is not bad, the only think is i would've liked more tragedy in Ant-Man movies, something more intense or maybe less predictable. I missed Michael pena as well but generally the movie holds it's comedy side really good. Let's see how Loki 2 and the rest of the upcoming marvel features are for 2023. Kang has potential to be a great villain and i can't wait to see him interacting with other superheroes."
2," Yet another lackluster Marvel movie...

I had my doubts ever since I saw the first trailer but I still tried to give it the benefit of the doubt. It wasn't enough.The movie lacked character, action, many plot points fell flat, so many set ups and expectations went out of the window and, as per Marvel's recent habits, the visual effects are obviously unfinished.I almost feel bad for the actors, they tried their best to elevate a mediocre script to no success. Paul Rudd and Majors are standouts, Scott Lang is as charming as ever and Kang is an interesting character that demands expansion. The rest of the main cast also tried their best and delivered enjoyable performances.I obviously cannot dive into more details without spoiling important plot points but, in conclusion, this movie had the potential to be exponentially better than what we actually got and it's a shame it ended reminding me of the plot and visuals of the Sharkboy And Lavagirl..."
10," Not sure why this is isn't higher rated or have more praise, I loved it!
",UniqueParticle,/user/ur34836174/,17 February 2023,"To me it was a spectacular IMAX experience although there was several errors in the auditorium before the movie there was no commercials with a blank screen longer than usual and after the movie the sound went out it took multiple attempts from the projector to see the credit sequences that's never happened in all years of seeing movies usually sound stuff happens at the beginning. The important aspects after this just wanted to express I had a peculiar experience with a few errors.Anyways about the movie I love the magnitude of science mashed throughout, loads of humor more than most Marvel movies, great action, and wonderful story! No matter what anyone thinks of the movie Jonathan Majors deserves awards in his career even its not this his performance was exceptional and Kathryn Newton is so much prettier than ever before. All around magnificent I love this Ant-Man a lot. Hope anyone appreciates my thoughts if anything I have autism I love being the odd one out from most."
8," It's really a 7.5
",Hiya_Georgie,/user/ur129215936/,17 February 2023,"PROS: Very enjoyable, lots of humour and mostly glorious visuals. The building of the entire world of the Quantum realm seems effortless, yet it is thrown to your face instantly. Performance wise, Majors and Pfiffer are the heavy hitters. It is a bold, risky and ambitious first step into the future of the MCU and that alone deserves some acknowledgment.CONS: Kang and MODOK both felt underused. The main plot is pretty basic, yet it's not deepened by the numerous other elements. So don't look for any philosophical counterpoints like in Civil War between the opposing sides. MODOK is supposed to look weird, but they could do a lot better than just stretching a face. The result of the final fight makes you question some already established facts about the new Saga, but it can still be reconned.Overall, it's just a fun and lighthearted movie. Not perfect, but still a lot better than the last few missteps since the conclusion of the Infinity Saga."

9," Very entertaining
",jerhliang,/user/ur42601606/,17 February 2023,Not sure what the hate is. Family really enjoyed this movie. It was very entertaining. I liked it better than Ant-Man 2. Can't wait for rest of phase 5. Maybe it was a little too long? But overall very enjoyable. It was very different than the other Ant-Man movies. It's very sci-fi. And I think that's actually a good thing. Maybe they should explain the backstory a little more? I guess you might have to watch the TV show Loki to understand some of the backstory. Definitely stay after the credit. There are two end credits scens. Again not sure why it's getting bad reviews. Maybe people expect too much?
10," Best MCU movie Since Endgame.
",goshamorrell,/user/ur59184301/,17 February 2023,"All that is out the window with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, the third entry in the series and the first to kick off an MCU phase instead of capping one. Not only does director Peyton Reed's movie take place almost exclusively in the Quantum Realm (exploring it much more extensively than ever before), but it also puts Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and company up against the next major Marvel menace: Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), a power-mad tyrant who can move through all of space and time. He threatens not just ""our"" reality, but every other one out there. Most of the film takes place at a far remove from the Marvel Universe we know, down in the subatomic Quantum Realm that characters from previous films have visited (Ant-Man), gotten stuck in for decades (Ant-Man and the Wasp) or used as a series of temporal highway bypasses on their way to saving the universe (Avengers: Endgame). Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has just enough entertaining moments and a heartfelt family story, plus knockout performances in Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet van Dyne and Jonathan Majors' Kang the Conqueror, to make up for its more underdeveloped aspects. The exploration of its central themes, new characters, and the Quantum Realm itself only goes skin deep, leaving it feeling high on spectacle but low on substance. Even so, Quantumania works as a culmination of the Ant-Man series, a way to start things in motion for Phase 5, and a promising roadmap of where the Multiverse Saga is going. Of course, many MCU fans may wait and see what audience scores are like. Generally speaking, audience scores trend higher than critics for most superhero offerings, and I would probably expect that to be the case here. But I would be surprised if this was a huge disparity as this always seemed like a pretty risky film. I also think it may be worth noting that so many new Marvel films keep popping up in the bottom ten here, like the even higher profile Thor: Love and Thunder and Multiverse of Madness. The MCU does feel like it's has its magic in phase 4 here. Serenely untroubled by pressures to break box office records or win Oscars, the Ant-Man films seem content to be clever entertainments with heart, but not so much that they become cloying. From the size jokes to the running gags to the casting of Rudd, who has spent his career behaving as if he's a random regular guy who stumbled into stardom and finds it all quite silly, the series manages to be light but not inconsequential, whether a given scene is sentimental (anything involving Scott and Cassie) or cheerfully deranged (the climatic fight at the end of the first movie atop a Thomas the Tank Engine train set). Ant-Man is officially a member of the MCU's starting lineup, the Avengers, but feels like a replacement player who gets a text when Thor calls in sick. This new movie validates Scott's not-quite-insecurity (he's not deep enough to be existentially tormented) by having him get mistaken for other superheroes. He takes it in stride. Two films ago, he got fired from Baskin-Robbins, and before that, he was in jail. Happiness, like size, is a matter of perspective."

",taylorsimon-54156,/user/ur72560190/,17 February 2023,"The critics have fair points when they talk about the excess cgi, but it's the quantum realm - what are we expecting here? The Godfather? Is Avatar the only franchise allowed to barf cgi at us with a mediocre script? Come on...Majors was great, the script was passable, and I laughed a ton. It was on par with Guardians 2, a fun flick with little depth but a great night out at the movies.It would have been nice to see a little more justice done to Kang's character, but I suppose this is just the beginning.Looking forward to Kang Dynasty and Loki S2. Curious to see how the timeline develops!"
1," Great Star Wars rip off.
",cmhouse,/user/ur156109619/,17 February 2023,"It was the best Star Wars rip off since Space Balls. It took the MCU for Disney to give us a decent Star Wars movie. Kang is emperor Palpatine, MODOK is Darth Vader, Ant-Man is Han Solo, practically every character plays one or more stand-ins of Star Wars characters. They even rip off the cantina scene from New Hope.If you enjoy this movie it's all because you have a good time laughing at all the scenes and aspects they rip off from the original Star Wars trilogy.This isn't a good MCU movie, but it's a decent and fun Star Wars rip off.1/10 as an MCU film. Would've been a 10/10 if Disney marketed this as an MCU spoof of Star Wars because I cracked up everytime this movie turned into a Star Wars rip off."
6," ""Twelve dollars!?""
",daisukereds,/user/ur26579233/,17 February 2023,"Continuation of what I considered to be the weakest part of Ant-Man 2 : Janet van Dyne's adventures in the Quantum Realm. It's sad that her part in this film is so miniscule, which doesn't help it's case.Not entirely sure if this is a better sequel than ""the Wasp"", as the strange pacing at the beginning and a lack of action and cool set-pieces not only hurts repeatability, but even the first watch. The story is also very linear and simplistic, with plenty of dull and flat moments, while exuding ""wanting to be more"" but doesn't get there. There are no layers or payoffs, and I wish we could do without many of the tropes it uses (as they feel tiring by now). ""No risks, no thrills"" as they say.The CGI is good and has great designs! And most of the cast is enjoyable as always!But then, there is the matter of the villain.. Considering it is an Ant-Man standalone movie with the expected structure (and Peyton would wouldn't have the stones to do otherwise), there's only one way things end!We also get, story-wise, a ""weak"" version of Kang. Which isn't a good look to what is going to be the threat moving forward.And on the back of my head, I kept thinking : When the entire multiverse spits out whole branching universes when someone decides to do something (see Loki's series), actions start to seem pointless. And the appeal of our versions of the Avengers (now that the ""good ones"" are gone) starts to diminish.. Could I be watching an Ant-Man movie from a more interesting time-line instead?Wouldn't go out of my way to watch this on theaters! There's nothing really to be spoiled."

",vinyladams,/user/ur155222577/,17 February 2023,"This film is not only all over the place, you also will not care for the characters as they are too busy going through the motions of this horribly written film. The action is sub-par, the characters are more focused about avoiding the realm rather than learning more about it, and the most shocking part is that Paul Rudd is absolutely not funny in this. To the film's defense, it is not completely hopeless. It introduces some cool ideas and people, like Bill Murray's cameo, but instantly, like him and everything else good in this movie, it's killed off and ruined by the horrible things about this film. You need a strong pillar to support a big structure, and so far, this film is a pillar that has snapped in half."

Kang part was completely new so although the story was loose sometimes but in order to know what the kang will do, how he will behave and how he will become superior than thanos, i was completely submerged in the movie and i am just curious for new movies.

What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense.

," The Golden Goose is cooked, a new low for the MCU
",eddie_baggins,/user/ur8462477/,16 February 2023,"Arriving on TV sets in 1977, beloved American comedy series Happy Days aired its now infamous Hollywood: Part 3 episode that was made notable for a scene in which Henry Winkler's Fonzie proceeded to conduct a water-ski stunt involving a jump over a shark, leading to the coining of the phrase ""jumping the shark"" representing a moment where things have gone too far, past the point of no return.A sad moment in 1977 for Happy Days, 31 films into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) it's time we now call it as it is and say that Marvel has now cooked it's golden goose.It can't be denied, Marvel had an incredible run from the moment Iron Man entered the pop culture space in 2008 and for years following the Robert Downey Jr starring hit the comic book behemoth delivered some of the most enjoyable and entertaining big screen spectacles we could've asked for and while they no doubt stuck to a formula many now berate as being the death knell of quality cinema, time and time again Marvel proved to be masters of juggling characters, spectacle and entertainment (often against the odds), culminating in the double pronged attacked of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame that tied off years worth of work in spectacular fashion.From there on out however things have taken a sharp turn towards entering the water, strapping on a set of skis and finding a willing shark to hold position as its launched over with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania a new low for the modern age Marvel brand name that follows in the not so impressive footsteps of last years misfires Thor: Love and Thunder, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and the OK if far from memorable Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.Kicking off the championed ""Phase 5"" of the MCU, Quantumania finds Paul Rudd's once charming and likeable every-man Scott Lang have his solo venture hijacked and turned from a fun and carefree heist/comedy of often hilariously tiny proportions into a lifeless and convoluted set-up for what's to come as we enter into yet another alternate universe, quantum realm, 8th dimension and whatever else Marvel wants to conjure up to cover up having to explain things or make much sense in what is a narrative out that has now become part and parcel of their storytelling devices in what started out in a fun fashion but has quickly grown overly wearisome.Forgoing most of the aspects of the Ant-Man brand that was never outstanding to begin with but found fans of many ages on a global scale, Quantumania gives little thought to laying out much groundwork, throwing Lang and his offsiders that includes daughter Cassie, partner The Wasp (poor Evangeline Lilly, getting to share a title but not an ounce of worthy screen-time/character development), in-laws Janet and Hank (equally underused Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas) into the quantum realm where they come across Jonathan Major's new Thanos level big bad Kang the Conqueror, a character that could offer hope moving forward but gets little if any memorable moments here in an underwritten and uninspired main entrance.Not convinced Quantumania sets the new low standard for the MCU and causes great concern for the ability of the future of the whole shared universe idea? I am sure the CGI'd butt cheeks of how did that pass quality control M. O. D. O. K, a little hole loving alien who utters the phrase ""milk juice"", the site of Douglas strutting into another mindless big city battle with a horde of ants flanking him in what's akin to the worst version of The Charge of Rohirrim you could conjure up or just the general sense that no one cares enough to even pretend will surely do the trick.It's been an incredible run but now all we can do is sit back and watch as the MCU gathers speed and launches itself out of the water for one spectacular if miss judged jump.Final Say -Ladies and gentleman it's time for Thor: The Dark World, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and Eternals to move aside, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is now the worst MCU film yet with all the signs pointing to it likely moving aside itself as the ship it's a part of slowly but surely sinks.1 1/2 over priced coffees out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"

Granted, I enjoyed the entire movie, but only because of how much fun I was having laughing at the general stupidity of the film.Negatives: Bad plot, bad acting for most characters (especially with many forced lines), terrible CGI at many points, bad humour and the quantum realm does not look aesthetically pleasing.Positives: The only points where I wasn't laughing at this mess of a movie was when Kang the Conqueror was on screen; a genuinely scary character in an otherwise awful movie (with an awful ending).

Quantumania is definitely not what I wanted it to be, I expected a lot more from the film. It has lazy writing, cheap performances and extremely weak CGI and VFX, which was really important considering that almost all of the film is shot in front of a green/blue screen!

I haven't been this uninvested in an MCU movie since Thor 4 and Captain Marvel. Like another reviewer said, who even cares anymore?First of all, the first act of this movie is probably the worst first act of any MCU movie I've seen in a while. It's also artificially made boring and uninteresting because they do this stupidest trope of one character hiding something from the others and not telling them until the middle of the movie and their explanation for it is ""I wanted to protect you"". Protect her from what? An angry guy with the size of an atom in the Quantum Realm? Not telling your family of ""scientists"" about the actual dangers of Quantum Realm and then getting mad when they eff with it is protecting them? I hate this trope so much because there's no point to it. The only reason they did that was to postpone introducing Kang and showing his flashbacks till the second act.The first act is completely boring but it gets just a little better and more interesting when they introduce Kang. But the movie gets boring and uninteresting as it goes anyway.There is no character arc in this movie. Marvel, or rather the writers they hire have forgotten how to write scripts anymore. They don't even care enough to have character arcs, so it's no surprise they don't do any characterization for the new characters either.Remember the first Doctor Strange movie? Remember his memorable character arc throughout his first movie? Remember when MCU writers had an iota of an idea of how to write a movie and make the audience actually care about the characters and have interesting characters? Remember when they actually tried? Now compare that to the second Doctor Strange movie where he doesn't even feel like the main character of his own movie, now imagine something that's somehow even worse and you get this movie.I don't even know who's the main character of this movie. Scott Lang doesn't have a character arc in this movie. Her daughter wants to help the resistance people for some reason and Lang who is the ""hero"" apparently, doesn't care and doesn't even change at the end. Things just happen and they go through it and that's that, no character growth and no nothing.They for some reason again mislead us in the trailers that Scott wants to help Kang because he missed Cassie's childhood. But this is nowhere to be found in the actual movie. Now I know about Marvel trailers and that they have misleading footage and stuff that aren't in the movie, but they aren't usually as misleading as this one. And the funny thing is, this could've worked better than whatever cliché we got in the actual film.Also, what's with the kid genius trope we keep seeing in these movies? Why does every child of these superheroes have to be a genius scientist and inventor all of a sudden? Can't they be a normal child with normal lives for once? All of them have to invent some multiverse-bending device in their garage that even Tony Stark couldn't've made?And speaking of the resistance people, please show me someone who actually watched this movie and cared about them or even remembers their names. The writers don't even do the bare minimum of characterizing them. You won't care about these people or their uprising and revolution when watching this movie. You won't care about any of them dying.This movie was only made to introduce Kang and nothing else. The writers don't care about characterization or character arcs or even writing a decent plot with what they've got. Why even make this movie when we had Kang introduced in Loki? This adds nothing and is repetitive. You don't even need to see this movie if you have seen Loki. Somehow Loki gave more backstory and characterization to this next big baddie of the MCU than this movie, and he was only in the last episode of that show, so you go figure!It's obvious that they saw the backlash and mediocre reactions to Phase 4 and decided to make Kang the villain of this movie and start Phase 5 with this to set him up as the next big villain and hype people up again, and they failed miserably at that.MODOK's design and CGI are somehow even worse than the floating head in Thor 4. It's probably the goofiest and worst thing I've seen in a while, and his character doesn't even have a place in this movie. The design of his armor when he's not showing his face is alright, but my god what an atrocious monstrosity! I don't even know what they were thinking designing him like that. Even Marvel's Avengers game had a better design than this, and that game had the blandest and forgettable face designs ever. And the only reason he was in this movie was to have something connected to the first Ant-Man movie. He doesn't serve a purpose in this movie and they even dare thinking we would care about him.Speaking of the first Ant-Man movie, that movie at least knew how to be a little fun movie about Scott Lang and a reasonable throwaway villain, not a giant world-ending event with a big baddie that's out of Ant-Man's league. If you've seen The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, you know that all the Avengers combined can't even defeat Kang, but here we are with Ant-Man and the Wasp and his daughter saving the world from this omnipotent god. And this omnipotent god has robot soldiers that somehow die from a paintball bullet. This is why it's tricky to have a villain that's omnipotent, because you make it harder for the audience to believe that he would be this dumb to have prison cells that can be opened if you stick a fork into their control panels and robots that die from a punch and him getting defeated at the end somehow.And this is one of the biggest reasons Phase 4, and apparently Phase 5 now have been a huge disappointment for me, especially for the Dinsey Plus shows; the fact that each and every one of them has to end with a huge gigantic clusterfk of an ending and third act, with two Kaijus punching each other. Shang-Chi that's about this father and son? End it with a big fight in the third act with a giant Dragon. Moon Knight which is a street-level superhero? End it with two Kaijus punching each other. Black Widow? Some CGI vomit of bad action in the sky or something. Eternals? Same Kaiju fighting. Same with What If and Ms. Marvel. Just have a big battle or even a full-on war like Wakanda Forever in your third act. Just have ""world-ending"" ""stakes"" in each and every project of yours, doesn't matter how big or small the superhero is. I think pretty much most of the audience apart from the Marvel fanboys have gotten tired of this formula since a long time ago, I don't understand how the producers and writers haven't yet.This movie is also CGI galore and I don't think there was even one real set. The actors probably still never met each other and all of them were shot separately.I also remember when they said Ant-Man couldn't take his mask off if he's small or big, but here we are having him enlarged to the size of Kong and having his helmet off easily like it's nothing. There's no difference in pressure on his body and his head when he's large and takes his helmet off. So what's even the point of having a helmet in the first place? Just stab yourself with one of those blue enlargement pills ;) and get big or small.I have rambled a lot, but the more I write, the more I realize I don't care about this movie and it's probably better to stop wasting more time on it and move on.All in all, this movie is a big disappointment and fails at pretty much everything it does or tries to do. There is no characterization or character arc, there is no real tension and you won't care about anything and anybody because they don't take time to develop characters, the movie is full of tropes and clichés and all in a bad way, Kang has a better introduction in Loki, the movie is all CGI and action and is somehow on par with Eternals on how boring and uninteresting it is.The M(id)CU continues to be mid and they are progressively getting worse with writing actual decent plots, characters, and villains, and I don't think most people care anymore about what the next MCU movie is gonna be about (apart from GOTG3) and which version of Kang we're gonna see next. The hype and excitement and investment people had MCU has significantly died down since Endgame and I don't think most people now care about what's coming in the future.I don't even have a morsel of hope in what they're gonna do with the X-Men, Blade, Daredevil, and Fantastic Four. If they can't even think of a good story to tell for Ant-Man and Wasp and they just throw the next big baddie in there to fight, they probably will have ran out of ideas by the time they're gonna make X-Men."
7," fantastic visuals, lays foundation for more stories
",rafaeloyarzo,/user/ur162398901/,16 February 2023,"The movie has great visuals, and it sets up for more stories to take place. The animations and choice of colours throughout the film looks great. This movie sets up great potential for more stories to take a place in the MCU. The character interactions throughout the movie have some pretty creative/hilarious moments. This movie tonally is less light-hearted, and less contestant humour like other recent MCU films - which i enjoyed this.However, some things that I did not like - with the exception of Scott Lang, why is almost every major character in this film a scientist? Scott Lang's other non-scientist friends make zero appearance in this film."
4," Had huge expectations from this film but...
",nicktsantekidis,/user/ur68005236/,16 February 2023,"I anticipated this movie for so long. Especially I wanted to see Kang a character which i loved in Loki season one. Unfortunately the movie disappointed me a lot. Why ?-zero plot
-Michael Douglas just throwing lines
Paul Reids ""daughter"" trying to save everyone because she is going through a revolutionary phaseWhy i tried to like?Jonathan Majors performance . I believe that if he was given an actual script he could have elevate the movie into an another level.Pure disappointment and really bad start for phase 5. Please make more Marvel Movies like the old marvel movies And set aside this Disney childish mentality where everywhere there is a happy family that love helps win all battles."
5," The downfall of Marvel is sad to watch
",jpkaramanolis,/user/ur62025836/,16 February 2023,"It's been a few minutes after i left the cinema and i still cant believe that was the introduction to Kang! That's the big bad guy we are supposed to fear in the future of the MCU?? What's wrong with Marvel lately? So, the movie was really good looking except a few awkward fight scenes and a god awful CGI face (those who have seen it know who i'm talking about)... The humour was fine but a bit tiring since the movie didn't know if it wanted to take itself seriously or not. There were so many scenes that got ruined because of out of place jokes that shouldn't be there, there were some boting and uninteresting side characters and side plots and it felt like they realised how bad the movie was when it was too late... Kang is ruined as a villain as well as the Avengers movies... The worst start for a phase in the MCU ever! I don't want to spoil anything so i can't say much, but overall a really bad film that had no direction."
7," 3 Wasps against Kang in Quantumania, ft. Ant-Man
",nakrugt,/user/ur13860020/,16 February 2023,"I am writing all this as a normie, I do not know anything about the comics and stuff. It is just a film.So, It is not... bad, but a disappointment.Three Wasps against Kang in Quantumania, ft. Two Ant-Mans/Ant-Men. It is basically a plot revolving around three wasps Janette, Hope with Cassie, and Scott and Hank doing their best. The first fifteen minutes or so, we watch every character mocking and sh.tting on Scott about... everything he does and he has done.One important question I had while watching: In the first film, they established that the smaller they get the more indestructible they get as well. So, in the quantum realms, they must me invincible, right? Even though they get huge for quantum realm? So why do they bleed and stuff?!As for Bill Murray cameo, I was really happy that it was not Jeff Goldblum. For a second there, I thought ""please, don't let Goldblum do a cameo in this film!"". That would have been annoying.The whole film is just green box filled with CGI, but how else were they going to pull it off, right?I do not want to spoil the ending even though there is nothing to spoil, so I will not give any details. The ending is the same as the endings of The Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 and The Rise of Palpatine. Come on Disney, write a different ending for once. Fire your writers and hire a much cheaper Artificial Intelligence chat bot or something."
9," Part of my MCU top 5
",serenarotaru,/user/ur69201884/,16 February 2023,"Firstly, I can't get the hate around this movie. This is the PERFECT beginning for Phase 5. I absolutely loved this movie, with it's bad CGI in some places, with some bad dialogue, with some obvious plot holes... But, man, this was good.Would you love it if you're not an MCU fan? No, probably not. Would you love it if you're a crazy MCU fan? No, probably not. But if you go in expecting to see some great visuals and a compelling story, yes, you'll love it.Kudos to Jonathan Majors for the amazing performance, congrats to Rudd, Lilly, Pfeiffer and Douglas (not you, Cassie Lang, you were meh) for amazing portrayals.Looking forward to phase 5 after seeing this!"
9," A Way Better than Expected
",nizarsalim,/user/ur139489183/,16 February 2023,"In Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania, there are a lot of things and elements that deserve praise. The story and its depth and elements, addition of the independent world of the Quantum Realm, soundtrack, actions scenes, visual and sound effects, direction, screenplay, performances of the cast (especially the one of Majors), comedic moments, entertainment value, ending, which certainly points out that there is still a lot more to come in the future of the MCU, along with the mid and post credits scenes, finally, all deserve all praise.But from my point of view, what I liked most in the movie is the way it presented Kang, which confinced me now that he is a lot more dangerous threat than Thanos.Regarding the flaws, the only thing that I didn't like in Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania was the GCl design of MODOK, which could have been made a lot better.I didn't expect Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania to be in this good level, especially after I saw the mixed reviews that critics gave it on various sites. It is an excellent movie, and I enjoyed it to the max. When it comes to the score, I gladly give Ant-Man and the Wasp 9 out of 10."
8," Judge for yourself
",craig-conway7-817-15719,/user/ur47306443/,16 February 2023,"Not a perfect movie by any means, but I could easily put it in my top10 MCU films. These movies never rate highly anyway, infinity war only had a Meta score of 68 and many people would say it's the best one.Yes, it does a lot of universe building, but name one MCU film that doesn't build towards the bigger overall storyJonathan Majors is amazing to watch, performing this version of Kang with a slight undertone of burden weighing on him, but brutal and ruthless at any given moment to ensure his victory. I can't wait to see his take on the multiple versions of Kang over the next couple of years.The only thing that I don't agree with, was the decision to 'kill' Kang. But, without the foresight to see where the overall plot is going I will hold judgement on that."
4," Ok, but nothing to be blown away by
",chirilescemanuel,/user/ur159375088/,16 February 2023,"I'll try to make this review as short as possible.The reason why I graded this a 4/10 is because not of the movie being bad. It was interesting, altogether, but nothing to get out of the ordinary.Expected nothing, but a little more from the villain Kang, the Conqueror and/or the outcome of the story come to pass in the Quantum Realm.It felt like the finale we have seen soo many times, but with all different characters in it.I believe He Who Remains, presented in Loki series was more refined as a character, had a more complex of a personality as a villain. Kang the Conqueror felt like, he was presented as overpowered three quarters of the movie, then... not anymore.I've got no problem with happy endings, but I felt a lesser ammount of effort put in the story told then most Marvel movies.I'm looking forward for the future of MCU, all time, always."
10," Marvel Finally returned!
",alzhranimoath,/user/ur134066536/,16 February 2023,"Finally ant-man and Wasp: quantumania arrived bringing with it a fresh start for the phase 5 and I can't describe how happy I am. Clean movie, good characters, fantastic acting specially form Paul Rudd, peak villain and side villains. The movie gave us a brief about Kang and what he capable of, and a big picture of the villain that we will see in the next phases. The movie also showed us a perfect story for Scott with his family and how he tried to stop his daughter to be like him. I loved how we saw the old friend Darin returning as M. O. D. O. K and how he changed during the movie. In conclusion the movie is good and perfect start for phase 5 and I hope that they will keep it like this."
10," As a science fiction fan, this is a great sequel to the first two Ant-Man movies.
",marashianbehnam-23780,/user/ur76193887/,16 February 2023,"Impressive visual effects, cool technology, fun action sequences and hilarious gags. This Ant-Man sequel had it all. I'm a science fiction fan, and yet this movie is truly enjoyable. Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathryn Newton, Jonathon Majors, Tony McCarthy, Bill Murray, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Peña, Michael Douglas, Randall Park, William Jackson Harper, Hannah John-Kamen, Walton Goggins, David Bertucci, Bobby Cannavale, David Dastmalchian, Judy Greer, Corey Stoll, Wood Harris, Sean Kleier, Gregg Turkington, Katy M. O'Brian, Ruben Rabasa and Patton Oswalt all played their roles very well. What a great MCU movie."
5," Its an ok movie but not as good as the first two.
",josephbarros-16407,/user/ur123831522/,16 February 2023,"Looks like phase 5 is going to start off much like how phase 4 did...very poorly, which is a shame because I loved the first Ant-Man movie and the sequel, but this third outing feels like it took 3 different types of movies and stuck them together. I enjoyed the first act of the film, the 2nds act tho absolutely dipped in quality and performance and the 3rd and final act.....smh just went absolutely bat crazy and overdone with with CGI. I thought Aquaman's 3rd act was all over the place in what was going on but this was another level of ""what the heck is going on"".I also notice they are trying to being the back the shaking cam combat....please dont, it was rubbish to watch then and still is now.Personally I am not a fan of the third film, it started off strong but then like most the MCU films since phase 4 the quality just vanishes into its reliance on comedy which I am sorry to say is just past its time now."
8," An entertaining watch
",masa-81061,/user/ur130954177/,16 February 2023,"It's an entertaining watch and I left the showing in a good mood, so that's a win for me. Jonathan Mayors portrayal of Kang stole the movie so I'm excited for Phase 5. Of course, there are some things are were a bit meh but it didn't impact the movie in a mayor way. An ok movie.The length of the movie was perfect, not too long, not too short. Overall it was a fun movie, I don't know why everyone expects an Oscar-worthy movie everytime the MCU debuts a new movie, they know their audience.The CGI was good, not great but good. A step up from THOR: Love and Thunder, FOR SURE.The comedy wasn't overdone thankfully, there were some missteps and bad timing but it was bearable."
10," This movie aint getting enough love.
",parkkila-21,/user/ur54902097/,16 February 2023,"This is my first time Im writing an review. Beacause this movie rate is to damn low. I think the marvel fans are spoiled and dont appreciate a good movie. Problably to high expectations. But Marvel have also pumped out to many movies and series. ""Less is more""Good things about the movie.The cast is amazing, loved Jonathan Majors Kang. Terrifying character, cant wait to se him in Avengers. MODOK is a win, hope we se variants of him in the future.Story is good. Take it for what it is. An Antman movie. Great humor. A family movie. Liked that Scott is trying to keep Cassie out of trouble, and mentoring her how to use her powers. Sometimes when they are in quatumrealm I get the feeling of a star wars movie and thats a good thing. I liked the movie took place in quatumrealm. Its a great place to explore. And makes the movie exciting.Action is great, I think that Antman is underratted. Loved Scotts and Kangs hand to hand combat.Some less greater things. I wish they took Kang more seriously at the end. That Scott must feel they need to prepare for Kangs future arrival. Asemble a new avengers team."
4," Marvel are... well, just boring
",FattyBoomBatty,/user/ur2144344/,16 February 2023,"What is it about most Marvel films that makes them so BORING. Is it the juvenile scripts, probably, predictable story line, likely, unrealistic locations, maybe, or the effects that no longer have any wow factor, I think so. The whole bunch of franchises are just there to suck the cash out of the pockets of fan-boys/girls who are desperate to believe; really the films have a lot in common with the emperor's new clothes. How about diverting some of the cash into making something original, films were story is paramount, are engaging, have believable characters and effects that make us believe it is real."
3," ""Civil War level movie"" my a**
",alensufli,/user/ur44051699/,16 February 2023,"Quantumania feels and looks like CW made a budget TV movie about aliens with a few renowned actors for 8 years old kids but parent attendance is a must so they can let kids know that this is just a bad movie every time the kids get
confused by the plot as sometimes adults even can't tell what's going on there.The beginning didn't start bad actually but nothing much happened. Hank has a big tank of genius ants and Hope is more successful than ever. The only thing standing out among mid performances was Cassie. Not in a good way though.Another nosy, arrogant, unlikeable ""prodigy"" girl from Marvel's new strong female characters factory swarmed
the whole phase four with its annoying karens. The other problem is that the actress herself has zero talent. Truly. Her sadness was as much authentic as Kim Kardashian's tears when she cried for her lost earrings. I guess Brie
Larson left a huge impression so they decided to hire another talentless mean girl boss.In the second act, there was this embarrassingly unfunny joke about ""holes"" made by a poorly rendered bubbly cgi being and the joke has been even mentioned in the middle of a serious fight in the third act. They also
introduced a telepath guy without explaining what type of character he was: mutant? Witch?, inhuman?, they said
nothing about him but they used him as a macguffin to read the mind of a robot(is it possible? None has been mentioned) to help to crack some code for literally 3 seconds. I can swear I saw a broccoli-headed character in close-up several times and I thought it will have some purpose later but nothing happened. Do you remember when they showed us Bill Murray in the first trailer so we can think that he gonna be part of something big? Yes, he was there but only for 5 minutes. Maybe even less. Then they killed him off and that was it. I guess he was there so Hank can make Janet jealous by saying he also had someone when she admitted that she has been screwing Bill Murray for 30 years bcs she has ""needs"". But in the end, they turned their backs and never mentioned this again. What a family.When finally they gave us Kang in the third act I saw the desperation to give more to the character in the eyes of
talented Jonathan Majors. He delivered more than what was written in the script, I am sure. Although bcs of the lazy writing the character did not intimidate me. They gave us a glimpse of what he has been up to before he was cast out to the quantum realm but the writer made the same mistake that has plagued the whole phase four. He relied on the power of words instead of visual proof. What Janet saw in her visions when she touched Kang's machine was not enough. Although why on earth the man who can travel through time and the multiverse didn't make his machine to respond to him only? That's weird right?, whatever. Even when he captured the rallies he just imprisoned them. No actual killing took place until the last 20 minutes.By the time we arrived there, I was expecting him to kill some of the main characters so Scott can have an even bigger reason to fight against him. It didn't occur, unfortunately. The only things he murdered were a few unknown cgi characters that I don't even remember what they looked like. Remember I mentioned Hank had a tank of smart ants? Yes, they travelled with their daddy to the quantum realm and immediately created an enormous advanced society with the power of socialism as Hank himself explained(not a joke, this what he actually said) so they can turn into a plot device at the end to fight against Kang's super-advanced robots. When they ask Hank how did this happen, his answer started with ""somehow"" and after that, I didn't pay attention much tbh bcs it was nonsensical and boring. In the end, even Scott wasn't sure of what exactly he did there. Also, my biggest disappointment was neither Kang nor the others mentioned any connection between Kang's machine, the ten rings of Shang Chi and Kamala's bangles.That was the most expected thing by almost everyone but I guess MCU got tired of their own formula. But they are forgetting that very formula forged MCU in the first place.Quantumania is promising something good in the beginning but gets off of its trails very quickly. It's a very disappointing misfire at the beginning of a new phase. I am not even sure about the Guardians now. But definitely gonna skip The Marvels.I gave 3/10 only because of my respect for a few actors."
9," my opinion
",Ahmedfadil00,/user/ur106024418/,16 February 2023,"Many will not like it.. who are in a hurry to finish the story always.. this movie is for those who want to enjoy quietly and slowly.. like food when it is cooked slowly.. I really enjoyed the movie.. the movie was successful in my opinion because when the two hours ended, I was shocked how it went Quickly.. I did not pay attention to the time.. The photography and the visual effects were very, very excellent.. The presentation of the character of Al-Ghazi was awesome, especially the first scene after the ending song. Very excited about the new part of the Avengers. It deserves the 9 stars.. I was hoping The end will be sad."
6," Quantumania is the beginning of the fifth phase of the Marvel series, but has little story of its own.
",movieman6-413-929510,/user/ur34790048/,16 February 2023,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the third Ant-Man film and is again directed by Peyton Reed, who also directed the previous two Ant-Man films.Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) enjoys his increased popularity after saving the world along with the other Avengers. Scott's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) emulates her father's criminal activities, but also investigates the Quantum Realm. When she accidentally opens a portal, she is sucked into the Quantum Realm along with her father, his girlfriend Hope (Evangeline Lilly), and her grandparents Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank (Michael Douglas).To get back home, they follow Janet's advice, after being trapped here for years. In the Quantum Realm, they encounter many different creatures, some of which are hostile. Scott meets the mysterious Kang (Jonathan Majors), who promises to help him get back home, but whether he can trust Kang remains the question.With this film, the Marvel series begins their fifth phase. Unfortunately, this leaves little room to create your own story. This film almost largely only serves as preparations for future films in the Marvel series. Many things and new characters seem to be of little importance. The story of this film can therefore seem a bit messy and is sometimes difficult to follow.It is a special task for Peyton Reed, because he can start the first film of the fifth phase. Furthermore, he will have the chance to introduce important things for this stage in the Marvel series. For this film they also made more use of LED technology. This technique is increasingly used in the film world to replace green or blue screen technologies and provide more realistic backgrounds in the front of the film. This new filmmaking technique became popular with its use in the Star Wars TV series The Mandalorian. Peyton Reed has directed two episodes of this show.He takes these techniques, atmosphere and images to his third Ant-Man film, so that the film sometimes comes across as a cheaper Star Wars film. These effects work even better on the small screen of TVs than on the big screen of cinemas. This may also be due to the qualities and talents of the director. In this film, during some scenes you can see that the background is fake. This can also be seen with some CGI characters. For the character MODOK she tried to combine CGI and motion capture, but ended up with a separate and unbelievable character. This character is so hard to take seriously and is reminiscent of older movies from the 90's where she first introduced CGI to the movie world.The acting is done well by most of the film cast, but due to the amount of different characters and the messy story, everyone doesn't get the same amount of time to make something special out of their roles. Paul Rudd knows how to provide suitable comedy moments. Fortunately, the comedy is not too strong either. Michelle Pfeiffer gets more opportunities to come forward in this Marvel film. She even has some action moments, which are reminiscent of her from Catwoman. Michael Douglas gets a little less playing time, but does have some sarcastic comedy. Besides the fact that Evangeline Lilly can finally wear a superhero costume, she unfortunately doesn't get much else to do.Kathryn Newton replaces Emma Fuhrmann in the role of Cassie Lang. Although Emma has only played the role for a short time, seeing a new face to the character can take some getting used to. Kathryn Newton fortunately plays the role well in her own and energetic way. Jonathan Majors is also returning to the Marvel series, only now playing a variant of Kang, a similar character he previously played in the Marvel TV series Loki. Here he gets the chance to portray his character in other ways that also respond more to Marvel's future film plans."
4," A tease for something spectacular that may happen later (for real this time, we promise)
",TheVictoriousV,/user/ur19932818/,16 February 2023,"When I praise the older MCU films, I may seem tough to please, as I expect these movies (which, of course, are part of a larger, increasingly complicated tapestry) to function as their own thing while also making sense as Shared Universe components. Truth be told, it's arguable whether the older films were wholly satisfactory in that respect.When Captain: America The Winter Soldier came out, many praised it as a decent standalone sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger -- with some useful context supplied by adjacent media, but it raised that franchise-old question of where everyone else is right now. Then we got Civil War, which brought in a lot more characters -- sans a few whose absence makes canonical sense -- and so functioned better as an MCU chapter, but if your interest is squarely in the Cap trilogy, will you truly understand it if you watch it right after The Winter Soldier?Ever since Phase Four, it's been trickier than ever, not only due to the sheer number of characters and stories to account for. Almost everything is a tie-in to and/or tease for something else -- not necessarily within the same ""trilogy"" or ""series"". Some works do try to stay in their own corner of the MCU (at the expense of making it clear what unifying Endgame all of this is building toward), I guess for simplicity's sake, yet they keep introducing threats, McGuffins, and entities so awesomely powerful that it makes even less sense for the Avengers to not at least call a quarterly meeting about the sh-t that's been happening lately. Even a witch with the capacity to destroy every world in every universe is an ""adventure of the week"".Anyway, now we have Phase Five, starting off with Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania and with it new questions about the Marvel Multiverse and the rules of time travel and universe-hopping. And yes, you're gonna need to see Endgame before this one, lest some plot details come off as headscratchers if you -- for some weird reason -- only care about the Ant-Man films. (Disney+'s Loki might be of use too. Oh what, you didn't know there are shows too now?)Paul Rudd reminiscing about the time he spent with the Avengers isn't so bad (in a pre-MCU superhero film, a line like that could be an Easter Egg for devoted comic readers), but much is still lost if you jump straight from Ant-Man 2 to this. I know watching any particular solo series within the MCU is a fool's game at this point, but I can't stop thinking about how I'd much prefer if this was all one big TV series or something, preferably helmed by an organized creative team who are in agreement about the rules.Quantumania also retains the Phase Four tradition of hurriedly introducing a bunch of new heroes to set up the next Disney+ title, which will almost certainly be a whole-ass TV show because a serialized narrative is more likely to keep fans subscribed than just plopping a singular film on there. As usual (and as per the traditions of the source material), it's a new version of an old hero. Scott ""Ant-Man"" Lang's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton; nowhere near as good as in Three Billboards) comes away from this adventure with her own size-altering suit and is effectively Scott's sidekick. The Wasp of the title (Evangeline Lilly) feels weirdly sidelined.We also get to meet Kang the Conqueror, the adversary that's supposed to tie all of these increasingly disjointed movies together. Inevitably, numerous plot/lore questions arise. (""Is this the Kang that the Variant in Loki warned of, or is there a more terrible version yet?"") All the same, Jonathan Majors steals the whole show and the menace of Kang is mostly felt (making us believe he may indeed prove to be scarier than Thanos -- though I would've preferred that Kang was first discovered by Doctor Strange or something; not someone who's always functioned as the chief ""regular bloke"" of the Avengers).His Quantum Realm empire is shot (and designed -- see the various microscopic lifeforms made titanic) in such a way that it actually feels both epic and minuscule at the same time; a Jules Verne-inspired lost world that's vast, yet too imperceptibly small to be explored by normal humans. I feel like Michelle Pfeiffer's character owes a better explanation for why none of this was mentioned after she escaped the Realm in the previous film, but hey, what do ya do?Quantumania is at points fun -- giving me hope that we are indeed building towards something spectacular, FOR REAL THIS TIME -- but largely, it's just ""another one""; a film that could've been truly out there, but wasn't permitted to stray too far from the Kevin Feige vision.One complaint viewers had about the MCU back in the day was that, while it was still full of snappy dialogue and drama-deflating jokes on the one hand, it often also tried too hard to seem grounded on the other hand, like they were still afraid to embrace the comic-book silliness and instead tried to find ways to make these characters seem halfway ""real"" -- often by making the costumes look less fantastical/colorful or having ""self-aware"" comments about the ridiculousness of it all. What's appealing, to some people, about everything post-Infinity War is that the movies dare introduce all kinds of comic-book madness, but most Phase Four films' version of ""being sillier"" is having characters become dopes.And the movies do still exhibit that same self-consciousness. This isn't like RRR, which is even more balls-to-the-wall insane than the Marvel films but also has characters that take their own universe seriously, resulting in a movie that's both funnier and more dramatically effective. If you wanna go see Quantumania, go see it, but the unusually low ratings thus far tell me I'm not alone in feeling a bit weary and that the proverbial Superhero Fatigue is finally here. If you want to be on the safe side, I recommend just staying at home and popping on RRR. Or the previous Puss in Boots film if you wanna see how the side-villain MODOK got his acting industry start when he portrayed Humpty-Dumpty.Funny side-note: In the movie, we see that Lang's career with the Avengers has led to a life of luxury and stardom, making it all the more strange that Falcon has to deal with financial issues and Dhar Mann-tier racist cop archetypes in his own show. Don't yell at me; I'm not saying it's bad when you contribute to a piece of world-building yet elect to change its rules in accordance with a Message™. I'm just saying ""Ah, that's our post-Endgame MCU. May you one day be as chaotic as the DC-verse!"""
8," The beginning of Phase 5 was so impressive!
",darishkakoroleva,/user/ur158311982/,16 February 2023,"Spoiler Free: I got goosebumps and for me that means the movie was a success. Frankly speaking, expectations were a little too high and those who watch the film will understand what is at stake. However, I am ready to give 100 out of 10 to Jonathan Majors for his game! His tears in his eyes throughout the scenes amazed me. This is really a very, very good villain for Marvel. And I'm sure that despite all the action in this film, in the future, this character will have a much more reverent and intriguing motivation than Thanos. I personally liked Kathryn Newton, the motivation is written quite well for a teenager, and in general, I hope the potential of the character will be well revealed in future projects. Not 10 out of 10 for sure. But the beginning of Phase 5 looks quite impressive!"

Paul Rudd is turning Scott Lang into an appealing underdog, one ant at a time...and I can definitely get on board with his skills being essential in the trials and tribulations ahead.On the other hand, this movie has a vibe of stumbling through this landscape of mystery with one arm tied behind his back and two eyepatches. Echolocation works best in the courtroom-ask Matt Murdock. It has no place in an establishing prequel.Respectfully, it has no right posturing with two posters, and relying on a post credits scene advertising Loki and Morbius' next adventures coming this summer. Just, no."

I'll review it when I can, I swear! That's basically what Ant-Man 3 feels like. A few simple conversations, a couple confessions, and most of the problems in this movie would have been resolved. However, I was happy to see that it isn't too tied into other MCU properties, and it does offer some resolution in the end.

The action and CGI were pretty good, and it was fun, but it dragged in some places until I began not to care much anymore, only to be sucked right back in. They provided quite a believable story about Janet's time in the Quantum realm that I didn't have to suspend disbelief.Kang was pretty badass, and I can understand how he can evolve into more than a Thanos level threat. I feared for Scott's life more than once, especially with Marvel's penchant for getting rid of earlier avengers nowadays. And Jonathan Majors is an excellent actor.In all, this was a decent watch, nothing spectacular, but it still had enough to keep me glued until it came to an end. I did find it underwhelming, but considering that I went in more than hyped for it, the fact that I can still think of it as a 7 tells me Marvel did well with this one.

Even though I missed greatly Michael Peña and his comedy.Ant-man almost since the very first minute starts with action and never stops, the involvement of the family with his daughter Cassie plus the characters we already know is a fun additionm and shows more purpose to Scott Lang.Kudos to Jonathan Majors and how he plays Kang. Now I start to understand why he is the new ""big baddy"" for Marvel. He plays an interesting and powerful villian, he is not fully developed but since he seems to be more present in the future I guess they have a plan for that. Can't wait to see whats next."

I found myself laughing at how ridiculous it was several times.Being filmed almost entirely on green screen really affects the visuals also. There were several shots/scenes taken right out of other films so noticeably that it takes you out of the movie. Very disappointed.The trope of ""there's no time to tell you that I've been lying to you but you'll have to trust me blindly now and do exactly as I say without question"" is getting old.I'm glad I won tickets and didn't pay to see this."

",ericgoldberg-50159,/user/ur154745300/,16 February 2023,This is the same Marvel movie Disney has pumped out over and over again. Visually nice but storywise not so much. The story starts off incredibly convoluted with the Quantum Realm being a dream land of ridiculousness. The movie is very slow until Kang the Conqueror shows up halfway through the movie. Jonathan Majors plays the part well. The only thing is we've seen a tyrant try to take over the universe and his name is Thanos. Thanos was supposed to be the most powerful being in the universe because he had the Infinity Stones but now Kang seems to be even more powerful for absolutely no reason at all. I'm getting tired of the same repetitive stories in Marvel movies and now there will be more with Kang being the next Thanos. Oh well. That's Disney for you.

The visual were good but actors are levitating in their green screens and it's jarring, everything is so dark that I could barely see things in some scenes. Ex machinae everywhere, the actors had no chemistry, and so and so.The ugly: not enough ants.The movie is a mess.

We wanted to be introduced to a fearful character, but instead we have a powerful character with little impact to the plot. Which is not the actor's fault, but the scriptwriter's fault.And with the entire movie being almost full CGI, we should have good lightning, which is not the case. It's like having a gray filter on the entire movie and characters. Everything feels dull. The costumes of the main characters, and espacially kang's one feels colorless. Kang's costume is made of green and purple, but it looks more like bad gray and black.In conclusion : bad acting, wrong lighting, disappointing plot, cringe jokes, and bad cgi from time to time.Wait for the movie to come out on Disney+ and don't waste your time and money by going to the cinema."

Jonathan Majors absolutely shines as Kang and elevates the entire movie as does Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer.

",condythug,/user/ur68707814/,16 February 2023,"Big fan of the MCU movies since the 1st release.As usual, this is a solid Marvel movie but slightly underwhelming b'c Kang was portrayed (in my opinion) to be less powerful than the ultimate villian that he was made out to be thus expectations of giant fireworks/fights were not really met. When compared to Thanos, Kang doesn't feel as powerful or engaging to viewers. His story so far is just not as gripping as Thanos.Story is ok but not great with a few plotholes around. I have a feeling that the overall quality of MCU movies has taken a drop since the peak of 2019 when MCU movies were really really great. Graphics are top class as usual.Well worth a watch."
6," Not great
",seige-hound,/user/ur39024931/,16 February 2023,"There are parts of this movie that I genuinely liked, and other parts that are really really mediocre. I wouldn't say bad necessarily, but just really dull and disappointing.So first the good. I do think Kang has a lot of potential, but it hasn't quite been filled yet, and it was a good thing that Loki was the first view of this character concept instead of this one. Kang is building up to something big, and this step on the ladder is one that falls just a little short.So my main issues with Kang specifically are that a lot of aspects of his character are as of yet unexplained. His power set is vaguely powerful. He has telekinetic powers, and can shoot beams that can vaporize people, but he gets overpowered by giant ants? Ok, I guess.I just hope they show him to be a bigger threat than Thanos. Thanos in Infinity War was so incredibly powerful, and I am yet to be convinced that Kang is any more a threat.So for the other stuff. This movie is just a boring Star Wars ripoff. So you're telling me that this amazing Quantum Realm is just Space again? There is literally nothing distinguishing the Quantum realm from anything that has been in Guardians of the Galaxy. Not only that, but the Star Wars comparison goes all the way down to having rebels, people who play both sides, faceless goons, etc. The only difference is you have to shrink instead of fly into space to get there.They really had an opportunity to get goofy with it, and they just didn't for the most part. The most creative part is the alien that you drink his juice in order to understand the quantum realm's languages. That's it.With MODOK, I'm sort of mixed with him. I like the way they introduce him, and explain why he looks like that, but it feels like they can't decide whether to make him a comic relief character or a competent secondary villain. And him heel-face turning at the last minute because Ant-Man's daughter told him to not be a dick was just dumb. Way to kill off another interesting villain from your comics, Marvel. Please stop doing that.Speaking of Ant-Man's daughter. Ooof. I don't think it's the actor's fault, but damn she's annoying and badly written. They try and make her sort of this woke zoomer archetype who gets arrested for protesting a homeless removal effort, but it felt like a comittee of boomers were writing this character to appeal to zoomers instead of actually paying attention to what they're actually like. Cool she has a suit though.What else? Um...Hope had next to nothing to do. She was just there for the ride. At least Hank Pym did the ant thing with the smart ants, and Michelle Pfeiffer was the instigator of the plot, and should've been the protagonist to be honest.Yeah, that's it. Watch it for Kang. Rest of it is dumb."
2," a decent movie rapped inside a smelly shell
",namob-43673,/user/ur60195330/,16 February 2023,"I had no intention to see this movie, but sometimes walking around with the wrong people they lure you into things you should have avoided. This movie I should have avoided.So the good things is that the visuals are (mostly) great, the acting is decent, and we get a few new interesting characters in a good natural way although I assume some will complain about that. And... uhm... well, the costumes are pretty nice...Most of the rest is meh, boring sludge, and badly written. I am not necessarily stating this is a bad movie. However strange it may sound, looking at the 2/10 I give this, there is a decent movie here somewhere. The problem is that around this decent movie is a layer of nonsense, a lot of propaganda and a basic premiss which is beyond contempt.Worst for me though is the 25yo daughter (how did she get that old?) and the actress in question. Horribly written Mary Sue character that very few will like.I cannot even tell you how badly done this movie is. Marvel has really dropped it. My last hope is The Marvels since I loved the first Captain Marvel Movie. If that is as bad as this and the previous movies Marvel has insulted us with that is it for me. Out. Permanently.Marvel have thrown away all the goodwill, and this movie is a perfect example of that."
6," A classic Marvel in a quantum space
",AvionPrince16,/user/ur104763420/,16 February 2023,So yeah the movie is pretty classic: a vilain and a hero who will fight. But the quantum space part was pretty interesting: we see also some familiar face from the previous movie. And the vilain Kang was pretty badass and thats great that we know that he will return in the next movies. The reference of Thor was pretty surprising and maybe a cross over for the next time? Maybe. Sound good. So what else to say about the movie? Its still have that comedy side and was pretty funny sometimes. It have some revelations about Janet and when she was in the quantum space and how she met Kang and what she did in the past. It was interesting anyway and it still have some nice special effects. It was pretty good but classic in all the way and will not give anything surprising except that we learnt a little bit more about the mother and Kang the new vilain. But was pretty entertaining anyway. Im still surprised that they put more and more sexual jokes even if its pretty subtle but its there. Nice anyway.

",seepooha,/user/ur19616271/,16 February 2023,"Just came back home from cinema... Was never a fan of the Antman arc because his story always felt the least logical and the most grotesque. And this time again, the whole concept of ""quantum realm"" looks almost ridiculous. Creators of this film tried really hard to invent something out-of-this-world as Quantum realm supposed to be. But probably the task was impossible to accomplish from the beginning.Even though computers (maybe even AI) generated unlimited variety of visual effects, the plot holes are huge and the scenes are as standard as they get. Fight scenes, the bar scene, a weird alien, a super-mighty villain who suddenly loses his power (because otherwise he would be impossible to beat), a brave worrior fighting for freedom of her people, etc. - we saw this many times already starting from the first Star Wars.Plot is very inconsistent.

And they owe the success all to Jonathan Majors aka Kang the Conqueror.Kang is the scariest Marvel villain I've seen. He's definitely scarier than the purple grape Thanos. It was all thanks to Major's commitment to the impenetrable character. His tortured to menacing facial expressions, bellowing voice and naturally imposing physique convinced me this was a super villain. No CGI needed.I literally saw the movie because of Majors, and I'm glad I did.For the rest of the cast, they did a stellar job too. The surprise MVP was Cassie. She had gumption, daring and humor like her dear dad. (And a gorgeous face, like a little Julianne Moore. That Lang/Van Dyne family is really ridiculously good-looking.) Michael Douglas was also surprisingly funny. Overall it was great to see the superhero family communicating and defending together.Ant-Man Quantumania will take you on a fantasy, philosophical journey, where you can both escape your life and contemplate it.I do look forward to seeing Kang disrupt other Avengers in coming sequels, and the classic Ant-Man franchise humor.P.

1," Falls Short of Marvel's High Standards
",mikeskooper,/user/ur135661240/,16 February 2023,"""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" had all the makings of a great Marvel Cinematic Universe film: a charming cast, a unique premise, and a director with a track record of success. However, the end result was a messy, unfocused film that failed to live up to its potential.The film picks up where its predecessor, ""Ant-Man and The Wasp,"" left off, with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) now a fugitive after the events of ""Captain America: Civil War."" Meanwhile, his former love interest and fellow superhero, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), is still searching for her mother, Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), who is lost in the quantum realm. Along with her father, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and a new character, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), they set out to explore the quantum realm and rescue Janet.At first glance, the plot seems promising. The quantum realm is a fascinating and mysterious concept that has been teased in previous Marvel films, and the addition of Kang, a major comic book villain, adds a new level of excitement. However, the execution is where the film falters.The plot is convoluted and messy, with multiple storylines and characters vying for attention. Scott is dealing with the consequences of his actions in ""Civil War,"" Hope is focused on rescuing her mother, Hank is grappling with his own guilt over Janet's disappearance, and Kang is... well, it's unclear what Kang's motivations are until the third act of the film. The result is a film that feels unfocused and lacks a clear sense of direction.The characters, too, suffer from the film's lack of focus. Scott, Hope, and Hank are all likable characters, but they are given little to do beyond spouting off exposition and reacting to the various plot developments. Janet, who was hyped up as a major character in the film's marketing, is given even less to do, relegated to a few scenes in the quantum realm where she dispenses some cryptic advice.Kang, meanwhile, is a major disappointment. Jonathan Majors gives a charismatic performance, but his character is so poorly defined that it's difficult to care about him. He's a time-traveling conqueror from the future, but beyond that, we know little about him until the third act of the film. By then, it's too late to develop him into a compelling villain.The humor, which was a highlight of the previous ""Ant-Man"" films, also falls flat. The jokes feel forced and repetitive, relying too heavily on the same gags that worked in the past. There are a few bright spots, like Luis's (Michael PeÃ±a) rapid-fire storytelling, but they are few and far between.The action scenes, too, are a letdown. The film's marketing promised a trip through the quantum realm and an exploration of its wonders, but the actual sequences feel uninspired and forgettable. There are a few creative uses of the shrinking and growing powers, but they are few and far between. The final battle, which takes place outside the quantum realm, is similarly underwhelming, lacking the tension and excitement of previous Marvel films.In the end, ""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" is a forgettable entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film's lack of focus, underdeveloped characters, and uninspired action make for a disappointing experience. The quantum realm, which had so much potential, is squandered on a messy plot that fails to explore its wonders. The humor, which was a."

We get some real action, and the jokes, while some pretty dull, still mostly work.The acting performances are really strong, especially from Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne and Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conquerer.Also, Cassies relationship with her dad Scott was thought out really well, they did good too.The movie brings back old characters from the previous movies, which I was happy to see.The most outstanding of those surely was MODOK. The way his background story ties into this movie is amazing, and while he may look weird at first, it's a fricking giant head. He's supposed to look weird. But of course, as the Mcu always does it, it nerfs the interesting characters like him to the ground, makes him get beaten by a teenager and the gets killed off after a mind change out of nowhere.Which brings us to the disappointing parts:Even though the cgi was praised in the trailer, it certainly lacks quality in some of the shots, the most noticeable being while they are entering the quantum realm, they look really blurry compared to the background.The movie struggles to keep the tension up in the middle of the film, but that's acceptable because it got right to the point at the beginning and had to keep it up for almost two hours.Also, the solutions to many problems aren't really explained, we are just told to believe that it works this way and the characters know what they are doing. Most noticeable moment of this was, when Janet all of a sudden knew how to get them out of there again.Further on, Kang suffers from similar problems as other Mcu villains, the moment he sees something he wants, he gets tunnel vision and runs blindly towards it, instead of trying to figure out a smart way to get there. This is shown most noticeably in the ending fight.That's exactly where I want to pick up. What happened to fricking Kang the Conquerer? This is supposed to be his most evil variant. Getting overran BY ANTS? Come on guys, why did you have to nerf him so hard...Also I'm pretty unsatisfied with the ending. I hoped we would get one same villain just like Thanos again, but now we just get hundreds of variants? Seems a bit messy, but that seems to be the theme of the recent phases anyway...The post credit scene slapped tho, you should definitely stay in the cinema for it.So that's my review of Ant Man: Quantumania, it sadly didn't deliver quite what I was expecting, but its definitely a step in the right direction of the Mcu."
8," Not as bad as rotten tomatoes says.
",ashersour,/user/ur135103842/,16 February 2023,"Have seen it on a early screening Monday and went back to check it yesterday. This movie is nowhere near as bad as critics (especially rotten tomatoes) say. Yes, there are a few mistakes in the movie, there is no denying that. But the story is amazing, the plot is really great, along with the characters. The family dynamic is still there. It doesn't feel like an Ant-Man movie, where I believe are the mistakes. The whole good vibe of the first two is nowhere to be seen in this one. Characters like Luiz are missing. Acting performances were great and bad, Pfeiffer and Mayors stand out, while Newton has some work to do if she wants Cassie Lang to grow in the MCU. Douglas had a weak performance as well. Overal a 8/10."
5," Basically Marvel's Worst moments stitched together with Fun moments of the old days.
",imxhill,/user/ur119341314/,16 February 2023,"The first half of Ant-Man and the Wasp:
Quantumania is REALLY bad. The writing, the directing, the visuals, and the performances all range from mediocre to straight up awful.The entire quantum realm (or world, whatever) reminds us of the Star Wars franchise in some ways, but is ugly. It is sanitized and modified to be consistent with the MCU aesthetic for space and multiverses (Doctor Strange, Loki, and Guardians etc). It feels like we are supposed to be wowed by everything, but it is just worse, corporate-made, soulless, AI-generated versions of what we all saw before. From the creatures to landscape to overall colors and visual aura. Is it too much to ask for some new, different visual takes on MCU? Comparing this to The Way of Water which came out just 2 months ago, you can really feel that less care and precision is taken care into each MCU movie.The 2nd half of the movie, while didn't fix every single problem I had, was entertaining to watch. The stakes are there unlike the first half, more interesting stuff to grab your attention, and the final battle is mix between Star Wars prequels and Aquaman with the Ant-Man characters. Even though I did have *some* fun with this, I cannot help but think why can't we have movies that are fun from beginning to end. CBMs like The Suicide Squad or The Batman. Doctor Strange 2 had way more interesting directing choices than this. Why can't the biggest film franchise in the world have more soul and artistry? Movies like Eternals and MoM were criticized a lot but I'd rather have those movies over something like this.I'm really struggling to give this one a rating. It is a mixed bag, there are so many aspects that bother me giving a positive rating, but then I remember having fun. Maybe some time passes, those momentary fun will evaporate from my brain and just a bad movie will remain in my memory. The comedy didn't really land, none of the performances were outstanding besides Jonathan Majors, this really is another MCU product. But a worse one than usual. Hell, I forgot to mention how this is basically another 'setup' movie. No significant character arc or consequences and the ending is just another return to the status quo. I've been a casual MCU fan that watches their movies when they come out and have some fun, but lately the decline in quality & my investment and enthusiasm is Very noticeable. I really feel like James Gunn's DCU will surpass MCU in 2020s if this trend continues.Maybe I'm being too harsh, again, since I did have some fun, but this is my review."
4," Worst ANT-MAN Movie.
",TK-1227,/user/ur147764979/,16 February 2023,"This latest Ant-Man movie is the most disappointing movie in Marvel as a whole. Of course, this movie is not without merit. But its advantages were buried by its disadvantages. That's why I thought after watching the movie, ""There's definitely something wrong, but I don't know exactly."" The downside I thought about is, first of all, that Kang came out too weak. Kang's setting of being more powerful than Thanos has become retire in vain. It's a plus to be pushed and floundering by ants. (In comfort, a lot of cans came out of the cookie video and gave pressure?) Second, the story is too thin. From the fight between freedom fighters and their overthrow targets to the hardships of freedom fighters to the hurrah of the family. The problem is that this is it. I couldn't handle the thin story to describe Kang's strength and wickedness. Janet hides her past in the beginning and releases a large number of settings around the middle, which only delays the flow of the play and bored her."
7," Dont trust the critics
",sbszqbxn,/user/ur137612231/,16 February 2023,"I dont understand why they gave this movie a lower rating than Thor: Love and Thunder and Eternals because it is so far off those two movies in a way that Antman and the Wasp: Quantumania is enjoyable and those movies were dead ass terrible. My advice, dont trust the critics because im sure they didnt bother to watch all 3 movies or just dont understand the MCU. The Only thing i didnt like was the character arc of modok in the end. He could have been a challenging villain for them but they just had to make him redeem himself and help them in the end. Overall, 8/10 would watch again and Dont forget to stay for the 2 post credits scened!"
8," It's never too late to stop being a jerk
",TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,/user/ur2093818/,16 February 2023,"Some of the greatest scientists in The Multiverse band together to try to make a trilogy closer that will be both well-made and popular.A lot of people have already talked about this being tonally inconsistent, not only with the other entries, but also with itself. That it more resembles a Star Wars than another Ant-Man. I'm not going to argue those, merely state that I think it's being blown out of proportion. The movie is different, yes. Bad? No.I really appreciate that the theme of family is continued, and deepened. The drive to protect those near and dear to you was a major aspect of the first two. This time, we also have the aspect that some of them hide things from each other, to keep them safe and out of a fear of losing their love. It calls out the complacency that can come with success in doing good. This also gets into communication and media, and their role in societal change. Violence as the only solution to a dictatorship.I recommend this to any fan of the MCU. While it does try to be welcoming to newcomers, It is definitely catering to those of us who want an ongoing storyline. 8/10."
10," Loved the movie
",info-17153-03195,/user/ur155870298/,16 February 2023,I really loved this movie and I like how Kang and his variants are so scary and powerful. We saw what one Kang can do. Can't wait for infinity amount of kangs!!! There was a lot of humor which was way better than Thor. I also liked the fact that ant man is way stronger and has learned a lot of new things in combat. His daughter was kinda annoying though and hanks wife also acted very stupid. Also weird that Kang just didn't kill them he had so many chances. Same as them escaping him. Why not shrink all those times. But whatever I really liked it and loved the characters and places then went I was beautiful!
7," A fun addition to ever growing world of the MCU
",davelikesfilms,/user/ur162376870/,16 February 2023,"Tonight I got the opportunity to see an early screening of Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania, here is my personal spoiler free review of the film.Marvel Studios starts phase 5 into full effect with Quantumania, a fun Ant-Man adventure mixed in with an amazing Kang prequel. This movie delivers the laughs we've all come to love from the Ant-Fam also adding sorta new comer Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton) into the action. While the jokes aren't always slap your knee fall on the floor dying funny, Paul Rudd's likable charisma is enough to warrant at least a chuckle or a smile. The family dynamic really didn't hit as hard as I feel it wanted to, I definitely left the theater feeling a missed opportunity to dive deeper. Unfortunately as well we do see some of the other characters take a bit of a back seat during this adventure, they are there and have a place, I just felt there could have been a bit more from them. I am happy to report that the villain for this film hits the mark on every note as Jonathan Major's Kang the Conqueror is an absolute force to be reckoned with, he absolutely steals the show every time he is on screen and thankfully they left the jokes (for the most part) aside from the menacing presence that is Kang. I walked out of this movie feeling genuinely happy to see such a fun adventure, because even with my nitpicks I had fun, and that's all I could ask for! While I do miss the more grounded stories the Ant-Man films delivered previously, entering this new era of the multiverse saga with the MCU is gonna be a crazy fun ride and I can't wait to see where we go next!"
8," A great movie with a few flaws
",jdhgpr,/user/ur159559372/,16 February 2023,"The movie itself was very fun and important to the marvel cinematic universe Paul rudd was fantastic as ant man and the movie balanced comedy and seriousness quite well.There were two things i thought could have been executed better.The first is Hank Pym, it really felt like they couldn't find an important storyline for him so most of the movie he was just there not really having a purpose building up to the end where he had a purpose that was clearly written for him to have a part in the story.The next thing was the fact the movie kept referring to the main vilian as ""he"" for half of the movie which was quite forced.Overall I think you should definitely watch this movie because it's still a very good movie and important if you are a marvel fan."
1," Surely disney destroy marvel universe
",peraturan-66111,/user/ur162374539/,16 February 2023,"The adventure of Shark boy n lava girl + spy kids sum all of this film. Disney have insert kids character in the recent marvel films, not to be some common kids but become independent and annoying superheroes. Marvel realy dies after Avengers : Endgame. They just realy want to show the ending of this film to make stepping stone to another avengers arc wthout building good plot, storyline and script. How the hell the amateur family members could lead seasoned rebels to launch rebellion against so called powerful conqueror. There is no enough background story about how kang would able to build such a big n massive empire singlehandlely. Kids would love this but not adult."

",vincentkropf,/user/ur140690946/,16 February 2023,"This movie is so awesome, it has pretty good actors (Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, Micheal Douglas and Jonathan Majors). And the story was in my Opinion better than the second one.The special effects weren't as good as these from avatar the way of the Water, but the were still pretty good. It isn't as funny as the first one but you still have to smile a few times. Although the actor who played Cassie was kind of a disappointment because she wasn't such a good actor, but we to remind ourselves that she still is pretty young. I think it's a good Movie and i think the 15 Bucks are totally worth it."
6," Ranks among the MCU's weakest efforts in its execution of both fun and emotional payoffs.
",MrDHWong,/user/ur18374284/,16 February 2023,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is the first film of Phase 5 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Once again directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly in the title roles, it ranks among the MCU's weakest efforts in its execution of both fun and emotional payoffs.Some time after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is enjoying being in the spotlight with the recent publication of his autobiography. While Scott is hanging out with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), her parents Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfieffer), and Scott's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), the group are accidentally sucked into the Quantum Realm, where they each discover it is not as destitute as they had initially thought. Soon, the group learn of a dangerous new threat inhabiting the Realm known as Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who will stop at nothing to escape his fate as a prisoner of this place. As Kang makes his position clear, it is up to Scott and the others to stop Kang before irreversible damage is inflicted on all of space and time.Right now, it seems the MCU is in a strange holding pattern after ""Avengers: Endgame"". Although there have been several films and TV shows made since then, there hasn't really been any concrete indication of what to expect from where the series is heading. This is because even after all these years, we haven't had any proper build-up to whom the main villain will be that is taking over from Thanos. While ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" at least establishes some things to look forward to in the future, it never does so in a way that can distinguish itself as nothing more than a relatively mediocre entry in this already expansive cinematic universe.Given that this film is supposed to kick off Phase 5, it surprises me how few exciting moments there were to hype up the audience. The previous two ""Ant-Man"" films contain some of the funniest, most entertaining scenes that fans like myself have come to appreciate from the MCU after all these years. Yet here, I struggled to find anything remotely enjoyable that could leave an impression on the viewer. Aside from the odd dry banter from Scott, there are no amusing scenes of comic relief to alleviate the severity of whenever something bad has taken place. Most other MCU films have been able to strike a balance between humorous and dramatic but this one leans so heavily on its dark tone that it is simply not fun to watch at times. If the filmmakers wanted make a darker ""Ant-Man"" film, that's fine, but this is not the way they should have gone about it.Another big problem is that the film goes way too far with its overuse of CGI. Though the MCU has used plenty of CGI in prior films, they at least tried to make it look like it had some basis in reality to give the audience the impression that what was on screen could be imagined as physically right in front of the characters. Here, it is used so much as a means to an end that the whole film looks about as realistic as the Star Wars prequels. At no point did the Quantum Realm ever feel like a real place inhabited by its population of various creatures. Instead, we constantly have to watch the actors move around within the limited confines of what I assume is where green screen stages were in ways that looked so planned out that it doesn't match the vibrant environments they are projected against. Everything looks so clean and sterile that it is near impossible to imagine the characters actually being there in any of these locations. At first, I thought maybe I have just become desensitised to CGI in general but as the visual effects kept piling up here, I found myself becoming less and less invested in the story, which has never happened to me with other MCU entries until now.The cast of the film were fine, considering what they had to work with, but I doubt this will be viewed as them at their best. Paul Rudd still exudes his likeable charm as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, who is now treated like a true hero by the general public. I'll admit it's nice to see an underdog like Scott finally get the recognition he deserves after all this time, especially considering the important part he played in helping the Avengers bring back half of the universe's population from Thanos's actions. Scott's best scenes were with his daughter Cassie, with Kathryn Newton now playing the role in place of Emma Fuhrmann. At first, I wasn't sure about the recasting of the character, but Newton proved she was right for the part. Some of the physical requirements for the character seemed to come naturally for Newton and she also had pretty good chemistry with Rudd as her onscreen father.I was somewhat underwhelmed by how Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas were used this time around. For a film that has ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" in its title, we don't really see enough of the titular characters doing things together. Instead, Hope mainly hangs around with her parents, and while this does provide some decent scenes of the three bonding together, it still seems like a strange creative decision to keep her separate from Scott for so long. Additionally, Douglas and Pfeiffer, while not exactly going to waste, didn't contribute as much to story as I had hoped. If it weren't for one crucial scene near the end, I'd say that Hank and Janet's presence in the film was quite forgettable. Most of the time I kept forgetting about them as I cared more about what was happening with Scott and Cassie in the meantime.However, the one character that stood out the most to me was Kang the Conqueror, played by a surprisingly intimidating Jonathan Majors. Anybody who watched the first season of the Disney+ series ""Loki"" will remember this character, who was known back then as ""He Who Remains"". This time, we get a better look at Kang's motivations as a villain and why he is so determined to inflict chaos on all the different multiverses. Majors does a good job at concealing Kang's true personality, whose vulnerability is used as a facade for his malicious intent. I guess I liked watching Kang the most because he is the only character in the film with some kind of interesting end goal, while all the others are only there to try and stop him. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Kang in future MCU projects, as I think he has the potential to be as threatening as Thanos was back in the Infinity Saga.For the beginning of a new chapter in the MCU, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" just doesn't land in the same way as the previous films. It tries hard to be one of the darker entries in the series by upping the ante with its main villain but it ends up relying too much on the audience's assumption that things will be addressed in more detail later on. At this point, I can only hope that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", the next film in the MCU release schedule, will leave a better impression on me and other long time fans because if that doesn't work, we're in for a relatively dull Phase 5.I rate it 6/10."
1," not an Antman film
",gillerner,/user/ur82074825/,16 February 2023,"OMG this movie was soooooo boring!I'm a big MCU fan and I just couldn't wait for it to be over.Bill Murry was a totally useless character .The whole thing was a mess.As a Marvel fan, it pains me to say that Ant-Man 3 was a major letdown. While Paul Rudd is an excellent actor, his performance as Ant-Man was underutilized and failed to leave a lasting impression. He seemed to be going through the motions, with none of the charisma and humor that made his previous portrayals of the character so enjoyable.One of the weakest points of the film was the character of Cassie Lang. She was an irritating and unnecessary addition to the cast, with no real purpose in the movie. Her character was a distraction, adding nothing to the overall plot or the development of the other characters.Another major issue with Ant-Man 3 was the quality of the CGI. It was lackluster and unimpressive, leaving the action scenes feeling uninspired and dull. The special effects failed to create a believable world, with characters and objects appearing stiff and artificial. It was a significant disappointment and made the film feel cheap and poorly made.Finally, the sci-fi and alien elements of the movie were entirely superfluous. They added nothing to the overall plot and were a complete waste of time. The movie would have been much better served by focusing on the more grounded and human aspects of the characters, rather than trying to shoehorn in unnecessary science fiction elements that felt out of place and uninteresting.In conclusion, Ant-Man 3 was a significant letdown and a weak addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Despite a strong performance by Paul Rudd, the movie failed to deliver in many areas. The CGI was lackluster, the sci-fi elements were unnecessary, and the character of Cassie Lang was entirely annoying. It's a shame, as this movie had the potential to be a great addition to the franchise, but instead, it felt like a cheap and poorly made film."
4," Marvel 7, actual movie 4
",kylenorsworthy,/user/ur154502483/,16 February 2023,"Marvel does more of what it does best; make you feel zero emotion at any moment, be berated with ridiculous one liners, create copious amounts of plot armor around the characters, and create more plot holes the ""holes"" jokes made in this movie.Is Marvel afraid of being serious? Of having even the slightest bit of weight at all? At no moment do you feel any sense of danger, concern, our negative emotion to the situation. If you did, you were quickly pulled out by a stupid joke. The only interesting character was Kang any by the end you're begging for him to kill or harm someone to make it remotely interesting.Kangs entire point is that he's supposed to stop the endless amounts of other Kangs from destroying the infinity of multiverses, dimensions, timelines, or whatever. This could've been explained in 2 minutes and prove it to the characters by using the guy who could read minds. If Kang is so smart, powerful, and capable, how the hell was he bested by an activist teenager, her larger dad, ants, and some rebels? Kang has been building an army that apparently has been oppressing everyone but they had ZERO bearing on the story. They were all completely useless. Even his only ""henchmen"" Daron was a complete moron and switched sides to make a dick joke.Why did I not give this a lower rating with such a bad review? I enjoyed Scott's relationship with his daughter. I like Kang. The post credit scene plants the seeds for something larger."
4," Another Quantum leap backwards for the faltering MCU with one of the worst villain portrayals in quite some time.
",tresm87,/user/ur11839633/,16 February 2023,"The days of MCU mania seem to be desperately hanging in the balance due to ridiculous forced comedy and terrible casting decisions. While still leagues better than the abhorrent eternals, and aboit on par with the terribly underwhelming love and thunder, ant man 3 doesn't do much to break out if the consistent mediocrity of the MCU in the last few years. The film tries so hard to do so much that the world building isn't even memorable for future films. The casting decision of Jonathan Majors as Kang is about the worst I've seen for the franchise. This guy has no place being a classic marvel villain and doesn't come close to being even serviceable. Easily the worst aspect of the mediocre film. The MCU is officially in MAJOR(S) trouble."
7," Good but not great
",cannabinosa,/user/ur117406976/,16 February 2023,"This was the weakest Ant-Man film in my opinion. It is the most ambicious one so far but because of that it has more flaws than the other two in terms of the writing. The story is full of conveniences(like the army of ants forming) and inconsintencies, the most Notorious being the main villain's power. At some points it seems like he can use his powers in a way similar to the force in Star Wars, but at the times where he needs it the most it is like he forgets he can do so. Kang's Main strength should be his inteligence since he discovered how to travel through the multiverse, makeing machines like Iron Man to avoid these inconsistencies. He should be like a Rick Sanchez villain and he would work way better."
5," The definition of a mediocre movie.
",theochatkin,/user/ur155237938/,16 February 2023,"Starting off with Cassey, she's probably one of the worst actresses that I have ever seen acting in the MCU, And oh boy have i seen bad actors here. This movie doesn't have a direction, it starts shooting towards all directions in hopes to some of each succeed. That, unfortunately, didn't happen. Of course, I am delighted to watch an Ant-Man movie once again, and have the chance to watch Loki and a glimpse of his return? That kind of scrambled my emotions. Because I really enjoyed the Loki TV show and the path it has gotten. Sincerely, when I witnessed KANG THE CONQUEROR, the man who saw all possible futures and endings were defeated by some very smart ants. I just wanted to leave. But I stayed in hopes to watch Loki, which happened, So, a fair trade."
3," Worst MCU movie ever!
",jaybee-reyes,/user/ur26538660/,15 February 2023,This was the worst MCU movie I've ever seen. It felt like I was watching a B movie. Script was horrible. Looks like the movie was just counting on cgi which is hard to appreciate after watching Avatar:The Way of Water. There was too much comic relief being forced all throughout the movie which just didn't work as well as in previous Ant-Man movies. There are also some plot holes when you think back to the end of Ant-Man and the Wasp. Janet Van Dyne was perfectly ok with Scott trying to get back to the quantum realm then all of a sudden in this movie she is totally fearful of making any attempt to do so.
9," Phase 5 got off to a very good start.
",brianlespoir,/user/ur153347358/,15 February 2023,"I'm not a fan, but still the best of 3 Ant Man movies, because I love the kind of Sci-Fi scenes they use, a mixture of Star Trek and Guardians of the Galaxy. Action packed and not a moment boring, but didn't meet my expectations.I expected to see more Lord Krylar, his appearance was very short with not enough back story. They could have made it a 3 hour movie without losing focus. It was even a bit annoying that Janet van Dyne kept her past in the Quantum Realm a secret. They could have made better use of her story and let Michelle Pfeifer take the spotlight a little longer.Hope van Dyne and Dr, Hank Pym where barely visible and could have used better writing.Jonathan Majors as Kang was all I could hope for. Didn't fall short, but there was enough left for future phase 5 movies.CGI was good, but not perfect and sometimes even very bad. Seems like Disney is not on top of it's game.Personal expectations and preferences aside, I still give this a 9."
4," A very pretty - but convoluted - mess
",HardLight,/user/ur3283404/,15 February 2023,"I've not liked much of the MCU in the last...2 years or so, I've had criticisms for it that some have thought aren't worthy criticisms and some have actually gotten upset at, but I've stuck true to my view that it's been a largely forgettable hodgepodge of mistakes and missed opportunities with a majority of writing very isolated and locked off with more focus on streaming Series than making a good plot for a movie.So that's not a good start going into this movie, the MCU had a large hill to climb to get back on track and I hate to say it but they failed again, but where to go from this as I'm not going to spoil things as I don't really want to talk about the plot as it's not that interesting, a villain is introduced that I'm not invested in as he's not been built up, but dropped in front of us and we're told to love this - again, without development of pace...again.I'm sort of ready to completely drop all Superhero movies from this point onwards as nothing is working, it's filled with irrelevance and can only get worse from here.Admittedly, everything LOOKS nice, but it's just superficial pretty colours on the screen to distract you from the very paper thin plot, weak characters and stilted and distracting acting, I keep mentioning it can't get worse with each new installment but I expect it will."

",teddie-03153,/user/ur161131007/,15 February 2023,"Couple of flaws here and there, overall it was a good movie. The pace was good, didn't really get bored. Acting was good and the new Cassie wasn't really that bad at all but I really wish they would do a little bit more with her character. She should've had a bigger role in this story. Overall the movie was very well executed even though it was a little predictable, and it has some funny moments as well. They did a good job with Kang as well and the effects were good as always. I feel though that the movie could've been s little bit longer and I think it would do a lot for the story as well, maybe we will get some good deleted scenes in the future. I give it a solid 7."
7," It's honestly a 6.5.
",thape-d,/user/ur33147742/,15 February 2023,"The movie is good in respect to the fact that it continues to build upon everything established in the previous films regarding the quantum realm and Janet van dyne's story. The story itself is a bit thin but when you accept that it's not really about the main stars in the title, but KANG and Janet, you can really see what they're trying to do and that is to establish the new narrative going forward and everything it entails. Overall, KANG will be a very formidable foe for everybody. Looking forward to the rest of phase 4 and 5 and finding out Kang's motivations for doing what he does and why he does it. Also hoping for more involvement from Scott in the future.Ant-man and the wasp only in name."
7," Kang pulled his punches?
",glennmeerten06,/user/ur54651770/,15 February 2023,"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential."
5," One word: Disappointing
",ItsRobinTV,/user/ur154814932/,15 February 2023,"I looked forward to Kang joining the Antman trilogy and I was very excited what they are going to make with him, so I went to the first possible screening of the movie and yup it wasn't good...So to start with good things, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang. He is just a talented actor just as Micheal Douglas as Hank Pym. But that's pretty much it...The movie feels like a cheap and bad copy/mix of Ready Player One and Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and I am a person who loves both of the movies. The movie introduces us a character, who we know (I won't spoil who), in a new form which makes this character with high potential to a ridiculous character about we only laugh! I mean, common Marvel, you don't have to make everything a joke.So if you ask me if the movie is better then the first two? Definitely not."
4," Thank goodness Gunn has moved to DC!
",michaelmavromatis,/user/ur62267835/,15 February 2023,"Childish and disappointing frankly, all of the hallmarks of James Gunn'n recent developments. I had hoped for this movie, thinking this might finally redeem the failures of Marvels recent productions, but not even close.For starters, the expectation that we are finally going to meet a villain so dark and sinister, who knows no compassion, all powerful and, frankly, undefeated, only to be taken out by a few ants and a broken suit is just lazy writing.Obviously, expecting any higher moralistic narrative from Hollywood is like watching paint dry, but this has nothing that will speak to any intelligent person who has half a brain.Seriously, I have been Marvel-bored since the last fase. I think we should all just move on. They have lost their mojo and Marvel/Disney need to stop pumping out this garbage!"
9," Really good
",leonffe,/user/ur101681655/,15 February 2023,"This was really good. The humor was toned down a bit from the previous movie. The movie could've been bit shorter, by cutting some scenes which show the scale of the army and revolution.I liked Cassie's actress much more in this movie than in Endgame. She seemed much more similar to the young girl from earlier movies. Having million weird characters was quite funny.They decided to make modok into this weird blob of uncanny valley. Though I liked that it brought end to the Yellow Jacket's story line. He also worked as an excellent comic relief.I noticed some similarities to Attack of the clones in some battle scenes and scenes that introduced the Kang's army."
8," Disappointment and waste
",sebastiansoenderup,/user/ur153365474/,15 February 2023,"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania and especially because of it's villain: Kang The Conqueror was hyped up to be what kicks of Phase 5 and brought excitement around the world. Disappointment is what follows. Jonathan Majors, Kang 'The Conqueror' was menacing and terrifying and a large part of Marvel Audience cheered him up to break free and rule in the Avengers ""Kang Dynasty"" Marvel (as always) shot down those hopes and killed him off.The whole movie was great in my opinion, but the last 20 min, ruined it. What is the point in building up Kang The Conqueror throughout all promo for the movie and including in the movie itself to just kill him off. He can kill avengers and whole timelines - but he can't defend himself against some ants. And i wont get started on M. O. D. O. K who was a ""killing machine"" and didn't proceed to kill anyone of significance at all.Antman and the Wasp: Quantumania had incredible potential to kick off Phase 5 with a bang, but in the end, everything that happened didn't have any significance for the future other then some funny looking kangs seen in the End-Credits scene that the audience has no connection with.The future of Marvel looks dark and i am not excited anymore."
10," A return to the Marvel we love
",speeding_motorcycle,/user/ur13169810/,15 February 2023,"Phase 5 is finally here after many sidesteps, back-steps and in the case of Thor Love and Thunder a catastrophic collapse in Phase 4. What a return to form this was as well. A great story well told, the reason Marvel is where it is. The mixture of all the pieces just right, the magic Marvel formula after almost feeling like it was lost for good found down the back of a couch and resurrected once again. I don't want to give away the plot or rave about any separate elements because the magic was it all together. The word cohesive from the first second to last should be music to fans ears. The most fun I have had at the cinema since No Way Home."
8," Important for the timeline, both exciting and boring
",djukicboris,/user/ur36643357/,15 February 2023,"If you're a Marvel fan, you cannot avoid this film because it sets up future storyline maybe more than other marvel films last year.It has spectacular visuals and great acting and the story is relatively interesting for a third Ant Man movie, it just feels a bit dull and dragged at times. Not that funny either, but I enjoyed it overall.Paul Rudd is brilliant, Evangeline as well and they continue to be a great duo from the End Game with an addition of their daughter in this one. Bill Murrey gave the same impression as Jeff Goldblum in Thor 3 and he did a great job for the role he got.I would recommend."
9," A near-perfect super hero movie!
",martwiller-948-644122,/user/ur51361386/,15 February 2023,"I'm a huge fan of the MCU, but lately it's dragged on a bit. No Way Home was a masterpiece, and so was Multiverse of Madness. But Ms. Marvel, Love and Thunder, She-Hulk and Black Panther 2 felt kinda mediocre in comparrison. Don't get me wrong. Even ""mediocre"" MCU is better than 95% of everything else.In that light, Quantumania is stellar! Great story, funny performances and flawless execution, makes this one the most epic ride since Endgame.Finally it's all coming together. The multiverse storyline has been a long time coming, but it's beginning to make sense now. We can expect further delvings into this, in upcoming The Marvels, Loki season 2, Fantastic Four etc.The future looks bright, and the MCU seems to be back on track!"
9," Personally I loved the movie, not everything tho!
",mauritsderuijter,/user/ur34997217/,15 February 2023,"If anything you need to go see it for Jonathan Majors performance. I didn't really love his performance at the end of Loki season 1 in the sense that it didn't really make an impact on me. He did exactly that in this movie. The acting was great, his look was great, the story was great, but the movie overall was just good. In my opinion Majors really made this movie, so that's why I rated it so high. The rest of the movie is okay and didn't really impact me neither. It was really cool to play around with some quantum and time aspects too, overall great fun, good not great movie, but some great performances!"
6," Enjoyable but had more potential
",adamdahlin96,/user/ur43193891/,15 February 2023,"So, phase 5's grand start: Quantamania.I would say, without spoiling anything, the movie is okay but could have been so much more. They said that this would be an ""Avengers level"" movie, but it does not feel like that. This movie feels mostly like a setup for whats to come, but does not really focus on what the previous Ant-man did good which was family comedy. It feels like its too short but at the same time has scenes that could have been cut out completely for more time with Kang. The first half was sometimes down right boring but it picks up in the 2nd half.What I will give the movie, is that they have given the quantum realm a real cool atmosphere and it feels like a place that will still serve some purpose in the future. Jonathan majors delivers hard as Kang and Paul Rudd has nice chemistry with Cassie's actress.Overall, As a start for Kang's story, it delivers pretty good but it does not hold up as a stand alone story."
8," 7.5 and the ugly enjoyment of it
",gilmoretelevision,/user/ur158641084/,15 February 2023,"The movie is enjoyable for me mainly because i didn't watch any of the trailers, i thinkIts marvel so the magic system and power dynamics is non existent or random, for example kang's powers disappearing at the final act and ants are in a time dilation and evolved to a type 2 civillizationScott's character arc is weird, its very confusing on what is his purpose to the storyThere are skips in the movie, like when scott and his daugther (cassie lang) getting caught and then suddenly his daugther already drinked the talk juice, also when the multiverse ball was shrunk and suddenly the girl is hidden, skipped when suddenly kang is on a chairVisual is good.Storywise:
They only defeated a variant of kang not the kang who rules everythingRat beating thanos, ants beating kangThe other kangs will attack earth because they were able to kill a variant of kang so ant vs kangs again probably."
6," Standard Marvel Stuff
",sho-09292,/user/ur97342765/,15 February 2023,"Pretty average, it feels like a lot of movie tropes slapped together. There were some good moments but everything was really reduced to a punchline in the end (Kinda like Love & Thunder). There were some emotional tones but nothing really sticks together. Doesn't help that everything except the main cast faces is extremely obvious CGI. Not much room for disbelief to be suspended. I did like the villains for the most part, Kang is definitely not a Thanos (yet), but he has the right tone and I like that he is considerably different from Thanos. The rest of the characters are just kinda rediculous and the Quantum Realm is apparently just a big Star Wars cantina. I was happy surprised with MODOK, except it just end with him being essentially a joke, like many good things in this film."
7," NOTHING MIND BLOWING. GOOD START FOR PHASE 5.
",andrewchristianjr,/user/ur79190944/,15 February 2023,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. A spin on the Ant-man franchise and for me was a hit! Feels like a contextual vehicle for Kang the Conqueror. Some elements don't quite work. But those are minimal, and I didn't leave the cinema effected negatively by them in any way. Scale is big acting was impressive! Comedy aspect to the franchise still still very alive. It all worked and flowed in a fun weird way. Nothing mind blowing.Synopsis:
Super-Hero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), the family finds themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible."
3," Extremely Disappointing..
",vibemarketingbkk,/user/ur158888274/,15 February 2023,"I'm a huge Marvel fan, and I always look forward to every single Marvel Studios creation.However, this will probably go down in history as the worst Marvel movie ever made. It's slow, boring and extremely messy. Messed up storyline and I almost fell asleep 50mins in.It feels way too long despite only being 2 hours long. The beginning is messy and tries to be fun and giggly, but it's not really working that well. Some sequences are alright and a bit funny, but if funny is Guardians of The Galaxy - then this is not funny at all.. it's the worst Marvel movie...actually worse than Doctor Strange & The Multiverse of Madness. This is also in the multiverse, and it is pure madness...that dissipates into pure boredom ðŸ¤£"
1," Sorry To Say MARVEL is losing their charm after Endgame
",hassamzafar-86443,/user/ur108314335/,15 February 2023,"Phase 4 is a complete let down for marvel cinematic universe after watching quantum mania it's clear that many marvel fans realize it that what they are lacking at they cast big names stars like Christian Bale , Michael Douglas , Silvester stallion , Merely Streep, and waste their potential of emotional touch they can give in this movies we all know Kang will not going to loos because we know the title of final avengers movie name Kang dynasty how many time marvel show weak villain turn into giant and giant villain into weakest one marvel is lacking a strong villain we want someone who gave tough competition to superheroes then marvel will bounce back otherwise it's just another Disney movie like multiverse of madness Scarlet witch was a toughest villain but God butcher is nothingMy point is we have so many superheroes now marvel want many strong villain which even make rated r hulk think twice before fighting him ...Cgi ride and theme park is enough for Disney marvel movies now thier fans grown on the era of Amazon Prime The Boys the competition is so tough for superheroes."
4," Johnathan Majors and Paul Rudd crushed their characters, and they deserve a better script.
",josephyu-38379,/user/ur162352224/,15 February 2023,"Just watched the movie. Quantumania tried to be Star Wars and failed, and the final battle was simply a ripoff of Ready Player One. Not to mention the cringe lines said by Cassie to Modok and Scott when he's seeking revenge on Kang. As for Jonathan Majors, he crushed the role and truly became the terrifying Conqueror. Paul Rudd also never fails to deliver the beloved, humorous character Ant-Man. Overall, the film would meet the public expectations more with a more original and intriguing script.As a fan of the MCU, I've watched every movie and show. This movie is probably a straight 4/10 for me. Pls don't let my feelings about the movie influence you if you haven't watched it. Feel free to share your thoughts about the movie even if you don't agree with me. Luv y'all!"

",ethan-49154,/user/ur153092738/,15 February 2023,"I'm a huge marvel fan. In fact, I loved the first two Antman films. However, I am very angry at this new film. They really let us down here.For starters, the visual effects aren't as top notch as you would expect from a high budget marvel film. I was definitely a little upset on that front.Secondly, absolutely no plot. It's simply a terrible build up to all the other films with Kang. Fair enough, it's pretty necessary but it's just annoyingly useless.Thirdly, it's simply boring. It's just lacking in everything and the script was just lazy writing. They clearly didn't put enough time and effort and didn't take it seriously enough!"
7," Another solid entry, great visuals and satisfying ending
",gavinp9,/user/ur21319675/,15 February 2023,"'Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania' (or Ant-Man 3) is the thirty-something-th MCU film, but it's always good to see Paul Rudd back as Scott Lang - he brings the right level of charm and goofball-ness, balanced with his determination and morality. Good to see the one director get to do all three films in a trilogy, with a few nods back to the original film (now 8 years ago!).""QuANTuMANia"" follows the combined family - Scott, Hope (Lilly), daughter Cassie (Newton), Hope's Mum Janet (Pfeiffer) & Dad Hank (Douglas) - as they're sucked into the quantum realm and try to get their way back to Earth. I like the concept of the quantum realm - no-one to call for help, existing outside of space & time, lots of exotic things/creatures + it looks cool with all the CGI! They're sucked into a war that they didn't know Janet had been part of and we get to meet Kang The Conqueror (Majors), who looks like being the new Thanos for the next series of MCU films.There's some similarities to the Star Wars sequels, especially with the ""aliens"", otherworldly colours/settings and the final act. But, as with the other two Ant-Man films (this might be better than the 2nd one), Hank Pym (the real Ant-Man) & Hope (the Wasp) are the real unsung heroes. All the actors get something to do, there's a few good cameos, but nothing too substantial and the film doesn't always go where you expect. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing.Overall: Another solid entry, great visuals and satisfying ending."

Me neither.This movie has none of the stuff that made me like the first one (and even the second one to some extent)But what it does have is CGI.LOADS of it.What it does have is lots of yelling and screaming and shrinking and growing and bla bla bla boring empty spectacle.There's no heart here. No real story.Nothing compelling or even that interesting.Hollywood please can we just take a little more time and effort to actually write something worth watching?10 stars for the overworked and underpaid CGI teams.4 stars for the acting (they really tried with what they were given)1 star for the story if you can call it that.Overall 3 stars.If you want some bland entertainment and a forgettable night out feel free to watch it. Hopefully you'll enjoy some good company and some popcorn while you yawn and look at your watch.Otherwise just wait a few weeks till it comes out on Disney plus.Or just read the synopsis. Ittl take about 30 seconds and you'll have most of the details covered.

",evasmum,/user/ur2538544/,15 February 2023,"What on earth has gone wrong with Marvel? Why are they continuing to suck the joy out of this universe by focussing on the boring Multiverse?This was a derivative, disappointing waste of time - and I really wish I'd stayed home and watched ""Everything, Everywhere"" again instead.Competent acting, and some nice effects save it from a lower score - however I suspect I'm being kind because I enjoyed the opening 5 minutes.There is no character development snd (even worse) a wafer thin narrative that's been thrown together simply to hang some bloated special effects off. In truth it reminded me of Star Wars parts 1-3. A boring, disappointing and predictable film."

",colston-83156,/user/ur161782430/,15 February 2023,"Really enjoyed the movie. Was far far better than Love and Thunder and I enjoyed it more than Wakanda Forever. I'm quite surprised at the low scores, this was as good as the 2nd ant man, if you liked that and liked the first then you will enjoy this one as I did. The plot was sound, the GGI was fine but nothing compared to something like Shang-Chi. The characters are basically the same as in the other ant man movies, however Kang was an absolute standout here. One of the best villains so far in the MCU and this movie makes me incredibly excited to see where they take his character. Highly recommend."

",kcraven-81494,/user/ur128338054/,15 February 2023,"Just walked out of one of the first screenings in New Zealand, the movie was flippen epic!!!Paul Rudd as usual kills it as Antman! Jonathan Majors acting as Kang is beyond this world, it's like he was born to play Kang. Michael Douglas was class ehuch isnt a surprise and there were a few new characters who played amazing parts! The reason it isn't a 10 is because I thought Kathryn Newton should not have played Cassie, they should have kept Emma Fuhrmann. Newtons acting was meh at best.This is honestly a must watch for every true Marvel fan, best thing they've pumped out in a long time and I'd arguably put it in my top five marvel movies of all time! The hate this is receiving I don't understand, the jokes hit, the visuals were class, the story was awesome, the future looks amazing and it's a good stepping stone towards a bigger universe!Just remember
Always look out for the little guy."
7," Better balanced blend of action vs comedy, VFX bounce-back
",brandonmckay8,/user/ur55625626/,15 February 2023,"Caught an advanced screening of this tonight & despite the negative reviews I had read this was pleasantly surprising for me. The blend of action, storytelling & comedy was much better balanced than recent Marvel films, the visual effects were beautiful, also much better than recent additions. I did enjoy the first two Ant-Man's better than this one but found this one was most definitely worth a trip to the cinema. Kathryn Newton very well casted for Cassie & adds well to the movie. Some moments with Scott were really beautifully done along with some humour, especially early on. Cassie's admiration for Jentorra was really cool & the 'just stop being a dick' to Darren (who returns in a funny way) was brilliant. Loved Paul Rudd's delivery of this line:
Kang: You're not the one with the hammer?Scott: That's Thor. We get confused a lot. Similar body types.Overall this movie is better than a lot of recent marvel films but not as good as the franchise once was. There are two credit scenes, one near the start of the credits & one right at the end."
10," Not the best Antman but you will enjoy it
",hputra-87881,/user/ur158499025/,15 February 2023,"I just watched this, and I think it's safe to say that I love it; the storyline may not be the solid one, but it is still the fun Antman I used to watch. The film brought some heavy storyline for the MCU phase 4, so I understand why this film can't be as entertaining as ant-man and the wasp.I love Kathrine newton's performance and can't wait for more concerts in young Avengers, but king's performance steals the show. You may know the yellow jacket would be there, and I guess he plays a fit role in this antman movieanything I didn't like about this movie is just the missing the van gang performance, i miss Luis."
5," Not good
",unsure-1,/user/ur6830715/,15 February 2023,"Really wanted to like this.Lazy jokes that even Paul Rudd's comedic timing can't remedy. Everyone but Jonathan Majors phoned in their performance. The daughter character is just hard to stomach, some of the cringiest lines and the most wooden, vanilla acting in a while. The ""don't be a dick"" scene was one of the worst.Couldn't get the Council of Ricks impression out of my head watching the mid-credits scene. Despite near-constant action, boring. The few good things: some set design and CGI & the pink blob character were fun, looked great. Michael Douglas & Bill Murray phone it in and still manage to steal scenes.I'm probably going to watch the rest of the phase by inertia, but damn, this is a far cry from anything in Phase 2-3."
7," More a Marvel film than an Ant-Man/Wasp Film
",ossie85,/user/ur20159693/,15 February 2023,"If I'm honest, the Ant-Man franchise has never been a huge favourite of mine. I liked the first film enough, but the second left me a bit cold.So I can understand why many of the critics didn't like this film, if they were expecting something similar to the first two Ant-Man films.This film was more done to flesh out the greater Marvel lore, and to give the terrific Jonathan Majors a show piece for his Kang.That's not to say Ant-Man and The Wasp aren't important for the story, they provide the heart and personal stakes for us the viewers to connect with.The movie is far from perfect, but I'm in it for the world building as much as the characters. I had a lot of fun, and the good outweighs the mediocre by quite a bit."
9," That's how I like my Marvel movies
",chrisionvision,/user/ur113178755/,15 February 2023,"I really liked this movie. It was probably the second one after Avengers: Endgame that got me really interested in and that I was excited for, before it started.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantummania really is the first Marvel movie in a long time that got its balance right: It got some weird but fun ideas, sympathetic main characters and just the right amount and kind of humor between the needed seriousness.Additionally, it gave a deeper insight into the next ""Big Bad"" of the MCU (even though it was still rather superficial). This was underlined by an other greate thing I missed in a lot of recent Marvel movies: post credit secenes, that give a meaningful hint on the future without telling too much. Just the right amount to get hyped and speculate further.If Phase 5 continues like this, the MCU could get greate again.I would give it 8,5/10, so I generously rounded up a bit. :)"
," I can't relate to it
",Gordon-11,/user/ur0035842/,15 February 2023,"This film tells the story of Ant Man and his family entering the Quantum realm, causing a lot of adventures and dangers to ensue.""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is visually impressive, as there are multiple fantasy science fiction worlds to depict. The imagination runs wild with some of the unearthly characters. The story appears to me rather flat, but that is perhaps due to my lack of love for fantasy realms. To me, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" looks more like a fantasy film than a superhero film. I am not able to relate to the characters or their world. I would have preferred a superhero film to be set in a relatable world."
7," You're out of your league, Ant-Man!
",MiroslavKyuranov,/user/ur57827313/,15 February 2023,"""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" is a psychedelic science fiction rollercoaster full of frightening and hilarious surprises, but don't overstay your welcome in the Quanatum realm too much, because Kang is watching every step of yours!""Quantumania"" is a good start to Phase 5 and you can see the future trajectory of the MCU and where it goes. It's exciting for sure! It works better as a first chapter of ""The Kang Dynasty"", than a third movie in a franchise, but this is not a bad thing, because if you're there for Kang, you will enjoy the heck out of this movie.Jonathan Majors effortlessly conquers every second of screen-time he gets. He is charismatic, intense and brutal and his presence is felt among everybody else. The dynamic between Scott and Cassie is the heart of the movie, but it feels like something is missing, just like Scott wasn't there for Cassie. We don't see how she become a hero too, which is strange. Also the character of Ant-Man stays in the shadow of Kang in his own movie. The rest of the cast is just fine, maybe standing a bit more out is kick-ass Michelle Pfeiffer.The comedy is there and it hits most of the time, but this one is not as funny as the previous two movies for sure, there are some huge stakes. The Quantum realm looks really good, particularly some scenes, just captivating visually. There are other things that are just weird, but in a good way. Most of them works pretty fine.The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is good.For sure this is the biggest of the three films in scale, but I think the small scale was the mark of the ""Ant-Man"" franchise, now it feels like some of the hearth of the movie is missing.It is a good mid tier MCU movie and with the proper expectations you gonna enjoy it. I was hyped for Kang and got what I want.The idea to put the tiniest Avenger versus the biggest, baddest villain in the MCU is ambitious and it pays off well for the future projects. There are two credit scenes, both very important and you don't want to miss them!"
8," Blends small and big into a fun movie
",FilmFanatic2023,/user/ur159666074/,15 February 2023,"The ""Ant-Man"" films' unspoken motto is ""think small,"" but ""Quantumania"" shows how they can do both small and big. Scott Lange and other major characters find themselves battling a supervillain in the Quantum Realm. While there, they face new challenges, such as houses that look like Fred Flintstone's home mated with the Pillsbury Dough Boy, and gelatinous bugs and other critters. Despite some amusing jokes, the world mostly looks like a Marvel screen-saver, with effects companies pre-visualizing much of the running time. The new villain, Kang, is a fearsome and all-powerful character, but poorly written, and the filmmakers struggle to make him seem terrifying. The cast does their best to work with the material, and Michelle Pfeiffer shines, pushing the plot forward and papering over cracks in the storytelling. The movie mainly revolves around Scott and Cassie, who is now a teenager with her suit, but Hope (The Wasp) is present and involved, but doesn't make much of an impression. The film doesn't have the nerve to wipe the smile off the audience's face like in ""Infinity War"" or ""Temple of Doom,"" but still, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a fun ride that both long-time fans and casual viewers will enjoy."
